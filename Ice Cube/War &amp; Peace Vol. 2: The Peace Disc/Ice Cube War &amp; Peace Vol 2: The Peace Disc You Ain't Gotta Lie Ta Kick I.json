(punk)\nAnd your little ass car's full of fender benz\nThere you go on the stand with your hand up (lyin')\nTestifyin' about a man that's in handcuffs\nWe should do you like the Mack said\nAnd if he lie like a crackhead pop 'em like a black head\nLet him ooze, let him loose\nLet him lie by his motherfuckin' ass on the news (yeah yeah)\n\n\nYo Cube, check out this ring, 69 karots\n\n--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--\n\nIt's Kryptonite nigga, Kryptonite!\n\n--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--\n\n\nTell your mama, tell your daddy, tell your auntie\n\n--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--\n\nTell your cousin, tell your sister, if she want me\n\n--You ain't got to lie ta kick it--\n",
