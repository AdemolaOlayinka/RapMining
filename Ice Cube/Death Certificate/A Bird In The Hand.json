I was cleaning out my nest\nand I found a book of my old poetry\n\n\nFresh out of school cause I was a high school grad\ngots to get a job cuz I was a high school dad\nWish I got paid like I was rappin' to the nation\nbut thats not likely, so here's my application\nPass it to the man at AT&T\nCuz when I was in school I got the a. e. e.\nBut there's no s. e. for this youngsta\nI didn't have no money so now I have to hunch the\nBack like a slave, thats what be happenin\nbut whitey says there's no room for the African\nAlways knew that I would boycott, jeez\nbut welcome to McDonalds can I take your order please\nGotta sell ya food that might give you cancer\ncuz my baby doesn't take no for an answer\nNow I pay taxes that you never give me back\nwhat about diapers, bottles, and similac\nDo I gotta go sell me a whole lotta crack\nfor decent shelter and clothes on my back?\nOr should I just wait for help from Bush\nor Jesse Jackson, and operation Push\nIf you ask me the whole thing needs a douch\na masengel what the hell cracker sale in the neighborhood\nTo the whorehouse bitches,\nMiss porker, little joe or Todd Bridges\nOr anybody that he know\nso I got me a bird, better known as a kilo\nNow everybody know I went from po' to a nigga that got dough\nSo now you put the feds against me\ncause I couldn't follow the plan of the presidency\nI'm never givin' love again\nCuz blacks are too fuckin broke to be republican\nNow I remember I used to be cool\ntill I stopped fillin' out my W-2\nNow senators are gettin' hired\nand your plan against the ghetto backfired\nSo now you got a pep talk\nbut sorry, this is our only room to walk\nCause we don't want a drug push\nBut a bird in the hand is worth more than the bush\n\ntell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)\ntell the politicians, the hustlers: live and let live (yeah)\n",
