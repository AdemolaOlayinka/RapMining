    "lyrics": "Here's another day at the stoplight\nI'm lookin in my mirror so I can see who can see me\nSouth Central is puttin Ice Cube to the test\nWith four brothas in the SS\nI can't go around and can't back up\nSo I gotta peep game layin in the cut\nIs this a jack or a kidnap?\nSince I'm never ever slippin I fully strapped\nI grab my gat out the glove\nNow, do these fools got a problem with me?\nOr do they got love?\nSo when the light turns green, I don't bone out\nI wanna see what these black men are all about\nCuz if it's my time, I'm just short\nIf not, I'm pluggin they Super Sport\nFirst they get behind my ride...\nThen they switch lanes to the left side\nI'm scopin out the one smokin indo\nComin up fast, rollin down his window\nHe threw up a sign, I put away my nine\nFool, cuz I'm color blind\n\n\nKilla Cali, the state where they kill\nOver colors cuz brothas don't know the deal\nAnd they'll cap you, not if they have to\nBut if they want to, first they might confront you\nBut every nigga on my block can't stop\nAnd he won't stop and he don't stop\nNot to the bang bang boogie, but they like to gangbang\nAnd rookies ain't the only ones that drop\nSome say the little locs are gettin a little too loc'ed\nAnd when it comes to dust, they kick up the most\nSay the wrong word\nthen whistle down the street to your homies like a bird\nBust a u-turn, come back and get served nigga\nFor the women, it don't matter how loud they blouse get\nBut men, the wrong color outfit, could get your mouth split\nIt's a shame, but it ain't no thang to me\nCuz I slang these thangs like a G\nIt's on, is anybody killin for the summertime\nI gotta get another nine, even though I'm colorblind\n\n\nI'm fresh outta county on bail\nAnd no sooner do I get out, seems like I'm right back in jail\nFor some gang related activity\nCuz everyday, different fools try to get with me\nFor no more than a color, or territory\nCan't rehabilitate 'em, that's the sheriff's story\nSo what's left, the judge goes deaf\nWhen you try to tell your side\nAnd you ain't blue eyed\nBoy you better duck cuz the book is comin'\nAnd just hand your car keys over to your woman\nBecause it aint no sunshine where you headed\nAnd the shit'll drive you crazy if you let it\nBut now, I got time to think\nBecause they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink\nAnd I ain't even shed a tear\nCuz believe it or not, they got more love for me here\nNow picture that, but on a black and white photograph\nCuz brothas, you don't know the half\nOn the streets I was damn near outta my mind\nBut ever since I've been down\nI'm colorblind\n\n\nNow here's the game plan, yo, at a quarter to nine\nI was told to peel a cap on the other side\nYo, young and dumb, full of come up, a baby loc\nI gotta put in work for the hood and that ain't no joke\n\n\nStable and able but I'm not ready and willin\nCuz I'm only 13 and I ain't never did a killin\nGrabbed the A.K. and jumped in the G ride\nStarted up the bucket and headed for the other side\n\n\nYo, spotted the enemies, now I'm on a creep tip\nHit the 5 dollar stick and then I put in my clip\n\n\nSo, I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost\nI had my mind set on sendin niggaz to Harrison Ross\n\n\nCaught one from the back and I looked in eyes\nThinkin should I peel his cap, or should I let him survive\nYo, I'm trapped in the plan designed by another side\n\n\nI ain't contributin to genocide (why?)\nCuz I'm colorblind\n\n\nNiggaz in the hood ain't changed\nAnd I've finally figure out that we're not in the same gang\nCuz, I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn\nEvery which way I get burned baby\nLou wears blue, Big Fred wears red\nPut 'em together and we color 'em dead\nDead, dyin, gettin smoked like part of the fun\nThey get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral\n\n\nI understand how all my homeboys feel\nCuz I was shot and to this day, I pack my steel\nCuz I was born in a certain territory\nWhere you don't talk only the streets tell stories\nWith blue and red bandanas on the street\nAnd if you slippin, you'll be six feet deep\nCuz me and T-bone, we pay it no mind\nAnd for the rest of the mob, we stay color blind. . .\n",
