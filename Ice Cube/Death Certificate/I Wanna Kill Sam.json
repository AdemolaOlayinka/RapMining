(lookin..)\nIs he in Watts, Oakland, Philly or Brooklyn?\nIt seems like he got the whole country behind him\nso it's sort of hard to find him\nBut when I do, gotta put my gat in his mouth\nPump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out\nCause the shit he did was uncalled for\ntried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore\nAnd that shit ain't fly\nSo now I'm settin up, the ultimate drive-by\nAnd when you hear this shit,\nit make the world say \"DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.\"\n\n\"Do the niggaz run this moth-er-fuck-er?\"\n\n\n\"Momma!! Some man at the front do'!\"\n\"Sit yo' ass down.\"\n\"Uhh hi.. I have reason to believe that someone in this household\nhas just turned eighteen, am I correct?\"\n\n\nHere's why I wanna kill the punk\ncause he tried to take a motherfuckin chunk of the funk\nHe came to my house, I let 'em bail in\ncause he said he was down with the L.M.\nHe gave up a little dap\nthen turned around, and pulled out a gat\nI knew it was a caper\nI said, \"Please don't kill my mother,\" so he raped her\nTied me up, took me outside\nand I was thrown in a big truck\nAnd it was packed like sardines\nFull of niggaz, who fell for the same scheme\nTook us to a place and made us work\nall day and we couldn't have shit to say\nBroke up the families forever\nand to this day black folks can't stick together\nAnd it's odd..\nBroke us down, made us pray - to his God\nAnd when I think about it,\nit make me say \"DAMN! .. I wanna kill Sam.\"\n\n\"I'm comin!\"\n\n\nNow in ninety-one, he wanna tax me\nI remember, the son of a bitch used to axe me\nand hang me by a rope til my neck snapped\nNow the sneaky motherfucker wanna ban rap\nand put me under dirt or concrete\nBut God, can see through a white sheet\nCause you the devil in drag\nYou can burn your cross well I'll burn your flag\nTry to give me the H-I-V\nso I can stop makin babies like me\nAnd you're givin dope to my people chump\nJust wait til we get over that hump\nCause yo' ass is grass cause I'ma blast\nCan't bury rap, like you buried jazz\nCause we stopped bein whores, stop doin floors\nSo bitch you can fight your own wars\nSo if you see a man in red white and blue\ngettin janked by the Lench Mob crew\nIt's a man who deserves to buckle\nI wanna kill Sam cause he ain't my motherfuckin Uncle!\n\n\"We've gone nowhere in 200 years?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n\"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n\"We-we-we've gone nowhere in 200 years?\"\n\"That's correct.\"\n",
