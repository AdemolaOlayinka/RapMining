One hundred percent pure\nCause if it's not, believe me the shit gettin hot\nI got a plot to make your whole family deaf dumb and blind\n(tell em one more time) the world is mine\n\n\nThe world is mine nigga, back up\nI gots to get mine before I act up\n\n\nIt's a quarter to eight, I'm not finished my plate\nI got a phone call to make, my niggaz tell me it's fake\nOh what a mistake, here's what I want you to break\nTie his feet with some weight, throw his ass in a lake\nAnd then set up a date, between me and his mate\nTell her lobster and steak, and bitch don't be late\nOh the pussy was great, I'm still sealin your fate\nCause you can't imitate, the nigga you love to hate\n\n\n\nCan I grin, show my fin, I'm down with mack 10\nDub-C, K-Dee, and Kausion\nIt don't stop, niggaz get to bowin a lot\nWhen we enter the spot, look all the niggaz we got\nWorldwide, nigga take a look outside\nGot a brother named Clyde, he's like Jekyll and Hyde\nIce Cube is the lick, Westside is the click\n(Can't get enough of this gangsta shit)\nYou wanna check our cajones we got the feds up on us\nWe gotta roll on Daytonas because we know that they want us\nAnd if they catch us in rap, it's a reasonable doubt\nMy niggaz pointin me out, my momma scream and she shout\nBut we got enough green, from our triple beam\nTo hire the prosecution, and the dream team\nThis world ain't nuttin but a dollar sign (ching ching)\nI'm a partner in crime, the world is mine\n\n\n\n\nYeah, you punk ass niggaz know the side, so check it\nWhen you meet us, you better bring your heaters\nCause the only way you could beat us, is if you cheat us nigga\n\n\n\n\nWe tight, ha hah\nWhere you from nigga?\nWhere you from nigga?\n(tell them one mo' time) The world is mine\nHa ha ha, Westside\n",
