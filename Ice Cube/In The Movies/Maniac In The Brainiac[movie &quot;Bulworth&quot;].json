I ain't speakin'\n\n\nShit, I gives a fuck what the next nigga think\n(?) gives a fuck how much bitch you say you ain't\nIt's like this on mine, potna\nBy all means, I got the ball\nSo it's your life, not mine nigga, so you make the call\nNow, I can blow your brains out, punk and act the fuckin' fool\nOr you can hand your guns over, and let everything be cool\nBut know this: I won't hesitate to peel your wig back\nI'm off that wet-bomb and the whole fifty yak\nIt's Mack the Maniac, nigga\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the plan? Everything thought out\nEverything bought out, like Bill Gates\nMy niggas love steel weights\nI'm still great, after 12 muthafuckin' years\nI (?) your ass after 12 muthafuckin' beers\nI act kind to my peers and everybody that listen\nThey know when the Brainiac's missin'\nThe big fish, hanging with the chicken hawk\nGot all the haters, claimin' that they wanna talk\n\n\nYou argue wit 'em and negotiate, and I really wanna kill 'em\nI'm tired of the bullshit, man I really wanna peel 'em\nDog, I knew they were scareless\n'Cause my brother Snoop told us\nSo fuck the money and the dope that they punk-ass owe us\nNow when I see 'em, it ain't no question it's all the way on\nBut I'mma wait in front of they momma house\nFor that one nigga to get home\nAnd when I gun, watch his body jump\nAnd it's all going to amaze me\nTo see his own self\nLayin' there with his own brains on the pavement\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's on... keep takin' 'til it's gone\nAnd it's on... feel the wrath of the chrome\nWessiiide!\nIce Cube the Brainiac\nMack 10 the Maniac\n",
