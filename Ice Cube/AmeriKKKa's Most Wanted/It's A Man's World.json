    "lyrics": "Women they're good for nothing no maybe one thing\nTo serve needs to my ding-a-ling\nI'm a man who loves the one-night stand\nCause after I do ya\nHuh I never knew ya\nCause to kick it man it gives me the fits\nThey wanna lay with they nose under your armpits\nIce Cube won't wait so give it up cow\nAfter we do it you can go home now\nI'm a brother with a big long...\n\nFirst of all let me tell you my name it's Yo-Yo\nWhen down on a girl first the fist and that's a no-no\nYo-Yo thinks the kitchen sink should be thrown in\nNiggas be scheming and fiending to stick the bone in\nNo, Yo-Yo's not a hoe or a whore\nAnd if that's what you're here for\nExit through the door\nThere's more\nTo see of me but you're blind so\nWomen like me are fading brothers in the 9-0\n\nAy what up buttercupper Miss Yo-Yo\nI know you like to rap and like to flow so\nBut when it comes to hip-hop this is a man's world\nStay down and play the playground you little girl\n\nWhat you're saying I don't consider it as rapping\nCause you're on rewind and I'm the new what's-happening\nIt never fails I'll always get respect\nAnd you lose so take a rain check\n\nHell no cause you know that I'm first and you're second\nIf it wasn't for me you probably be pregnant\nAnd barefoot complaining that your back is aching\nShaking and faking while I'm bringing home the bacon\n\nWell you're mistaken\nIt's not going that far\nI make brothers like you play the back yard\nYou used to flow with the title but I took it\nBring home the bacon but find another hoe to cook it\n\nDamn it look it\nCause you're talking a lot of bull\n\nWell I'm not your puppet so don't even try to pull\n\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\n\nAh Miss Yo-Yo so what gives\nI hear females always talkin about women's lib\nWell get your own crib\nAnd stay there\nInstead of having more babies for the welfare\nCause if you don't I'll label you a gold digger\nThe name is Ice Cube you know that I ain't the nigga\nFor you to look at when your hair get nappy\nSo take a piece of the pole and be happy\n\nHell no because to me you're not a thriller\nYou come in the room with your three-inch killer\nThinking you can do damage to my backbone\nLeave your child in the yard until it's full-grown\nI'm a put it like this my man\nWithout us your hand would be your best friend\nSo give us credit like you know you should\nIf I don't look good you don't look good\n\nI doubt it baby cause we're still most dominant\n\nBut you don't know how funky that I can get\n\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\n\nMan women I put a lot of fear in em\nCause I had it up to here with em\nDrink a beer with em\nNo way cause I can only deal with em about an hour every day\nYeah if you know what I mean baby\n\nWell I guess now that I think about it I think maybe\nIf you was more of a man instead of faking it\nWomen deserve the credit when they're making it\n\nYeah so what's the problem\n\nWell I think we solved it\nI know they know the best male from who's doggin it\n\nYeah I admit you can flow\n\nWell that's true\n\nBut you see I'm a pro with the bank too\n\nYeah I can see you got it good\n\nOh that I know\n\nBut you see you're not better than Yo-Yo\nThe brand-new intelligent black lady\n\nYou're kinda dope but you still can't fade me\n\nSo what up then\n\nGirl what you tryin to do\n\nTo prove a black woman like me can bring the funk through\n\nThis is a man's world thank you very much\n\nBut it wouldn't be a damn thing without a woman's touch\n\nOr a big butt...\n",
