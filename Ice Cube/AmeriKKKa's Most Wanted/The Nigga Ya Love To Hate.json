Well, fuck you\n\nOnce again it's on, the motherfucking psycho\nIce Cube the bitch killa cap peeler\nYo runnin through the line like Bo\nIt's no pot to piss in\nI put my fist in\nNow who do ya love to hate\nCause I talk shit and down the eight-ball\nCause I don't fake you're begging I fall off\nThe crossover might as well cut them balls off\nAnd get your ass ready for the lynching\nThe mob is droppin common sense and\nWe'll gank in the pen will shank\nAny Tom Dick and Hank or get the ass\nFake it ain't about how right or wrong you live\nBut how long you live\nI ain't with the bullshit\nI meet cold bitches no hoes\nDon't wanna sleep so I keep popping No-Doz\nAnd tell the young people what they gotta know\nCause I hate when niggas gotta live low\nAnd if you're locked up I dedicate my style in\nFrom San Quentin to Rykers Island\nWe got em afraid of the funky shit\nI like to clown so pump up the sound\nIn the jeep make the old ladies say\nOh my god wait it's the nigga ya love to hate\n\n\n<Fuck you Ice Cube>\nYeah come on fool\nIt's the nigga you love to hate\n<Fuck you Ice Cube>\nYeah run up punk\nIt's the nigga you love to hate\n<Yo, who the fuck you think you are calling girls bitches?\nYou ain't all that\nThat's all I hear, bitch, bitch\nI ain't nobody's bitch>\nA bitch is a....\n\nSoul Train done lost they soul\nJust call it train cause the bitches look like hoes\nI see a lotta others damn\nIt almost look like the Bandstand\nYou ask me did I like Arsenio\nAbout as much as the bicentennial\nI don't give a fuck about dissing these fools cause they all scared of\nthe Ice Cube\nAnd what I say what I portray and all that\nAnd ain't even seen the gat\nI don't wanna see no dancing\nI'm sick of that shit listen to the hit\nCause yo if I look and see another brother\nOn the video tryin to out-dance each other\nI'm a tell T-Bone to pass the bottle\nAnd don't give me that shit about role model\nIt ain't wise to chastise and preach\nJust open the eyes of each\nCause laws are made to be broken up\nWhat niggas need to do is start loc-ing up\nAnd build mold and fold theyself into shape\nOf the nigga ya love to hate\n",
