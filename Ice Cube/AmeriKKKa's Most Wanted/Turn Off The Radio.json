You know what?\nBasically those black guys and those rap guys\nThey don't know what the fuck they're doing\nI hate those fuckers\nI hate em\nEspecially that one guy\nThe AmeriKKKa's most wanted\nIce Cube--I hate that fucker\nGet him off the air, get him off, get him off\nGet that rap shit out of here!>\n<Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!>\n",
