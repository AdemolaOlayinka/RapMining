mothafuckin wannabe mack
but i'm smooth like that
i gots ta buck...you...right on up, punk you lucky that cha livin
cos i'm the unforgiven; i like power, ain't a damn thing funny

and i won't slam like onyx or never ever stutter
but i'm b-b-butter;
leader of the new school, you hard core fool!

you can lick me up and down till i yell stop!
damn bitch ya missed a drop...cos i don't play when i sway
it's the quicker picker upper;
a pro that moves slow before this hoe i'm quick
to dump her; so eeny-meeny-miney-mo, where's my dough?
i gots ta make a livin, i out ta get mo; 
money, and got more nuts for ya honey; so

it's the smoothness that make niggas move to this;

role; we still cool, but just make it smooth...


you know what, it's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
how i keep from goin under, i'm chocolate thunder;
ruff as sin, cuts on ya skin
and i blend with the tracks, see i'm black
k-dee is the mack; matter fact
niggas hit me up with the c's and b's
but you don't wanna fuck wit these
cos i'll put 'em on ya
and we'll have to wake ya mothafuckin ass up with ammonia
cos hardcore rap is always on the map and it don't stop
devoid of pop; and if i drop another smooth hit
it'll still be hard, cos i helped start this shit;

so make it ruff
