Is that your religion?\nBlack man, you gotta make a desicion\nCause God is comin' on day number seven\nAnd he won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven\n\n\n\nThe same white man that threw me in the slammer\nHe bombed the church in Alabama\nSo if I cock the hammer, God won't mind\nIf I have to kill the human swine\nCause God is a killer from the start\nWhy you think Noah had to build his ark\nAnd God is a man from his feet to his hair\nThat's why you say 'amen' after each and every prayer\nI just stare at the church man\nSpendin' more money on the church band\nBut Elijah's got a plan\nGot the white man screamin': 'Damn that Farrakhan!'\nCause one day these babies are uprise\nMuch more than bowties and bean pies\nKickin' knowledge at 7-11\nAnd they won't call me a nigga when I get to heaven\n",
