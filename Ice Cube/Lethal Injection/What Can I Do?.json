Yes\nTook some advice from my Uncle Fester\nAll dressed up in polyester\nWelcome to McDonalds may I please help you?\nsh*t, what can I do?\n\nToday...\n\n\n\nThe white man has broke every law known to man to establish AmeriKKKa.\nBut he'll put you in the state penitentary, he'll put you in the federal\npenitentary for breaking these same laws. Now we gonna look and see if\nthis muthaphucker is guilty for the laws he'll put you in jail for :\n\nDrug using, drug selling, armed robbery, strong armed robbery, grand\nlarceny, rape, racketering, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion,\naggravated assault, mayhem, sodomy of the black man, trespassing,\nembezzelment, purgery, kidnapping, smuggling, grand theft, brandishing\na firearm, carrying a conceled weapon, breaking and entering, and\npremeditated cold-blooded murder.\n\nGuilty on every charge.\n",
