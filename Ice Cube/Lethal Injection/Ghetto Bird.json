Yup\nIs it a plane? No\nI hit me a right on El Segundo\nWanted to holla, had to ditch the Impala\nLet's see if they would folla\nMe, hit a fence, hit a fence, and another\nmet me a baby pitbull and his mother\nRan up in some peoples house and looked out of the window\nI wish it was my ten-four\nhad to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third\ncuz I'm getting chased by the ghetto bird\n\n\"Just put his hat, ehrrr, he combed his hair and then put his hat back\non. Errr, he's acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit, going 115\nmiles an hour, with the police chasing him. Ehm, they're not gonna be\nreal happy when they catch up with him, no matter what, the eh...\nEhrr, they hate, they hate a bigmouth even worse.\"\n\n\n\nOfficer Bird's on his way, and I don't wanna see him\ncould you please give me the keys to the B.M.?\nSee, I didn't want to gank you\nbut don't make me bank you, thank you\nTried to get yo the hood, and you might guess\nthat a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus\nIncognito, Ghetto Eagle\nSaying, \"Fuck, where did he go?\"\nI bust me a left from Rubellon. Park\nThe 735 and I'm bailin\nWent to my homegirl's house and got a hug man,\nShe helped me run like Harriet Tubman\nLooked out the window by the black bed\nI saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed\nThen the light from the bird hit me in the face\nI close the blinds cause I didn't wanna catch a case\nAll that night, I heard the bird circle\nwhile I was eating fish and watching Urkel\nShe said I could sleep on the couch\nBy two A.M. I was digging her out\nFuck the ghetto bird\n\n\"Which way is he going now?\"\n\"Ok, now..now he's..he's actually southbound..on a service street..\nand, uh...Gee whiz, uh, I'm gonna get my maps out here and figure\nout which service srteet he suddelny turned off on. Uh, the sherriffs\nare..are...well I know that...Sherriffs ground units got thrown off\"\n\nMotherfuck you and your punk-ass ghetto bird\n",
