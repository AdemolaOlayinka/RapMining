Nimble, and Jack B. Quick\nif you wanna jack me on a lick, cause\nI'm that fool from South Central\nYou think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil\nThat's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass\nWith \"Mo' Bounce to the Ounce\" in the dash\nMash up, Ve-nice, headed for the West\nEverything is great, slow down for the dip\nOn a 100 and 8th and keep mashin\nDon't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin\nStashin a glock and I thought you knew it\nYou know how we do it\n\nComin from the West Side, West Side\nNuttin but a West Side\nIt's hittin on the West Side\nFool, you know how we do it\n",
