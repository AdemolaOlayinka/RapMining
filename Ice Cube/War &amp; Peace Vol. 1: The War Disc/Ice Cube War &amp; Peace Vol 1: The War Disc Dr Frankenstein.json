Fool it ain't no solution\nto the evolution, of pimps and prostitution\nI cuss, skanlous, I give a rush\nto niggas who mind turn to mush, smokin on brush\nHush, I'm just a lush for this Hen\nChrome electroids, connected to my pen\nWhen, blowin motherfuckers ain't knowin what we goin through\nSpiritually, lyrically showin you\nThey call me, 'AmeriKKKa's Most Hated'\nGettin liberated by this monster I created\nDr. Frankenstein\n\n\nWe love to bump you Frankenstein\nYo' shit is the best\nTake my body and my mind\nDon't fuck with the stress\nHit me with that game to win\nIf you want, hit me again\nWe love you Frankenstein\nWe love you Frankenstein\n\n\nNow how many times did a nigga have to warn ya?\nYa fuckin up the formula (call the coroner)\nIt's outta hand, cos sucker ass niggas like you\ntry to pay the rent off my blueprint\nNew cent to the industry\nYou thought my shit was biodegradable, uh uh, it's unfadeable\nUnstoppable, runnin through your suburbs\nIncredible thug words\nWe gets down, nigga do the Monster Mash\nand watch a nigga like me collect monster cash\nCos I'm sittin wit this bitch who got monster ass\nKeep em wonderin how long the Don will last\nAnd never pass, and when I want it buttered on toast\nCan't no nigga see Ice Cube on no coast\nSo all you gotta do is focus\nand see that I'm the fuckin loccest with this hocus pocus\nDr. Frankenstein\nDr. Frankenstein, ugh\n\n\nOoooh wee, it's alive\nYou better run and hide\nCover your ears and your eyes\n",
