Punk you shoulda stuck to rappin\nNiggaz tell me you got a house full of platinum..\nWhere the platinum at motherfucker?\nI hear that shit worth more than gold!)\n\nWait a minute motherfucker, this my house!\n\nOnce upon a time in the projects\nOnce upon a time, once upon a time\n\nI'm like baffled, they got me gaffled, with the duct tape\nSo I remain raw, in come this chainsaw\nAnother knock, it's the girl from two-ten\nhere to drop salt, that's when them bitches fought\nI thought, \"I bet-ta plan my escape\"\nIn the midst of this commotion, Ice Cube is breakin tape\nI'm free, bombin on the first thing I see\nAnd guess who walk in, with a nine, and a grin\nIt's the baby daddy he ain't playin,\nHe started layin everybody down, about face with a frown\nI'm runnin to the bedroom, I lock the do'\nand grab the phone, the bitch phone ain't turned on\nI think I'm gone, that's when I hear a soft knock\nIt's the girl from two-ten, with her number, and a glock\nSaid, \"Call me up, if it's for sex, or chin check\nNigga get you a real ass bitch from the projects!\"\n\nAnd I just might do that\n\nOnce upon a time in the projects\nOnce upon a time, once upon a time\n",
