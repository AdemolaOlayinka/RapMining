I don't give a fuck where he is\nSnatch him out the factory, bring his ass back to me\nHow the fuck you think I got the NAME Bossalini? Punk\nMack God Rap Genie, you can't see me\nUp in this game ever since you was a lame\nY'all train at my school, nigga I rule\nYou never make me holla, smokin on a fifteen dollar\nfrom across the water, watch your daughter\nShe might catch the Holy Ghost from this rap sermon\nWhile you vermin smokin Sherman, I'm rollin somethin German, bitch\nMoney earnin makin mo' money (ching ching)\nEnemies look so funny, with they clothes bummy\nDon't need no honey, that's right\nCause I'm thinkin with my big head, FUCK what my dick said!\n\n\n\nWe puttin cash over ass, each and every day\nGo on let the players play..

Me!\nI'm the Big Willie for rilly, the real dilly\nYou can ask Phillie cause I got a year's supply (Yup!)\nYou must want to die, don't get the lye\nafter dark up at Griffith Park, shallow grave\nfor the mark check his heart, the game about to start\nBig thangs automatic pu-tang (automatic)\nKeep your mind off them bitches, eyes on your riches\nIf it twitches give it stitches\nIf it jiggles or switches, fuck and take pictures, now\nI'm livin in a two-point zone, and I'm still bumpin\nCall me in the clutch, ain't lost my touch\nNigga what? on the microphone\nIf I drove it in the video, bitch, I can drive it home\nTight as a Corleone\nYou got to get your own, baby get on, now\n\n\n\n\nGet your ass up and go to work, cause you know\non payday, nigga that shit gon' hurt\nFuckin with a skirt instead of handlin your bizness\nRich dude, now you got to make three wishes\nI'm suspicious, of any motherfucker puttin fuck over finance\n'Specially fuckin up my plans\nI'm the boss, I can be late\nbut you'll never see her and me, over currency\nGivin you the third degree, cause you got\ntoo many broke bitches and you like bankin for a penny\nStop fuckin on them dum-dums\nFind one with some ass and some income\nWho wanna win? Who wanna spin?\nWho wanna make, twenty-five eight? Me\nIce Cube the great.. pushin rhymes like weight\n\n\n\nNever put that hoe, in front of that dough nigga\nFor what?

(Never ass over cash)\nNever ass over cash\n",
