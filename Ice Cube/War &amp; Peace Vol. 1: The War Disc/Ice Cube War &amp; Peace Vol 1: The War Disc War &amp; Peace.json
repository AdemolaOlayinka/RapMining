(Sing it!)\nWar and peace, forever!\nWar and peace, together.. always!\n\n\n\nI'm at the highest peak, still glad the meak is understandin me\nArtillery, thoughts of killin me is just a fantasy\nThe man in me is ready for war, like Holyfield/Tyson IV\nA gang against you niggaz on the shore\nEither or, your whole family is on the floor\nWindows breakin all around em, you can't climb this mountain\nI'm at the fountain, with my troops\nI start screamin at em like Patton, we gattin at you fools!\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiate...\nstrategy is the key!\nI hope they ain't...\nexclusively after me!\nCause if they are...\nwe gots to be who we be!\nAnd make a star...\nout of a head enemy!\nThe papers said...\nthat he died tragically!\nThey found his head...\nwith no legs and bo-dy!\nWe made a pledge...\nto the Dub-S-C!\nBloodshed...\nif they got no love for peace!\nSing it!\n\n\n\n\n\nI'd rather break bread than uhh, break your head\nBreak your legs, have em broken, I ain't no joke\nDon't provoke, the gun smoke from the highest slope\nEternal peace, for my peoples and my folks\nMy crips and my bloods, criminals and my thugs\nJust show a nigga love when I'm rollin on them dubs\nJust, give a nigga hugs, we can ride on this piece\nWestside for Life but still down with the East\nSing it!\n\n\n\nAfter the haters attempt to blow up his car\nWe find our hero, Ice Cube, on the ground\nBruised, but not beaten\nHe pulls out his cell phone.. WITH THE CHIP!\nAnd begins to dial Mack One-Oh\nWho's faded and rolling through Inglewood\nwith Mr. Short KHOP\nWords.. are spoken\n",
