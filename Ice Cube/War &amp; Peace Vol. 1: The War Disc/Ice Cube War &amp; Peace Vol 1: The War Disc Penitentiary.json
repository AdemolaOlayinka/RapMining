In the justice system\"\n\nPenitentiary, I hear you calling me\n\n\nAs the world turns, it burns while it's spinning\nComing to a fucked-up ending\nI can't wait till the day everything in the hood is straight\nAnd I can hit the purty gates\nUntil then, the pen is unfair\nSlave ships in the middle of nowhere (ma)\nI lets my goddamn hair grow (ma)\nBellin' in court, lookin' like a scarecrow\nOn Capital Hill, they them passed a bill\nComing at me with a fucked-up deal (nah)\nThe judge gave me a 'L'\nBut y'all can't tell\nI wait and cry in my cell\nConvicted negro, superhero\nSpeaker at our house\nTakin' lyrics in my mouth\nBitches in the south showin' ass (mm)\nMix a lot, got hoes puttin titties on the glass\nWe blast in the west for example\nAnd rap about this shit over funkadelic samples\nYo' babies see me kill a fool on TV (Wilson!)\nAnd straight call me a G\n\n\nPenitentiary, I hear you calling me\nPenitentiary, I hear you calling me\nThinkin' of illegal ways to get paid\nBut it ain't shit, got to be legit\n\n\nSouth-central L.A.\nYou can buy your game from the C.I.A., hey-hey\nAnd South-central L.A.\nYou can buy your game from the C.I.A. baby\n\n\nWhen the evil outweighs the good\nAnd you only give a fuck about rucks\nThe Earth will self-destruct (Bitch)\nFuck the ozone layer, bitch I'm a playa (Bitch)\nPlus we got a black mayor\nI get sex when I shows flex (Booom!)\nPorbey Rolex (Booom!)\nWhich hoe is next? (Booom!)\nWould you like a piece of me? Not a mate\nCalling you a hoe 'cos I'm fucking on the first day (uh)\nMy world is a one-mile radius\nI swear every other hood is the shadiest (uh)\nCould the crips and bloods be all rotten\nWhen the trilateral commission is plottin'?\nWhat you gonna do when the Earth erupts?\nSome niggaz gettin' nuts outa carafel cups (punk)\nFool you on master's woe\nBut won't even think about, sucking Bob Doe (punk)\nAsshole from the Senate\nHow can you relate to a project tennant?\nMotherfuck you and not the courtman, no corrections\nTryina' get a section of this west-side connection\n\n\n\n\nJust because you gotta stay\nYou ain't gotta rot away\nWe gon' come and get you one day\n",
