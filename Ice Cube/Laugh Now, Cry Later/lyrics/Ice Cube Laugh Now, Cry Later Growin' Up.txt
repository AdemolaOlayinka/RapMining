Ice Cube
Laugh Now, Cry Later
2006)
Ha ha, that's my
Turn it up 
Uhh, yeah
I hear a beat like this, and think about growin up
House parties, with gangbangers showin up
Represent your hood, everybody throw it up
They say Cube get on the mic, blow it up
I used to lyrical, political
But now you want it sugarcoated like cereal
First I met Dre, then I met Yella (yessir)
Dr. Dre made me rap acapella
Me and Jinx did a show at Dudo's
With K-Dee, I think it was two shows
Then Dre introduced me to E
Cruisin down the street in his red Jeep
He said, yo we should flip it like this
Cause them Boyz N the Hood like the gangsta
I put the pen to the pad, young was raw
And told the world how we felt about the law
It was real
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane

Oh, it's B.W.!
Them on tour and they comin our way
Little one is still tucked away
In that trailer park, just bumpin our tape
Jerry Heller tried to make his escape
I had to bounce, while other got raped
Same turned around and said me
No you cause I'm down with Chuck D
And I'm 'bout to do a movie up, a classic
When I hit the screen, it was magic
Never thought I'd see Eazy in a casket
Thanks for everythang, that's on everythang
I learned a lot of game from you
I like your son, he got his name from you
I tell him everythang that he need to know
If he ask my advice, I won't think twice homey
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane
From Boyz N the Hood, to XXX 2
Everybody wanna know my next move
Fans all around say "We love you Cube!"
I wanna take time to say I love you too
I love all my fans cause they know I'm a man
And not a little boy or some play toy
A lot of say I grew up on you
And let me know if anybody wit you
Cause you talk a lot of about the red, black & blue
And how they treat a called Katrina, did you see her
White folks worry 'bout them misdemeanor
While black people dyin in that God dang arena
Just because I'm actin never stop rappin
It's in my blood homey, I'ma keep the party crackin
Money keep stackin 'til they put me in a casket
Who you think you wit? Here's another classic
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane
I'm Ruthless, I'm Ruthless..
Street Knowledge..
Lench Mob..
Westside..
Uhh..
I see the happiness (all day every day)
I see the pain
Where am I (growin up in the hood)
Back down memory lane
