Here's another classic\nI see the happiness (all day every day)\nI see the pain\nWhere am I (growin up in the hood)\nBack down memory lane\nI'm Ruthless, I'm Ruthless..\nStreet Knowledge..\nLench Mob..\nWestside..\nUhh..\nI see the happiness (all day every day)\nI see the pain\nWhere am I (growin up in the hood)\nBack down memory lane\n",
