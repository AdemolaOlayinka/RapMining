Point it out on a map\nDon't be scared to leave homey, we can come back\nIf you wanna come back to this bullshit\nMost of it comin straight out the pulpit\nWe got to change our ways in the hood\nUnderstand that it's AIDS in the hood...\n\nThe nigga trap...\n\n\n\n(I got a Public Pretender.. tryin to make me a winner)\n(Nigga please don't surrender.. they'll have you for dinner)\n",
