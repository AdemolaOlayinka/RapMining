You's a fuckin' vulture\nYou never approached a mic\nYou're dressed like a dyke sayin' what ya don't like\nWho deserve 5 Mics, who deserve 2\nBut the nigga with 2 still can serve you\nThis West Coast flow is different than the East\nBut it ain't no different in the street\n\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)\nI crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy\nCause the salt might make you choke\n(I'm spittin' pollaseeds) I'm spittin' pollaseeds\nI crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy\nBecause these niggas is salty they'll make you choke\nOh oh, you niggas got me fucked up\n\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds on the porch with the torch\nIn case these niggas come around to see the Porsche\nWhen I brandish, motherfuckers vanish\nThey don't understand like a nigga speakin' Spanish\nNo comprende, me no speak no Engle\nHere now yo' ass feelin' tingly\nNow you're doin' shit like Darryl Stingley\nDon't get stung by the motherfuckin' stingray\nJumpin' over niggas, y'all better king me\nPut your rap careers up on eBay\nCrazy Toones is the motherfuckin' DJ\nBaby drop to your knees, he deserves a BJ\nI got a big brother nicknamed CJ\nWhen you see him in the hood take it easy\nIf you a breezy, take him to the heezy\nDo him like Halle Berry did Michael Ealy\n\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)\nI crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy\nCause the salt might make you choke\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)\nI crack 'em one by one, cause I don't wanna be greedy\nBecause these niggas is salty they'll make you choke\nOh oh (I'm spittin' pollaseeds)\n\nQuick to twist ya, hit ya, it's the chipper\nPistol gripper, skip-skipper runnin' up in your rear-view mirror\nReady to bust with my bandanna, bumpin' oldies\nCube throw me the lob like Odom to Kobe\nSo I could bust a Crip Walk on these niggas\nYellow tape off these niggas, fuck all these salty niggas\nThey can't hold our shit\nGangsta rap ain't dead, motherfuckers just stole our shit\nAll you niggas owe us alimony\nAll you did was switch your name and ate our style up like ravioli\nOn your club raps I'm pissin', talk shit I'll knock your Comodi glasses\nOff your face under the transmission, nigga\nFrom the Westside fuckin' up the program\nWith the surplus hanky hangin' out the Brougham\nDub Sizzla, dippin' on them 'draulics and D's\nSpittin' shells at you niggas like pollaseeds\n\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds\nI crack 'em one by one cause I don't wanna be greedy\nCause the salt might make you choke\nI'm spittin' pollaseeds\nI crack 'em one by one, cause I don't wanna be greedy\nBecause these niggas is salty they'll make you choke, oh oh\n",
