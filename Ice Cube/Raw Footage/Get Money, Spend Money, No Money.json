(yes)\nYou won't believe what I'm dealin\nThis West coast shit, oh what a feelin (ah)\nNiggaz think I'm drug dealin\n'Cause I roll by with no motherfuckin ceiling (none)\nIs he worth a hundred million?\nNo need to ask Ice Cube how I'm livin (how ya livin loc?)\nI still got the recipe\nSouth Central LA is the pedigree\nDon't try to tell me what it better be\nI have your ass up in physical therapy\nA outlaw like a Cherokee\nThe rap industry tried to bury me\nBut if I died on the mic up at Larry B\nI'm so heavy you bitches couldn't carry me\n\nGet money, spend money, no money, lookin like a dummy\n(I really don't give a fuck)\nYour money ain't my fuckin money, got a pocket full of money\n(Come on homie throw it up)\n\nI don't accept no disrespect\nOnly thing I expect is self check\nJust grin and bare it\nGot an ass whoopin that your ass don't wanna inherit\nMost rappers are parrots\nThey say what they told to say, to get a neck full of carrots/karats\nGot your mama embarrassed\nHow long 'fore they callin us terrorists? Nigga, I'm serious\nI, keep it gangsta but I keeps a job\n'Cause it's, hard to sleep when you steal and rob\nAnd ya, got to run here comes the blob\n'Cause, Uncle Sam is like part of the Mob\nBreak your self he'll take your wealth\nDon't get it twisted, you a motherfuckin elf\nAnd Santa Claus will go for self\nAll you got is your balls and your health\n\n\nNiggaz brag about what they got\nBut we don't own a skyscraper, now that's paper (now that's paper)\nOne generation from slums\nHappy for these little crumbs, you little bums\nWe saw you pull up but nigga shut up (shut up)\nYou always talkin about a fuckin car or truck\nYou always talkin about some fuckin rims or interior\nThat kind of shit'll keep our ass inferior\nI'm tryin to eat tomorrow\nAin't tryin to hear about the little bitty shit you bought\nSaw your little bitty house on \"Cribs\"\nWhere you fuck your wife and feed your kids (uh uh)\nNigga be quiet, ain't shit private\nEverything for sale, you can buy it\nAll this self snitchin, all this self tellin\nMotherfuckers goin back to the watermelon\n",
