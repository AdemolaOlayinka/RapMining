That shit never come\nI know it sounds strange but today is never done\nI'm up in the Range when the clock strikes 1\nWhile y'all countin sheep, I'm countin Benja-mons\nUp on my feet at the break of the sun\nPresident of the Gangster Na-tion\nWe don't go to war, we go to the store\nWe rob from the rich, and give to the poor\nHip-Hop, oh what a bore\nLettin college motherfuckers run the front door\n(Fuck that!) Let's take it back to the streets\nDon't let Viacom, dictate the heat\nThe nerve of them, I never heard of dem\nAskin me about, my urban spins\nAnd if I got about, a thousand of them\nI'm a crate MC, accordin to them\nFuck that!\n\n\n\n\nAll hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard\nThe West coast warlord, the future is today\nGet your grind on mayne, get your grind on mayne, get your grind on\n",
