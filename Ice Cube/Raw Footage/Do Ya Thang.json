Pour a nigga a lil' drink!\nThat's how it's goin' down out here in California\nListen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!\n\n\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the flyest one of all?\n\n\nNow pull in the parking lot\nNigga, find a parking spot\nFired up, everyone want to spark a lot\nPuff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.\nLookin' for a big fat ass to harass!\nIs it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'\nWhen we roll by, pussy still cookin'\nFreaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars\nIf you don't like my face - bitch, look at my car!\nKeep it simple, I told you once befo'\nIt really don't matter how I get you to the mo'\nIt really don't matter how I get you in my low\nJust hop in, let's go\nAnd let your friends know!\n\n\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the flyest one of all?\n\n\nDo ya thang, girl!\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nWe the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat\nWest Coast, baby - with so much gravy\nYou should call The Navy, ever since the 80's\nI've been doin' good, they been doin' bad\nWhen I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that\nBut never chase it, my game is so basic\nAs soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?\nJust face it, put me to the test\nIce Cube would ace it, I'm built for success\nFuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star\nIn the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)\nYou make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's\nAnd we get lap-dance from nuns\nThey put away they crucifix\nAnd they say, \"Ice Cube - boy, you the shit!\"\n\n\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the flyest one of all?\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the flyest one of all?\n\n\nI see you lookin' at me\nWe don't give a fuck!\nWhat you lookin' at?\nWe gonna give it up!\n\n\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nMirror, mirror, on the wall\nWho is the flyest one of all?\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\nDo ya thang, mayne\nFuck what they lookin' at!\n",
