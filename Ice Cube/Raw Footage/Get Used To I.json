(Ice Cube) Nigga you better know it\nIt's the Don Dadda Jr. slash motherfuckin' poet\nSit back and take notes while I spin like hundred spokes\nMy flow is razor sharp, I'm comin' straight for your throat\nWith that West Coast, gangbang, watch him when his chain hang\nEast Coast, Down South, niggaz do the same thang\nThrow up your dubs like Wu-Tang, who bang\nharder than that nigga bailin' through your hood with two chains\nSwangin' like his nuts, 'cause he don't give a fuck\nBout no nigga that ain't bangin' in no khakis or some Chuck's\nIt's that Westside, Connect'd with that nigga who flow so wreckless\nHe spent a hundred thousand on his necklace, I'll bet this\nmotherfuckin' Coast ain't got shit after me\nAin't have shit before Cube except a W.C.\nThe Maad Circle is back, with mad purple in fact\nI'm bout to join the Lench Mob, that's me squirtin' the mac, motherfuckers\n\n\nAnd y'all better get use to it\nAnd y'all better get use to it\nAnd y'all better get use to it\nAnd y'all better get use to it\n",
