Y'all know what I represent\nThe only rapper who wanna fistfight the President!\n\n\nIt take a nation of niggaz to hold us back\n\n\nWhen I bang this is dangerous, niggaz go brainless\nSo bang this with the fo'-five stainless\nAnd understand that you lookin at the famous\nWest coast rapper, who act like a anus\nHollywood! They thought they could tame this\npitbull, but I know what the game is\nThem fuckers cheat like a NBA ref\nIf you smoke one they'll electrocute you to death\nI got God on my intellect, Godzilla on my neck\nWhen a nigga come through, who you wanna holla at\nGhostriders hit the deck, when your boy got a tec\nWhere the fuck is, Afrika, Bambaataa at?\nWe need to take it back, fuck Viacom\nClear Clear Channel, and Radio One\nYou motherfuckers programmed by the programmers\nThat's why you gettin locked up by the do' slammers\nNot me!\n\n\n\n\nThey music so fluffy, I'ma stay gutter\nThat shit is kind of popcorn, my shit is so butter\nMy style never change, in 22 summers\nStraight independent, and doin my numbers\nThis ship don't sail, you know I'm still paid\nSo sourpuss niggaz, can drink lemonade\nI'm doin it for the love, you doin it because\nyou need that advancement to spend on them dubs\nI don't need a penny, but I need many\nDon't worry about my money boy cause I got plenty\nYou muh'fuckers worry about flossin so much\nYou don't know the fundamentals you forgot how to brush!\nThese 32 teeth, will give yo' ass grief\nBite you like a Fatburger if you got beef\nSo who's it gon' be? Your favorite MC\nYou scared of the government they scared of me\nNow what?\n\n\nIt take a nation of niggaz and streets of crack\n",
