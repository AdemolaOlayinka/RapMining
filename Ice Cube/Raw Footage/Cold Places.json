Tell me how you do it\nHow you get through it and them other niggaz blew it\"\nI keep my eye on the prize then pursue it\nChase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it\nSo self-educate, nigga don't hate\nCause the game I got, is Madden oh-eight\nFuck with Cube, I'm better than YouTube\nFuck with them dudes them niggaz is new school\nThe game don't change just the players\nThe rhymes don't change just the fuckin rhymesayers\n(Hahahaha!) They make it up as they go along\nBut I'm goin on 25 years strong\nThe shit I say might get you through the day\nOr change your whole life, in a major way\nThe shit they say, might catch you a case\nThe shit I say, feel like your birthday\n\n\n\n\nYou know what? Momma said it'd be days like this\nStraight hell on earth, but come up out the abyss\nShe said \"Don't let 'em see you crawl, don't let 'em see you fall\nAll they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers\"\nIt's a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket\nIf it's another hustle out there I'ma crack it\nFuck the new dance I'ma learn how to eat\nGet my mind right, stay up out these fuckin streets\nThey keep callin me\nThey keep callin, all the lil' homies keep fallin\nIn them same traps niggaz cain't figure out\nIn the fast lane boy but the bridge is out\nMake my blood boil, get yo' life spoiled\nGet you in the system, get you in the soil\nAnd your funeral was sponsored by Unocal\nSaw you UVN, nigga digital\n\n\n\n\nI know, it's fucked up how they do us\nPretend they really care, but then they Jerry Lewis\nTake that money that was allocated to us\nPut us in some fucked up trailers then sue us\nWatchin Katrina, is worser than Ike & Tina\nSee New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA\nLouisiana got racist-ass politics\nFree the Jena Six (NIGGA FREE THE JENA SIX~!)\nYour honor, Osama, Obama\nEven, yo' momma, ain't fuckin with my comments\nThey want us to quit, forget\nAnd not give a shit about these sick-ass politics\nA lunatic is in the White House\nMake me wanna go do a lick right now\nBut they'll make a nigga bow down\nin the penitentiary, a billion dollar industry\n\n\n\n\nI believe that, homey I believe that\nIf I can picture that, I'll bring a picture back\n",
