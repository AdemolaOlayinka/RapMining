Simpson)\nLeave this field, leave this prison, tell you motherfuckers where to kiss 'em\nI wanna be all broke up, movin' all old and slow\nI wanna be a alcoholic just like Broadway Joe\nI wanna be a sideshow, kinda like Iron Mike\nUsed to have a few Bentleys, now I just ride a bike\n\n\nIf you don't wanna shake that hood mentality\nHow the fuck we supposed to change our reality?\nIf you don't wanna shake that hood mentality\nHow the fuck we supposed to change our reality?\n\n\nFuck school nigga, they ain't tryin' to educate me\nAll they give a fuck is what I memorized lately\nI'm gon' have to teach myself, clock that money, get that wealth\nI wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fuckin' elf\nNo kid left behind but he get the run-around\nCan't you motherfuckers see that they tryin' to dumb us down?\nDon't trust the government, President is for sale\nHe don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well\nSell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell\nDo I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?\nGo kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail\nI'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale\nYou can go be a pimp, you can go be a hoe\nBut you only gon' get paid off what you know\nIf you don't know shit, then you can't work for me\nCause you read your first book in the penitentiary\n\n\nIf you don't wanna shake that hood mentality\nHow the fuck we supposed to change our reality?\nIf you don't wanna shake that hood mentality\nHow the fuck we supposed to change our reality?\n",
