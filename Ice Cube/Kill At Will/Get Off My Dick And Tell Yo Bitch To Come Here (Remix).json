Jockin ain't healthy\nCause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy?\nWith juice, so I see you try to run behind\nBut I'ma tell you punk, you gets none of mine\nCause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool\nby the niggaz who terrorized the old school\nSo don't try me or buy me a beer\nJust stay off my dick nigga\n",
