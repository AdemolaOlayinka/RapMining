You say, \"Hell no!\"\nA black woman is my manager, not in the kitchen\nSo could you please stop bitchin?\n\n\"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots\"\nYeah, yeah..\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots\"\nYeah, yeah..\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n..\n\n\n\nYou missed, and didn't hit Da Lench Mob either\n\"Guerillas in the Mist..\" without Jungle Fever\nBut I got the fever for the flava of a cracker\nNot a Pringle, bust the single, here's my new jingle\n\"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots\"\nThe KKK has got three-piece suits\nUsing niggaz like turkey shoots\nMy motto is +Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute+\nNow if I say no violence, devil, you won't respect mine\nFuck the dumb shit - and get my Tec-9\nAnd if they approach us\nA-ight, a-ight - I bury those cockroaches\nAnd if you can't deal with my +Kill at Will+\nHere's a new gift to get - try my +Death Certificate+\n+Amerikkka's Most+, Amerikkka's burnt - it's like toast\nLike Jordan, I'm goin coast to coast\nDribblin the funk here comes the nigga\nwith the motherfuckin monster dunk, get off me punk!\n\"Jordan.. watch Jordan,\naiyyo yo watch Jordan .. YES!\"\n\"You better eat your Wheaties\"\n\n\"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots\"\nYeah, yeah..\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\"Stalkin.. walkin in my big black boots\"\nYeah, yeah..\n\"But when will they shoot?\"\n\n\nDarryl Gates got the studio surrounded\nCause he don't like the niggaz that I'm down with\nMotherfucker wanna do us\nCause I like Nat, Huey, Malcolm, and Louis\nMost got done by a black man's bullet\nGive a trigger to a nigga and watch him pull it\nNegro assass-in\nI'ma dig a ditch, bitch, and throw yo' ass in\nWhen they shoot, no, it won't be a cracker\nThey use somebody much blacker\nWhat I do? I called up the Geto Boy(s) crew\nCause +My Mind's Playing Tricks On Me+ too\nNever died, surround my crib\nand F.O.I. makin sure nobody creep when I sleep\nKeep a 9 millimeter in my Jeep - PEEP!\nWhen I roll, I gots to roll deep\nAin't goin out cheap\nMet the MADD Circle on Cypress Hill cause it's so steep\nThey'll never get me, they'll never hit me\nMotherfuck that shit J-Dee\nNow I'm relaxed\nGrab the St. Ide's brew so I can max\nSittin by the window cause it's so fuckin hot\nand then I heard a shot - boom.\n",
