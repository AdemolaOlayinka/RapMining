There was a robbery and the nigger looked just like you. Now\nget out of the car with your hands up and legs spread.)\nStarted they investigation\nno driver's liscence no registration\nWhen I stepped out the car they slammed me\ngoddamn ya'll who got the camera?\n\n\nOh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit\nOh please, oh please, oh please, just gimme just one more hit\nwho got the camera?\n\n\n\n\nNo lights no camera no action\nand the pigs wouldn't believe that my slave name was Jackson\nHe said don't lie to me\nI'm lookin for John, Matt, or Spike Lee\nThe motherfucker called for back up\nI guess they planned to beat the mack up\nHe called me a silly ass thug\nand pulled out his billy ass club\nTearin up my coupe lookin for the chronic\ngoddamn nobody got a panasonic\nFound an empty can of old gold\ncame around and put my ass in a choke hold\nFucked around and broke my pager\nthen they hit a nigga with the tazer\nthe motherfucking pigs were tryin to hurt me\nI fell to the floor and yelled lord have mercy\nThen they hit me in the face ya'll\nbut to them it ain't nuttin but (a friendly game of base ball)\nCrowd stood around I said goddamn ya\nWho got the camera\n\n\n\n\n\nI knew when I saw that deputy smirkin'\nthat they were gonna put some work in\nMr. law had to hit me in the jaw\ncause I called them faggots with guns and badges\nThey played rat-a-tat-tat on me head\nbut if I had the gatty-gat-gat they'd be dead\nA victim of a big fat 187\nand little devils don't go to heaven\nLast night there were eleven but they were'nt scarin me\nso they tried the flashlight therapy\nI looked at the black one and called him a traitor\nI don't give a fuck if you got a beta\nJust take my fuckin picture\nso I can go downtown and bitch and pitch ya (?)\nThe one that called me a spook\nhis name is officer David Duke\nIf the crowd weren't around they would've shot me\ntried to play me out like my name was rodney\nFuckin police gettin badder\nbut if I had a camera the shit wouldn't matter\n(bitch), uh who got my nine, who got my nine\nYa'll done did it this time, uh\nwho the fuck got my nine\n",
