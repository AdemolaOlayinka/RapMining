Riots, melees and disturbances of the peace are against the\ninterests of all our people and therefore cannot be permitted)\n(The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty....)\n(We've been told that all along Crenshaw Boulevard that there's a series of\nfires. A lot of looting is going on. A disaster area obviously)\n(The jury found that they were all not guilty, not guilty...)\nMake it rough\n(A lot of activity continues here in this....) Make it rough\n(We have sporadic fires throughout the city of Los Angeles)\n\n\n\nNot guilty the filthy devils tried ta kill me\nWhen the news get to the hood then niggas will be\nhotter than cayenne pepper, cuss, bust\nKickin up dust is a must\nI can't trust a cracker in a blue uniform\nStick a nigga like a unicorn\nVaugn, wicked, Lawrence Powell, foul\nCut his fuckin throat and I smile\nGo to Simi Valley and surely\nsomebody knows the address of the jury\nPay a little visit, \"Who is it?\" (Who is Ice Cube?)\n\"Can I talk to the grand wizard?\" then boom\nMake him eat the barrel, modern day feral\nNow he's zipped up like leather tuscadero\nPretty soon we'll catch Sergeant Coon\nShoot him in the face, run up in him witta broom\nStick prick, devils ain't shit\nIntroduce his ass to the AK40 dick\nTwo dazed niggas layin in the cut\nTo get some respect we had to tear this muthafucka up\n\nMake it rough\n\n\n\nI gotta Mac10 for Officer Wynd\nDamn, his devil ass need to be shipped back to Kansas\nin a casket, crew cut faggot\nNow he ain't nothin but food for the maggots\nLunch, punch, Hawaiin lyin\nNiggas ain't buyin\nya story bore me\nTaerin up shit with fire, shooters, looters\nNow I got a lap-top computer\nI told you all what happened and you heard it, read it\nbut all you could call me was anti-Semitic\nRegret it-nope, said it-yep\nListen to my big black boots as I step\nNiggas had to break you off somethin, give Bush a push\nBut your National Guard ain't hard\nYou had to get Rodney to stop me cos you know what?\nWe woulda teared this muthafucka up\n\nHuh, make it rough!\nHuh Muggs, make it rough!\n\n\n\nIt's on, gone with the wind and I know white men can't dunk\nNow I'm stealin blunts\nAnd it came from Betty Crocker, overweight and blacker\nDon't fuck with the black-owned stores but hit the Foot Lockers\nSteal, muthafuck Fire Marshall Bill\nOh what the hell, throw the cocktail\nI smelt smoke, got the fuck out, Ice Cube lucked out\nMy nigga had his truck out, didn't get stuck out\nIn front of that store with the Nikes and Adidas\nOh Jesus, I ?? Surplus got the heaters\nMeet us so we can get the 9's and the what-nots\nGot the Mossberg with the double eyed buckshot\nReady for Darryl and like Beretta wouldn't say\nKeep your eye on the barrel, a sparrow\nDon't do the crime if you can't do the time\nBut I'm rollin so that's a fucked up slogan\nThe Hogan's Heroes spotted the gorilla by the Sizzler\nHittin up police killer\nThe super duper nigga that'll buck\nWe had to tear this muthafucka up so what the fuck!?!\n\nHuh, make it rough!\nYo Muggs, make it rough\nHuh, make it rough\nEnough\n\n\n\n(Not Guilty verdicts for Stacey Coon, Lawrence Powell, Timothy Wynd and\nTheodore Vaugsinio, the four officers accused of beating motorist Rodney\nKing)\n",
