Get it right?\nMy momma think I'm outta sight, outta sight\nIt is what it is, it is, it is\nI do this for my kids, my kids, my kids\n(Understand me!)\nNow homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?\nIt is what it is, it is, is is\nI do this for my kids, my kids, my kids\nNow will I ever get it right? Get it right?\nEven though I'm out at night, livin life\nGirl I'm tryin to make this money, I ain't even playin\nCourse the game I'm in, it ain't even payin\nWhen I'm on the go, on the go\nEverybody wanna know, wanna know\nCube where the fuck you goin, each and every day?\nI just turn around, and I say\n\nIt is what it is, it is, it is\nI do this for my kids, my kids, my kids\nNow homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?\nIt is what it is, it is, is is\nI do this for my kids, my kids, my kids\nEven though I'm messin up, messin up (you fuckin up)\nFeel the devil catchin up, catchin up\nI put it in the Lord's hands, he is the man\nPlease his demands 'fore he turn me into sand (don't do it)\nBut got to pay the rent, pay the rent\nWithout the government, government\nI do it for the fuck of it, fuck of it\n\n\nGot to get my swagger up\nPlease get yo' swagger up\nGot to get my swagger up\nBetter get my swagger up\n\nCheck this out homey\nThis business right here, is personal\nI would go around you, over you, under you or THROUGH you\nto make sure none of my family suffer\nDo you understand me?!\n",
