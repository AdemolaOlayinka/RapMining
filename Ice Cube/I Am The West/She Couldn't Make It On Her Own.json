(my barrel...)\nAll you artists walkin' 'round with yo' wack raps (wack raps!)\nThey gettin' fucked by the game - Kat Stacks! (Kat Stacks!)\nAnd any nigga thinkin' he can make it happen\nI'll be outside of Staples with the bitches and phantom. - Muhfucka!\nPull up on them bitches, steppin' out on 30\" inches\nIn my L.A. Dodger fitted, with some Louie V. stichin'.\nNiggas wanna catch me slippin'. Yeah; they prayin' and they wishin'\nCause a nigga clockin dough - and I'm fuckin' all they bitches!\n(\"Yo! You fuckin' all they bitches? \") Yeah, I'm fuckin' all they bitches!\nIf it's money over bitches, then I'm preachin' my religion.\nCause this game that I'm livin', 'bout as cold as my wrist is\nIf you know my paps; then you know I'm 'bout the business! (business!)\nSmoke big trees! (big trees!) - Christmas! (Christmas!)\nMy flow retarded nigga! (my flow retarted nigga!) - Gifted! (gifted!)\nThis games' a bitch! - Watch me pimp it!\nShe had to get the pimp,\nShe couldn't make it on her own!\nShe had to get the pimp,\nShe couldn't make it on her own! (She had to!)\nShe had to get the pimp,\nShe couldn't make it on her own!\nShe had to get the pimp,\nShe couldn't make it on her own! (What about me?)\nIf you don't - kick it with' me - who you gon' - kick it with'?! (kick it with'!)\nIce Cube - is the shit! - Who you been - speakin' with'? (speakin' with'!)\nThey been - lyin' to you, if they told you diff-er-ent, (diff-er-ent!)\nI got - a diff-er-ent - cool type of tempera-ment. (tempera-ment!)\nWestCoast style, baby; on some California shit. (California shit!)\nThey - might've told ya that - I was hard on the bitch (on the bitch!)\nYou - know - how it go - some bitches think they slick (think they slick!)\nLook at me and - think they about to get rich. (get rich!)\nUh-ohh! (uh-ohh!) - Danger! (danger!)\nYou are (you are!) - a stranger! (a stranger!)\nWho am I? - I am - the long ranger.\nTonto tell em'. I'll run yo fuckin' ass through the ringer. - It goes...\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?\n",
