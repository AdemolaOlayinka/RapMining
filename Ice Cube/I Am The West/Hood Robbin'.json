The first hit ain't free\nI know you're bout to die, but let me see your ID\nI know you're bout to lie, but can ya pay this fee?\nIf you can't pay, then please have a seat\nYou can't see a doctor, but you can see a priest\nWe can't save ya life 'til we got some insurance\nYour premium is paid, at that assurance\nI hope ya got endurance\nThey got me on hold, and I'm under the influence\nNurse high as a kite, in charge with my life\nAnd everything is lost, without Blue-Cross\n\nYou know, I heard they hood robbin\nYour money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em\nYou know, I heard they hood robbin\nYour money or your life, and it ain't no stoppin 'em\nAin't that a bitch?\nWhen you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?\nAin't that a bitch?\nWhen you got to steal from the poor, and give to the rich?\n\nWhatever you need, we got it for cheap right here baby\nThis America, it ain't gon' cost ya nothin...\nBut a arm and a leg... maybe one of them motherfuckin ears, haha\nDon't trip, just put in on ya credit card...\nPut it in ya baby' name, haha\n",
