    "lyrics": "This is poetry in motion\nTry to catch on, stay close to the host\nand MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin\nLadies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion\nHit spots soothin, can't stop movin\nGo ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin\nWhen I detain it's a brainstorm\nnever the same form, every brain I rained on is warm\nTakin a trip through Memory Lane to Melody\nSee if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's\ncould do you justice, but you can't touch this\nSome kid just tried to bust this but he just missed\nI'm universal and much more merciful\nSo versatile with the style it's reversable\nI get away even if I say a curse or two\nFirst, let me bust another verse for you\nYour arms too short to box with Ra so quit\nYou don't want no kind of conflict\nOr you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped\nPick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip\nEverything I said flows since my intro\nI plant a thought extend and then grow\nHoldin my pen tightly it might be\nControversy at first when I write the\nchords of research don't just take it for granted\nWhen I'm gone my mind remains a planet\nIf I keep buildin, and teach the children\nSo when they read in between the lines it's filled in\nI break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate\ntill I'm deep awake, but not asleep\nAt the same time risin and advertisin\nwhat is true, keep advised and you can stay wise\nand I'm untouchable\n\nComin over the bridge take a peak at the skyline\nCause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme\nMy culture's makin me stronger, mentally\nPhysically I'm powerful poetry now that could be\nlabelled as art placed in a museum\nStyle'll make scenery, now you see 'em\nExhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with\nnothin illiterate it's facts I build with\nMy mind's untouchable which means intangible\nContents never dense it's understandable\nI study life so I can live it the right way\nNo time to hear what another brother might say\nWhy sell a capsule of crack I don't have to\nI rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to\nput message on records that's graced with hard bass\nSmugglin microphones, this ain't Scarface\nWhoever talked that talk, I wanna hawk\nAnd don't try to Escape From New York\nCross a 110th Street lookin for a problem\nIt's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em\nI hear the music clear as I get near\nthe hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater\nTake a step back when I rap I step up to you...\nI'm untouchable\n\nPut on my thinking cap pump the track\nTest your reflex relax but in contact\nyou fold and lose control so hold your partner closer\nyou're supposed to keep your composure\nBut you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype\nit's like nitro opponents get petro\nRemember the trademark left by the R\nthat's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest\nin effect, you could die-tect the imposter\nTakin my props, Rakim is still proper\nI'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it\nEverything I say, coincide with the topic\nThoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured\nInside my brain it's all manufactured\nAs we go deeper it's hard to find\nDon't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind\nIt's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined\nin the mind with some kind of idea for\nthe style I'm advertisin what is true\nKeep advised that you stay wise and the mind\nis untouchable\n",
