Eric B. & Rakim
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em
1990)
This is poetry in motion
Try to catch on, stay close to the host
and MC's try to make the road rough but I'm coastin
Ladies hear the rhymes rub em on like lotion
Hit spots soothin, can't stop movin
Go ahead bust a sweat and you can bet I'm still coolin
When I detain it's a brainstorm
never the same form, every brain I rained on is warm
Takin a trip through Memory Lane to Melody
See if you could tell if these thoughts to fell MC's
could do you justice, but you can't touch this
Some kid just tried to bust this but he just missed
I'm universal and much more merciful
So versatile with the style it's reversable
I get away even if I say a curse or two
First, let me bust another verse for you
Your arms too short to box with Ra so quit
You don't want no kind of conflict
Or you'll get stripped as the rhyme is ripped
Pick up the pieces now ain't that peace yeah I'm hip
Everything I said flows since my intro
I plant a thought extend and then grow
Holdin my pen tightly it might be
Controversy at first when I write the
chords of research don't just take it for granted
When I'm gone my mind remains a planet
If I keep buildin, and teach the children
So when they read in between the lines it's filled in
I break to meditate, not a peep, concentrate
till I'm deep awake, but not asleep
At the same time risin and advertisin
what is true, keep advised and you can stay wise
and I'm untouchable

Comin over the bridge take a peak at the skyline
Cause that's how I shine not only when I rhyme
My culture's makin me stronger, mentally
Physically I'm powerful poetry now that could be
labelled as art placed in a museum
Style'll make scenery, now you see 'em
Exhibit a knowledge that's packed and filled with
nothin illiterate it's facts I build with
My mind's untouchable which means intangible
Contents never dense it's understandable
I study life so I can live it the right way
No time to hear what another brother might say
Why sell a capsule of crack I don't have to
I rhyme and sign million dollar contracts to
put message on records that's graced with hard bass
Smugglin microphones, this ain't Scarface
Whoever talked that talk, I wanna hawk
And don't try to Escape From New York
Cross a 110th Street lookin for a problem
It's Hell Up In Harlem, watch Ra solve em
I hear the music clear as I get near
the hundred and twenty fifth street Apollo Theater
Take a step back when I rap I step up to you...
I'm untouchable

Put on my thinking cap pump the track
Test your reflex relax but in contact
you fold and lose control so hold your partner closer
you're supposed to keep your composure
But you hear the drum said go then it gets so hype
it's like nitro opponents get petro
Remember the trademark left by the R
that's never soft or smooth it's comin off the hardest
in effect, you could die-tect the imposter
Takin my props, Rakim is still proper
I'm a prophet, you can't stop it, when I drop it
Everything I say, coincide with the topic
Thoughts bounce around till my skull is fractured
Inside my brain it's all manufactured
As we go deeper it's hard to find
Don't even think about it, cause you can't read my mind
It's clear so therefore you need a ear or inclined
in the mind with some kind of idea for
the style I'm advertisin what is true
Keep advised that you stay wise and the mind
is untouchable
