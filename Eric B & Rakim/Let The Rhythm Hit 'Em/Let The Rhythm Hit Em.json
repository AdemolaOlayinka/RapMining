    "lyrics": "I'm the arsenal\nI got artillery, lyrics of ammo\nRounds of rhythm\nThen I'm 'a give 'em piano\nBring a bullet-proof vest\nNothin' to ricochet\nready to aim at the brain\n~Now what the trigger say\nTempos triflin'\nFelt like a rifle\nMassage 'n' melodies\nMight go right through\nSimultaneously like an Uzi\nNothin' can bruise me\nLyrics let up when lady say don't lose me\nSo re-load quickly\nAnd you better hit me\nWhile I'm lettin' this fifi get wit me\nYou steppin' with .007\nBetter make it snappy\nNo time to do your hair, baby\nBrothers are bustin' at me\nBeats and bullets pass me\nNone on target\nThey want the R hit\nBut wtch the god get\nQuicker, the tongue is the trigger\n'Cause I'm real fast\nLet off some rhythm at 'em\nLet 'em feel the blast\nPenetrate at a crazy rate\nThis ain't no .38\nHit 'em at point blank range\nAnd watch 'em radiate\nRunnin' out of ammunition\nI'm done wit' em\nYou ask me how I did 'em\nI let the rhythm hit 'em\nI push a power that's punishable\nBetter be a prisoner\nThe hit man is the\nBrother wit' charisma\nShowing you that I have\nPowerful paragraphs\nFollowers will become leaders\nBut without a path\nYa mentally paralyzed\nCrippled ya third eye\nRhymes are blurred\nThen it occurred that you heard I\nReduced the friction with crucifixion\nLet loose the mix then\nBoost the piston\nEric hit 'em with' some of that\nCut like a lumberjack\nAnd me gettin' hit back\nIt won't be none of that\nI'm untouchable\nYou see me in 3-D\nWhen I let the rhythm hit another M.C.\nLyrics made of lead\nEnters your head\nThen eruptions of a mass production\nWill spread when\nMusic is louder\nFull of gunpower\nMicrophone machinery\nWhen I see a crowd of\nParty people pumpin'\nTheir fist like this\nYa hide in the back\nThinkin' that I might miss\nBut the R is accurate\nPlus I'm packed up with\nEducated punch lines that\nI have to hit\nWhatever I aim at\nI line 'em up\nYa body is weak, feel with pain\nThat time is up\nYou been hit with somethin'\nDifferent, isn't it?\nRakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent\nNothin' can harm me\nWhy try to bar me\nYou couldn't come around THE RA with aN army\nYou'll get wrecked by the architect\nSo respect 'em\nI disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em\nWith radiation\nPut 'em by the basement\nBust his chest open\nBash his face in\nLet it split 'im\nSince he brought his main man wit' 'im\nHe ask me how I did 'im\nI let the rhythm hit 'im\nLet it hit 'im\nDance floor's dangerous\nPacked in like a briefcase\nRhyth with ral rough rhyme\nBeats with deep bass\nGirls with tight pants\nMaybe they might dance\nTonight if the Rs on the mike\nThere's a slight chance\nThe crowd is crucial\nM.C.'s grounds are neutral\nNow that you're here let me introduce you\nGet ready\nI'm hard read like graffiti but steady\nScience I drop is real heavy\nRadiant energy, that'll be the penalty\nTouch the third rail on the pain of remedy\nThe prescription's one every hour\nNow it's a HABIT\nYa need another hit from the freestyle fanatic\nAttention: follow directions real close\nKeep out of reach of children\nBeware of overdose\nToo many milligram\nNO ONE made a iller jam\nMy rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts\nThat kill a man\nIdeas for the ear to fear\nMight split 'im\nHe'll never forget 'im\nHe'll rest in peace wit' 'em\nAt least when he left he'll know what hit 'im\nThe last breath of the words of death\nWas the rhythm\nNow throw you hands in the air and yo, go\nRakim will do the rest of this slow\nIf I speed they know you'll blow the hell up\nIf I slow up, THEY'LL catch up, hell no\nWicked as I kicked it\nDon't need to remix it\n'Cause I prefixed it\nReversed and switched it\nTo perform to perfection\nSection for section\nRhymes keep connectin'\nYa guessin' what's next an'\nBlood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it\nYa hit the ground burnin' and woke up frostbit'\n'Cause when I explained ya can't complain for pain\nTravel through the brain hit a vein\nThen remain, let it radiate\nVibes will vibrate\nWhy did you violate\nNow I'm 'a have to let the style brak\nMoans now the tone is ingrown\nAfter this here's thrown, gimme another microphone\nBefore I get that fifi I met\nWhisper I wanna reach her intellect\nKiss her 'cause I wanna give her the most respect\nSo I shine and let the write reflect\nHold 'er, mold 'er, make 'er feel older\nLay her on my shoulder\nEverything I told her\nMakes her feel secure whenever I'm wit' 'er\nAnd you know how I did 'er\nMe and the rhythm hit 'er\n",
