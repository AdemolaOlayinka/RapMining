Like...\nOnce a day, girl, truly\nWe grew up with her through the lens of a camera\nDidn't have much, but dare said I'm having her\nShorty was the joint, here's my case and point\nMe and 'Pac rollin' L's in the trailer\nBoth of us get to scheming how to nail her\nFirst movie about to come out in the theater\nPleasure principle, butt to the makeup truck, so ill I gave her my code\nWe kissed, I took her control, we swapped as all the film rolled\nA marathon, we kept this good thing going, sunset, the moon, it came on\nIn my mind it would prolong\nListen, the scene was deaded, but I wanted my own edit\nMe and Justice kissing keep it going, two pros with credit\nA memorable summer in '92 out in Cali\nWhen I got back up top my niggas asked about the fatty\nAnd did I smash her madly, to that I had to answer\nNegative, but I'd give anything to be her dancer\nA captivating lady, I used to be her baby\nGood Times, they never fading\nLook back and celebrate Poetic Justice\n\nAt any time, and any place, I don't care who's around\nAt any time, and any place, I don't care who's around\nIn the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes\nI can feel your hand moving up my thighs\nIn the thunder and rain, you stare into my eyes\nI can feel your hand moving up my thighs\n",
