'Cause I ain't takin' no pills\n\n\nIt's Busta Buss in the place\nAnd I ain't got no worries\n'Cause I'm bustin' all in her face\n'Til her vision start to get blurry\nYeah, see me 'bout to get straight to it\nAnd we getting to this shit early\nOh man, oh Lord, of his mercy\nSee the way we got 'em all thirsty\nBitch come and ride with me on this journey\nCome and straddle on my beef jerky\nI'm a make her sweat, the more we get dirty\nBitch had a perm but now her shit curly\nIt's Young Money right here\nIt's The Conglomerate right here\nSee all this bread that I'm a peel off\nWhen I get to buyin' everything up in here\nShit getting' hot and gettin' all humid\nPoppin' that molly, actin' all stupid\nWhen they ask who the nicest in the circle\nDon't be mad 'cause your name ain't included\nIf you need water flow be like fluids\nSee the way we comin' in suited and booted\nWhen I finish with 'em I leave 'em all wounded\nBitch you ain't knowin' my Level Five mutant\nSee how this shit is really going\nActing like they ain't knowing\nGot a nigga really digging in they pocket\nAnd every time I ask they open and closin'\nLook I hope you know what the fuck, what this shit is\nWhen I dig in your stomach and you curse me\nGo ahead and angle the pussy a whole other way\nI ain't got no worries, biatch!\n",
