I wanna see you do that thing
Before you all pass out, pass out
Hands up, hands up
Spazz out, spazz out
Nobody could do it the way we get it down nah ah
We make ‘em blow their cash out cash out
Don’t you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor till it’s filled out the glass (non-stop)
Either way we got it on snag
We don’t stop until we bounce like hum
We ain’t stop til we knock off your block
Molly watch the flyest nigga with it purposely, I sloply nob
Some will break the square, would be getting Monopoly guap
Several in beautiful cities, that property hop
Most you niggas need to probably stop
Create a lane cuz when I come through most you’d do is probably flop
When speak chances of 3 shots, I probably pop
Shots legal til they nosils is hot, I’m to the spot
Now you knew Rihanna for him (I be the heat)
And we gotta put it on him (you see him in the street)
Let’s go. Avatar, shit I’m lost in the zone
Might as well give me the crown bitch, I’m bringing it home
Try to hell I hit the sand bitch, I’m standin’ alone
See I be like a katana til they bandage your bones
Why you niggas quit the block and left the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what’s legendary
I wanna see you do that thing
Before you all pass out, pass out
Hands up, hands up
Spazz out, spazz out
Nobody could do it the way we get it down nah ah
We make ‘em blow their cash out cash out
Don’t you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor till it’s filled out the glass (non-stop)
Either way we got it on snag
We don’t stop until we bounce like hum
I’m comin’ and killin’ and causin’ you niggas to lose it
While a man took a challenge, this line that I’m smakin’ I’m stupid
Assaultin’ bad, I be the booth boy, love to abuse it
You see the high bean when I’m comin’ motherfucker, move it
And so by side
You know we got that shit
We give it to him til we makin’ a nigga say “I got it, bitch”
And uh we don’t stop, and uh we don’t quit
And uh they see nose flips because we drop their nose heads
I know for Moses harder to stomach
God had to spit enough flesh in, what he do to become it
I step in the building, demolish shit, you know how I got it
The way a man showin’ everything and o arguin’ it
My hundred fifty thousand dollar feature might swallow your budget
And fuck the hood up boy and see how they love it
Why you niggas quit the block and left the shit that we bring?
Bust bottles and salute what’s legendary
I wanna see you do that thing
Before you all pass out, pass out
Hands up, hands up
Spazz out, spazz out
Nobody could do it the way we get it down nah ah
We make ‘em blow their cash out cash out
Don’t you love it when we come and do it again?
Pour liquor till it’s filled out the glass (non-stop)
Either way we got it on snag
We don’t stop until we bounce like hum
