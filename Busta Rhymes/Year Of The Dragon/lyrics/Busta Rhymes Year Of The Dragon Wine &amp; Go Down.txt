Yo! Baby girl let me take you to the essence (Uh huh)
Gift wrapped with a ribbon girl your in my presence (Ok)
Look at me and let the vision deliver the message
And ready to lead your dude listen and give me a second

So many mami's let me go in just wine 'em and dine 'em
Ass big, now I'm ready to go mountain climb 'em 
Ask Spliff, the model agency now let me sign 'em
'Cause they beautiful like they Botanical Garden asylum
While they be with they chicks and they busy tryin to hide 'em
You know your nigga lame you ain't feel him standin beside 'em
