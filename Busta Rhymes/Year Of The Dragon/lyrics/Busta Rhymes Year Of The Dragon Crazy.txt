Ayy! 
I know you love the way I come and I scorch this
Ain't nothin changed, niggaz know I'm holdin the torch bitch
Excessive with the heat, see how I'm holdin the fort sick
I twist a nigga's shit just like a fuckin contortionist
It's bang bully Bust' Rhymes, I'm comin to squash shit
Demolish every hood, disintegratin the moshpit
Spaz animal rap, they love when the god spit
I know you wish you could the way I bang 'em regardless
Hehe, it's been Conglomerate in case I ain't mention
It's bitches in this building and they all in this section
To dominate this shit has been my every intention
These niggaz think they sick, I come to KILL THE INFECTION!
And when I come through you know I'm BLOWIN the top off
the building and the club, niggaz KNOW how I pop off
And if you violate you'll probably get your shit chopped off
The way I got police, barricadin the block off!

Sometimes I act like I do
Cause of this voice in my head (voice in my head)
They tell me just what to do
Let's spend a chunk of this bread (chunk of this bread)
You make them niggaz wanna say {THEM NIGGAZ CRAZY THAN A MOTHERFUCKER}
Them niggaz psycho how they ball {THEM NIGGAZ CRAZY THAN A MOTHERFUCKER}
They buyin all the alcohol {THEM NIGGAZ CRAZY THAN A MOTHERFUCKER}
Like they was buyin out the mall {THEM NIGGAZ CRAZY THAN A MOTHERFUCKER}
Before I finish countin this bundle
So kindly as I welcome niggaz (back to the jungle!)
I'm back to run this bitch, I strive on keepin it humble
I'm here to shake the building 'til it CRACKLE AND CRUMBLE!
So BACK OUT BITCH!! See how we KNOCKIN the most odd!
'Bout to split the ocean, get to CALLIN the Coast Guard!
Better call the ambulance, I'm comin to choke y'all
I'm smashin every country bitch, I'll send you a postcard
Hehe, see now they actin like they ain't knowin
But I know you see exactly where them bottles is goin
A couple box loads, see all the money we spendin?
We drinkin 'til we stupid and the PARTY is endin
Now PEEP the way we comin in, we PICKIN shit back up!
The Tunnel 2012 the way the shit packed up
We full throttle in this bitch and never will slack up
While I feed you the heat watch how my NIGGAZ'LL ACT UP!


Ayy! 
Ohh!
