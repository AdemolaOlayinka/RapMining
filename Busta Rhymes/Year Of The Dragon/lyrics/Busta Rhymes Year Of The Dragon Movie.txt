Year Of The Dragon
2012)
I do it like a movie, my life is a movie
All my dreams are stacked up, all my belts is Gucci
Motion picture swag hoe, my fifth playin like a smoothie
I do it like a movie cause my life is a movie
My life is a movie, my life is a movie
All my dreams are stacked up, all my belts is Gucci
Motion picture swag hoe, my fifth playin like a smoothie
My life is a movie, my life is a movie

My life is a movie, chill just a little bit, damn hoe
Sorry little homie you's a has-been, played out nigga, Has-bro
Bitch I'm Marlon Brando, y'all niggaz sweeter than a mango
Y'all corny niggaz always talk y'all shit, but y'all only remind me of an asshole
Baby girl get up on the damn pole, and tell your friend hatin is for losers
Drop your nigga off in a manhole, you love the way I'm on my George Lucas?
Bone chillin 'til a nigga kill nerves, y'all know I spit scriptures
When I talk I make a nigga feel words, 3-D motion picture
Took shorty back to the crib she bought, couldn't even find a description
Ballroom-sized livin room bitch, life's yo' science fiction
Movie premiere showtime, y'all niggaz know the way we move in
All day every day red carpets, focus your lens, zoom in!


Yo, watch me, J-Doe, uhh, yeah
Okay now my life is a movie, all real with no filter
My girl got on real fur, bitch I think I'm Spielberg
More like a documentary, cause ain't no movie, this real
Flow sick and get can't well, bitch I think I'm Denzel
Get them hands in the air when I shut down the show, hop off the stage then I get it and go
Not one of these niggaz can fuck with my flow, I'm hot as the sun, you as cold as the snow
Bad bitch in my room that's action, I hug her to comin attraction
And they gon' keep goin 'til I yell cut, if you didn't know muh'fucker what


My life is a movie, limited Givenchy ostrich
Landlord, godfather of it, bitch you know what a boss is
Better get your hands up off this, suffocate your shine, vacuum
And while most niggaz still wan' hate, I'm diggin in they bitch in the bathroom
Okay slime, I tell 'em every time, y'all already know what the flash do
When the diamond gleam and the mirror flick up on it, blindin e'rything when I pass through
Do you really know what the cost is? Buggin when you take a look at all this
Don't know to count money, I just look up in them contracts and million dollar deals in the office
