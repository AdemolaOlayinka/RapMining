I'm here to dazzle ya\nWhole hood from the boroughs, to the niggaz up in Attica\nSoldiers in the streets, the Middle East, way down to Canada\nWhen it comes to the block, y'know I'm the ambassador\nFollow nobody's footsteps, but said it like a scavenger\nWanna talk money bitch!? Then holla at my manager\nThe way y'all niggaz is trash, my crew'll get to blasting ya\nTwelve shot clip, hollow tips, quick to plaster ya\nAll over the cement, spread ya like I'm mashing\nEverything, Bus-a-Bus date... but check ya fuckin calendar!\n\n\n\n\nTake me all the waaayyy, where you are (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\nI really want to mattteee, take me now\nTake us far awaayyy, to the skkkyyy (cocaina baby, cocaina baby, cocaina baby)\nI really want to mattteee, some.. time\n",
