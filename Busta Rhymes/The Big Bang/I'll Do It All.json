Good, you giving me the time to talk?\nWhile I figure it out and sort what I'm trying to say, let's walk\nJust trying to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter\nDon't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?\nI've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes\nI'm feeling something special with us, it's just one of the many signs\nI think that we have to look forward to our go-through\nAny war with you regardless what it is I'm trying to score with you\nSometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder\nIf I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under\nUntil we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend\nOh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again\n\n\nNo matter how mister, no doubt I'll die wit'cha\nUntil the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha\nI'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true\nReady to start for you, I give all my heart to you\nAnd when together I hope we never fall apart you know\nNow that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood\n\n\nI'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya\nIt's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya\nIs it something at all or did I just bump in and fall\nAnd even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call\nBut it's nothing to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen\nAnd it's nothing to stall before we talk - look\nTo tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you\nAnd thus I'm digging you, I ain't just trying to pound you\nI'm only trying to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you\nRegardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to\njust spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry\nThe recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine\nMami I like your kind that light the fireworks and bombs up\nThe type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up\nUntil the love is empty I credit the one who sent me\nThe most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she riding with me\n\n\n(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha\nIt doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha\nJust know you live through me; your love is all I need\nIf you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby\nYour dedication and commitment got me going crazy\nYour love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see\n\n\nThis is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't going nowhere\nCause you mean so much to me\nNo matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya\nIt doesn't matter to me\nBaby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya\nCause you do so much for me\nNo matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothing can come between us\nCause you mean so much to me\n\n\nListen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into trying to fuss boo\nDeeper than any lust, I'm only trying to mindfuck you\nThat's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby\nNow that you made me a man you're officially now my lady\nDespite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever\nAnd nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together\nI'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu\nI only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu\n",
