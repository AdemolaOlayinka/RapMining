Everest I climbed it\nHeat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent\nMy mind spray, my nine spray\nAnd freak styles like 3000 Andre\nTo keep pilin, keep pushin them drops\nNas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop\n\n\n\n\nNow I'm hot, and we runnin the block\nWatch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks\nAdd a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot\nDRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got\nNow I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop\nI love to fold up a knot, love totin the glock\nHelps me feel safer when niggaz try to scheme on my plot\nTry to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot\nSee I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock\nNiggaz know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not\nLose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop\nMy hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks\nSee we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer\nSplit up your head, kill a snitch for the feds\nLet's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel\nGet Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril\n",
