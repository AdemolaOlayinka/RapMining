    "lyrics": "Yeah I know\nA lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me\nYou see - I'm that nigga that you should really be afraid of\nI dig graves for niggaz like you\nWe gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it\n\n\nDo you ever think (do you ever think)\nWhat life would be (what life would be)\nWhere you will go (where will you go)\nAfter you die (after you die)\n\nYou fucked up nigga!\n\n\nYou know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin\nAnd everything you had is gone in the split of a second\nThat's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch\nJust face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit\nDespite I talk about it, I ain't makin fun of them niggaz\nI give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz\nCan't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect\nthat shit around you is lookin dumb, it's gettin hard to accept it\nAlone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile\nDisregarding the fact your running's been done for a while\nRefuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child\nContinue frontin, like it's nothin while you live in denial\nWhile all your people around you start to leave you in the same place\nYou overexert the little you have left to save face\nYou tryin to hide your expression from lookin worried\non what to do when your career is buried\n\n\n\n\nNiggaz ain't GIVIN a fuck about your flows no more\nYou ain't the star you were, fuckin the same hoes no more\nPromoters ain't payin and bookin you for shows no more\nYou ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more\nReality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up\nYou're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob\nYou run around and you front like you're still on fire\nBut nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar\nYou're onnly lyin to yourself cause it's evident in the proof\nAs your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth\nYou're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you\nBut niggaz don't even remember you enough to just shout you\nI remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully\nThe problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully\nOnce told, never burn out, it's best to fade away\nPreserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day\nPeople see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin\nYou doin shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin\nIt happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in\nYou step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin in\nForgettin you a man first, chasin the fame\nGot to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper\nbut most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried\nWhat do you do when your career is buried\n\n\n\n\nOkay\nI told you we was gonna get more acquainted\nat a time when you least expect it nigga\nI'm here to lay you to rest once and for all\nYou've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit\nBut it's okay\nNigga shut the FUCK UP AND GET IN THE BOX NIGGA! (WAIT!! Please!)\nIt was custom built for all niggaz like you\nYou just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up\n(Stop! BITCH!) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! HELP!!!)\nWHEVER THE FUCK THAT IS!! (SOMEBODY HELP!!)\n(I CAN'T BREATHE, NIGGA!)\n(OPEN THIS SHIT NIGGA!)\n(OPEN THIS SHIT!! )\n(OPEN THIS SHIT!! )\n\n(SOMEBODY HELP!! HEY!!)\n(OPEN THIS SHIT MOTHERFUCKER WHAT YOU DOIN)\n(OPEN IT!)\n",
