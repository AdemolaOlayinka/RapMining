You don't know what we doin right here!\n\n\n\nOne two three we gon' turn it out\nAnd make you rock to the beat and then scream and shout\nWe gonna hit you with the shit we got here\nWe gonna blow your miiiinnnd (blow your miiiinnnd)\nKeep it movin like this, keep it movin like that\nIf I die, I'ma only come back\nYo, I'm saying if you think that you can step to me wrong\nDon't even waste your tiiiimmme (waste your tiiiimmme)\n\n\n\nYou niggaz talk shit then abandon ship\nNiggaz talk shit then they abandon ship\nNiggaz talk shit, then they abandon ship\nNiggaz talk shit then they abandon ship\n\n\n\nI 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin over\nStick you for your blue Range Rover\nI told ya, Rampage a real live soldier\nBeen in the game, sinc the age of thirteen\nA microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.\nIt's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo\nMy P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio\nShe pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo\n\nHahahaaa! I always roam through the forest\nJust like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May\nso my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face\nlike my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus\nRock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus\nYou remain nameless, my victory remains flawless\nActing like you wild, but I know you really harmless\nWhile your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless\n\nMany niggaz wanna know when the Ramp return\nYo I'm gettin phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern\nHe wants to know about my Flip Mode click\nThe way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT\nLP after LP, we make G's\nI run up in your ganks den take you for your keys\nI'm not lying or joking, you get broken\nDead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and...\n\nPeople always askin me, how your shit be sellin\nFor makin shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin melon\nPolice throwed me up on charges like I was a felon\nThere was no tellin, when I was strikin had you swellin\nCruisin in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin\nLock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin\nYo FUCK THAT! You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin\nIf you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fuckin yellin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city...\nI can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip\nYour lost, that means you way off course\nNo remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source\n\nI be saddleback biting motherfuckers like a horse\nTurn and toss, niggaz all up in my applesauce\nWatch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse\nEver since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss\n\nAiyyo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day\nIf you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.\nNow I'm writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday\nIn the full runnin drinkin ice Tanqueray\nI don't eat pork I take a fish fellet\nNow I'm knockin out niggaz from .. to .. touche!\nNow I'm goin back around the way\nI'm rippin shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye\n\nYo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers\nGot you niggaz open like a bunch of wide receivers\nTime is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners\nChickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas\nYo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins\nSqueeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin\nWhen you talk shit you really don't know what you startin\nNow your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton\n\nIt's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz\nNow we got you open like Fixx\nStickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits\nFisherman hat with my brand new kicks\nOn the low, I still rock my Girbauds\nSee the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'\nAll my rough niggaz open the do'\nCause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'\n\nYo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper\nFuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker\nEverytime I hit I always hit a little harder\nBlazing to the point where niggaz look a little darker\nCatching suntans from my music, fans understand\nMaking fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand\nOrganized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan\nWhile your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan\nNumber one nigga in the chain of command\nBreakin fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan\nAiyyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan\nSingin at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland\n",
