Whatchu gonna do?\nWhere you think you can run, or you can hide?\nWhere you think you can run, or you can hide?!!\nWhere you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!\nWhere you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!!\n\nI'ma BE the best to show love let's co-operate\nDisloyalty is somethin that we won't tolerate\nDeal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go\nOn the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know\nSo long fightin the bullshit for so many years\nWatchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers\nYes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down\nDisrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN\nTHIS MEANS WAR!\n\n\nTake a look inside\nYou can run and you can hide\nIf you cross my path\nI'll make sure you feel my wrath\nGive and you receive\nCherish every breath you breathe\nScriptures on the wall\nThose who betray all must fall\n",
