Yeah what up?
 Hey Busta!
 Yo what up Clive?
 Busta, look, the time is right now.
 Ok.
 You got a ridiculous album...
 Right.
 ...it's hot to death...
 Thank you.
 ...we just gotta press it up, and hit the streets.
 No doubt.
 Busta? I've got some words of advice.
 And what's that Clive?
 Keep it gutter, keep it grimey.
 No question.
 One.
 Ha, one? Clive Davis, ya'll. One. Haha.
No question. Let's get straight to it.
Well Busta Rhymes! It's been a long time since
you've had a good talkin' to. And the last time I
gave you my blessings, I told you, you was gonna
encounter a lot of niggas, and bitches, tryin' to
get into your shit. Well, you've come a long ways
since me, the badass dude paid you a visit. And
even up to this point, you ain't seen shit yet!
From what I understand, you done built you a brand
new home. So this time around, before you welcome
these motherfuckers in yo' shit, make sure they
know the rules!
Rule #1!
Busta Rhymes is your
name! And breakin' motherfuckers down is your
game!
Rule #2!
As you continue to give it to 'em
raw, before they come into yo' house, make sure
they wipe they feet at the mothafuckin' door!
Rule#3!
Before these niggas misconceive you as a
pranksta, make sure these motherfuckers respect
yo' gangsta! Now moving right along, as you enter
this new place in your growth, like I told ya
before, keep slapping dick in the mouths of these
bitches that don't wanna act right! And put a hot
one in any mothafucker that tries to get in the
way of this power move shit right here! Alright,
Busta, enough with the shit talkin'. Let's welcome
these mothafuckas into the Genesis. Let's go!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
