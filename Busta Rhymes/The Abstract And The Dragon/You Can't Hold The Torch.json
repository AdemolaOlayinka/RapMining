Hehe\nShit feel all different\nY'all niggaz complainin left and right about how the game feel all fucked up\nNiggaz only been talkin like that since we been sittin out the game\nI think the game need us Kamaal, let's talk to them niggaz\nHuh!\n\nSo many nights were spent ponderin\nWonderin how we gon' come again\nMy golden rule is not to focus on the fame game\nIn retrospect, the game ain't the same mayne\nThey heart and soul is divided\nThey ramshack the music, no control up inside it\nNow - look at this, it's all stretched out and nasty\nBut - lettin money pass me\nI doubt that, and niggaz from the bottom now\nPumpin hard, wind sleet hail rain or snow\nSo... you got to get your gate right\nNo matter what, you got to treat your weight right\nOn the block if you focused on greed then\nNine out of ten times you be bleedin\nThe analogy is clear\nTo all of my peers, I'm a muh'fuckin vet\nDon't mean to disrespect, cause\n\n\"I write rhymes, I write checks\"\n(It's clear) Bust, aiyyo what happened to the (love)\nFor the game (love) for the music (I need realness in my life)\nAiyyo these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nBust, these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nAiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}\nAiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}\n\nAiyyo, I ain't bringin they names up\nThese niggaz sound trash, straight foulin the game up\nNeed to change up (change up) sound so trash\nWhen I see 'em feel like breakin they frame up\nDuPont registry, talkin 'bout somebody else cars\nMuh'fuckers better step up your bars\nInstead of frontin in the game like niggaz really are stars\nLike we ain't seein through the bullshit, we know who you are\nI'm like a blessing to the game when your shit sound dated\nI force niggaz to improve, you should be happy I made it\nHere to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather\nGivin you niggaz new shit to make the game feel better\nI'm sayin, I cook in the kitchen and we make the thoughts connect\nYou forced to humble yourself, give me my big respect\nYou hurtin the game when your shit sound off y'know\nA legend in this shit that's why I move like a boss y'know\nYou better be tight, cause you can get tossed fo' sho'\nY'all niggaz know whassup, I come correct with money long cause I\n\n\"I write rhymes, I write checks\"\n(It's clear) Tip, aiyyo what happened to the (love)\nFor the game (love) for the music (I need realness in my life)\nAiyyo these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nYo, these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nAiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}\nAiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}\n\nOh my God, they a (uh) come ridin around\nSome (uh) old dream and they (uh) can't get down\nThey (uh) lookin around outside of themselves\nAnd they {HUH} sayin things that ain't really themselves\nAnd they {hah} keep fuckin regurgitatin the same script\nSame hoes, same blow, same glock clip {ha}\nSame drug strip, what the fuck is this? (uh)\nC'mon y'all, raise the bar on this body, shit\n\nYou sound stagnant, need to progress and grow (uh-huh)\nUpgrade your punchlines, progress the flow (uh-huh)\nGet your concepts and lyrics together, aiyyo (uh-huh)\nThen drop the bomb shit to step up the pressure, y'know? (huh!)\nI'm tired of niggaz complainin how the game changed\nYou niggaz should step up your game, cause you sound strange\nThat's why you ain't sellin no records, check the SoundScain\nIn this rap shit I command respect muh'fucker cause I\n\n\nAiyyo these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nBust, these niggaz in the game don't sound the same\nAiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}\nAiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}\n",
