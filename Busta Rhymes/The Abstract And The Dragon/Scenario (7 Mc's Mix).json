    "lyrics": "Here in 1992 we present\nThe fabulous What's The Scenario remix\nWhereas there are seven MC's\nSix which are in physical form and one which is in spiritual essence\nAnd he goes by the name of, uh... HOOD!\n\nCheck the vibe, walk that ass or get got\nF it (shit) I lick buckshots\nHood, madman, I rip up stages\nLay down your wages, I'm wild like Larry Davis\nExtra, extra, pick up a clip\nI'll tear ass out the frame (Ha!) and grab my dick (Ohh!)\nI'm a Rock'Em Sock'Em robot kid, I drop bombs\nI'm rugged and deadly, so I shit on the petty\nI baseball bat a bastard, I'm bad news\nI'm crazy and clever, cut throats of crews\nDeath on the phono, my skills are porno\nYou say \"oh no,\" you bitch ass homo\nI bag up waste, electrifyin', I'm prime-time\nI slaughter a slime, I'm the greatest of all time\nSick ass brother, nasty ass nigga\nPump slugs in your face, and dump that ass in the river\nTwo tears in a bucket, fuck it, kick the can\n(Say what, say what?) I'm a bad, bad man\n\nQuick is how I flip from the tip of the lip\nPunchin' out hits like Gladys Knight and the Pips\nThe five-foot assassin has just raided your area\nYour booty rhymes are wack and that's the reason I ain't hearin ya\n(So!) Roll out the red carpet cause I'm kickin' this\nVanilla Ice platinum? That shit's ridiculous\nExcuse my French, but profanity is all I knew\nAnd to you other sellouts, oh yeah, F you too\nAnd let it be known, I'm not the one to step to\nYou're better off calling D-Nice to your rescue\nFreestyle fanatic, probably the best around\nAs for corny MCs, like Chuck D, I shut 'em down\nThe Artical Don of hip-hop and I won't stop\nThe five-foot assassin has come to wreck 'nuff shop\nSo do like Michael Jackson and \"Remember the Time\" (Do you remember?)\nPut on your dancin' shoes or somethin cause you sure can't rhyme\n\n(Big up, big up!) Enter new identity\nNext to say something cause you pass it to me\nWhat does it take to check a technique?\n(Many styles, many styles!)\nHostile heat, brings bursts of energy\nMilo in De Dance is the new identity\nOne two mic check, select for the ruffneck sect\nTen to one that I come (Correct!)\nIn my cyphers on blocks, I bring box to connect with knots\nSo I can grow dreadlocks\nMaintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)\nMaintain the rock (Don't stop the rock)\nKicking right inna your what's it not\nI could rock longer but fair is fair\nSo C. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)\nC. Brown are we in the clear? (Yeahhh!)\n\nMakin moves y'all (Moves y'all!) On and on and on\n(Check it, check it out!!) To the break of, break of dawn\n(Who's that?!) just one of the L.O.N.S\nAnd a Tribe Called Quest (East coast) to West\nRemix mad kick, more than Metallica\nTo all MCs fall like the Battlestar Galactica\nStampin', stompin', rompin' Compton\n(People all over the world!) I'm promptin (Style!)\nPick a style, any style, Strong Isle\nRepresentation, sensationalization\n\"Scenario\" for the radio, 'BLS and KISS, so\n(Here we go yo!) Yeah\nForce, Main Source LP on the rise\nIn living color we'll see seen through original eyes\nAnd I'm out like shout, Ooh Ahh, Ooh Ahh\n(Ooh ahh, ooh ahh!) There it is baby pah\n\nFlying in on a limb, slim trim, D I am\nThere I am (There I am!) Don't run from a grim\nSight we be right, be polite for my mics\nLike I'm like (See sick, see syke)\nAnd slip away, and off to the Poconos\nSpot picked the clothes, hype swing the pretty pose\nYamaha (Ay-Ha May!)\nLet's split the funk, now it all spells (Hey!)\nEnough enough, Ms. Fitted I'm with it\nIf I did it, I was blitted, and probably shouldn't have quit it\nCause yo, my vocal status at Knight's like the Gladys\nBed rest, spread test, and yo I'm like the maddest\nMale, not female, hail from Uniondale\nBounce the b-ball cause beats are being yelled\nIn the hallways always ringing with a (Ho!)\nThis one two times nine on the Scenario\n\nCheck it out everybody, rhymes and mics\nBlack Benz gettin looped (Doin' what they like!)\nEight black brothers in the public eye\nIf you listen very close, I will tell you why\n(Hood!) Phife, Milo, Dinco and C. Brown\nShaheed, myself, and Busta Bust Down\nWill commence to rock (Rock!) So bring on the flocks (Flock!)\nIn-terrogation for the knockin of the box\nThe boom-box ruler, controls the medulla\nNone come cooler, I win like Shula\nSo bust out the moves as you start to pursue her\nIntensified mind, nine-blunt consumer\nTip will come booty (Well it's only a rumor!)\nThe meanin' so deep that it starts brain tumors (Tumors!)\nPeace to Hood baby from the midnight crooner\nSmoke 'em up later, if not then sooner\n\nHey what we gon do (Dooo) in '92\nEven though we had fun (Fuuun) in '91\nWonderful my days, herb dream comin' down\nPonna ponna new sound, leavin' cracks in the ground\nWhat's goin on my man? (Goddamn!) And now my brain is hurtin'\nListen up, Busta, rhythm will hit 'em then I get 'em\nRip on 'em, shit on 'em, hit on 'em, then I will sit on 'em\nOpen up your mouth if you want the food\nTo get rude, Flipmode, cause I'm in the mood\nAh-heh, ah-heh! Yeah man, that's how it goes\nBody drippin with blood comin out your nose\nGive me a Band-Aid, what are you askin for?\n(More!) Only your sacred and pure\nAdverse, Zig-Zag, check it and the Busta new rap\nRap, Busta Rhymes, or bust this wicked rhymes\nYeah y'all in '92, I'm packin my roach spray (Anyway!)\nDing-A-Ling, Tribe Called Quest, Leaders of the New School\nMad brother when stealthy RRRAAAOW RRAOW RRAOW!\nTo my dragon, baby, stop whinin' I see my influence still shinin'\nMore crazy in '92, uh oh, time to go, yo\nThat's the Scenario!\n",
