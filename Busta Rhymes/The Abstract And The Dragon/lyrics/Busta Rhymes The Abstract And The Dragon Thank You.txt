Busta Rhymes
The Abstract And The Dragon
2014
Woo, welcome to the bank
Where you deposit Young Money and you get Cash Money
I'm Tunechi the Boss
And live from the vault is Busta Buss

Swag mania, pop that goes most
Carry the most beautiful bitches
With us, happily toast
Keep the faculty close
Gross when we give them a dose
Got them doing, leaning in each coast
Scenery froze, take notes, Rock Rolls
Diamonds that fit in Chanel Minks in the winter
Who fucking with us
We coming to give them the shivers
Watery flows, spilling like rivers
Flooding the street, hoping niggas swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

Please don't throw up
Hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas
We going to show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars
It's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in
My niggas bite like Rin Tin Tin, my chagrin
You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin
She gives in every time that I spin
Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball
So what's cracking with y'all

Native New Yorker
And the slick talker keeps it in order
Call the reporter
Stepping like the British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, see how we do it
Get them into it steadily God, I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool, until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Bossing it up, maintaining composure, stand on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can GET IT

Yeah
It feel good, don't it, uh
It feel good, don't it, uh
Ay, I want to let y'all know, ay ay
I want to let y'all know, this Yeezy
And you listening to Q-Tip

Settle up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making your dough
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done rip up your paper, cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge
You're just a single, cause you wouldn't engage
You turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goblets with us

See how we push sometimes a man fi get kuff, beat him in the head
Boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, "stop killing me, Wolf", whop
Beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof
Oxy in me pulse
He don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit, we sinners when me and Abstract are together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers, dammit, we winners
Pillar of this rap shit, homie, they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow
And then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me

Incredibly we do it, and it resonates the music
I tune it, YouTube it, it could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas
Bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners
Blatant non-believers and over-achievers
Kicking it in Pele Adidas
Drink Alize liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us, and her man's attitude defeat us
But never a scandal
Because me and Bus we're prone to handle, we're gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans
Second, he need some medicine
Before I black as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas
But then again, you need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless
It's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons
See how I come and bring out the betterness
Time is with it, I rep the foreverness
Flying, United Emirates, sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left
I want to thank you Heavenly Father
For shining your light on me
I want to thank you Heavenly Father
For shining your light on me
I know it couldn't have happened without you
Ooo-ooh without you-ooooooohhh
Without you-ohh
Without you
