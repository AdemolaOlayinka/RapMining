What the fuck y'all niggas come around here for\nWe massacre the masses so therefore\nHere's your, invitation to explore\nThe way we gather up niggas to thoroughly rep for\nMy street niggas, C'mon!\nStressed niggas, C'mon!\nHungry niggas, C'mon!\nYes, yes y'all, C'mon!\nHope my live motherfuckers pass the test y'all\nPrepare for high retribution, and I hope God bless y'all (bless y'all)\nFuck shit up and watch the truth manifest y'all (fest y'all)\nFeel it in your guts and the burnin in your chest y'all (chest y'all)\nPushin through just like a wild flood\nWith such a pain that's so intense it make y'all wanna cry blood\nMy slang talk earned a scholarship, from how to style a chick\nInflunce rulership and earn another dollar quick (quick)\nYou need to do the philisophical research\nFuck around and be the next to die you better leave first\nYo, my whole crew extra large, stay charged\nLike polytheism havin belief in many gods\nI gotta handful of niggas wit a sick disease\nDie close to destructive anti-social tendencies\nYo, turn up the treble just a level\nAnalyze the science deeper than when Musa symbolized the devil\nNow let me ask y'all\n\n\n\n\n\nHa, all hell break loose\nYo, we fight to the end and never call for a truce\nY'all niggas better pick and choose and select the battles wisely\nAlways with the same approach and never once surprised me\nHa, however how clever\nNiggas is fighting for mad cheddar\nYo, cold like the wind blow in the winter\nMake you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger\nThis Means War, I said it before\nAdrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor\nTry to threat and wanna battle me nigga\nI'ma show you the major differnce between a dream and reality nigga\nYo, then I continuously hype up a nation\nHuddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation\nAnd analyze how many niggas gon lose\nTryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes\nAnd analyze how we was needed to live\nCarry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative\nPass this to all my seeds after me\nRepresent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be\nThe economy has been at it's best, to all my niggas hungry\nLet's keep weavin and magical methods of makin money\nSo I'ma rep at my fullest, you can't spark me\nAnd fight the hardest in the grim current state of Anarchy...\n",
