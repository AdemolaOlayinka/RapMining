Anarchy
2000)
What this world is comin to, to, to
Can you see, see, see, see
What's in store for you, for you, you, you, you, you, you, you


Yo, right before I lay your soul to sleep
Witness the day of your wreckin and wit god on the street
Behold! What the fuck y'all niggas come around here for
We massacre the masses so therefore
Here's your, invitation to explore
The way we gather up niggas to thoroughly rep for
My street niggas, C'mon!
Stressed niggas, C'mon!
Hungry niggas, C'mon!
Yes, yes y'all, C'mon!
Hope my live motherfuckers pass the test y'all
Prepare for high retribution, and I hope God bless y'all (bless y'all)
Fuck shit up and watch the truth manifest y'all (fest y'all)
Feel it in your guts and the burnin in your chest y'all (chest y'all)
Pushin through just like a wild flood
With such a pain that's so intense it make y'all wanna cry blood
My slang talk earned a scholarship, from how to style a chick
Influnce rulership and earn another dollar quick (quick)
You need to do the philisophical research
Fuck around and be the next to die you better leave first
Yo, my whole crew extra large, stay charged
Like polytheism havin belief in many gods
I gotta handful of niggas wit a sick disease
Die close to destructive anti-social tendencies
Yo, turn up the treble just a level
Analyze the science deeper than when Musa symbolized the devil
Now let me ask y'all





Ha, all hell break loose
Yo, we fight to the end and never call for a truce
Y'all niggas better pick and choose and select the battles wisely
Always with the same approach and never once surprised me
Ha, however how clever
Niggas is fighting for mad cheddar
Yo, cold like the wind blow in the winter
Make you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger
This Means War, I said it before
Adrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor
Try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
I'ma show you the major differnce between a dream and reality nigga
Yo, then I continuously hype up a nation
Huddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
Pass this to all my seeds after me
Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be
The economy has been at it's best, to all my niggas hungry
Let's keep weavin and magical methods of makin money
So I'ma rep at my fullest, you can't spark me
And fight the hardest in the grim current state of Anarchy...
