    "lyrics": "yo, it all began like, bust it\nMy nigga City bout to bounce on a trip\nWe met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip\nI told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip\nTravel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip\nGood lookin, word to mother son I give you my wit\nBut when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib\nOn the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound\nWit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town\nNow, three days pass I'm still on the strip\nDoin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips\nWith little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project\nWhen police come we stick the clips in any metal object\nThrowin a nigga on the walls and try to search me down\nI laugh knowin that my stash'll never be found\nWell anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip\nWit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip\nMy nigga hit me with the latest, greatest\nHe told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is\nHe said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is\nWhat kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz\nHow they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American\nAnd how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans\nAnd how they stay wit four pounders\nAnd speak American to try to blend in\nLike they aint obvious out of towners\nOkay, I've never heard of workers gettin five G's pay\nFor trips that last for only 2-3 day\nHow these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini\nRockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini\nThem type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em\nRockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em\nHow they rock silks and tailor made pants\nAnd get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance\nWashrags hangin from every one of our back pockets\n>From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it\nAnd set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential\nRock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals\nHow they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy\nAnd love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy\nAfter all of that I wanted ones\nThe way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son\nSo now we out of town with Guyanese cats\nUp in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats\nShit was slow until the main fiend was offed\nJust like a thief in the night\nAnd spread the word that we was back with the white\n\n\n\"Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door\nand shut the fuck up\"\n\"Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...\"\n\"Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates\nand the gym star\"\n\"Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that\"\n\"Fuck this shit\"\n\n\nYeah, see how we blowin pa\nThe lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers\nBuggin on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours\nSo on and so on, shit is good and we eatin\nFirst nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin\nThe whole town, see we now own it\nCarryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments\nWe stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear\nAnd we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas\nWe love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit\nBut in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit\nNow these niggas was really ready to swell up\nWe decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop\nOff in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid\nWe set up shops and watched the games begin\nSo now we ballin like a motherfucker, money was sick\nGas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick\nFuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass\nTo attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast\nWe used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt\nAnd watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built\nAint it funny how shit transpire in fact\nNot too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at\nSome niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm\nNot a problem so immediately reach for the john\nRight away the gun BUST! straight lifted a nigga\nHow we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga\nWild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats\nLeavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats\nNow we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands\nBut fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans\nShit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall\nMy son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all\nWord, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold\nThen I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole\nSo as we continue to radically blaze the fifth\nFlame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?\nWell we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook\nOne nigga slid and think he got off the hook\nNow let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied\nWas one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party\nHe was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes\nStupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain\nSuddenly my nigga fell to the floor\nAnd said his legs feel like them shits aint got no feelins no more\nMore the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut\nThe shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!\n\nThat's a wrap, good actin motherfuckers, good actin\nThat's the shit I'm talkin about\nY'all ready to watch the playback?\nFuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers\n",
