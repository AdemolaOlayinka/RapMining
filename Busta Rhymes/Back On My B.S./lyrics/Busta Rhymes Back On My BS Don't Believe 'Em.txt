When they tell you that you'll never get over (ha ha ha)
Just tell 'em they're number one (el capitan partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!
(I can't hear ya, I'm way up here, what you say?)
Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go Bust!)


Now, there's, nothin you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm goin in (hey!)
I'ma make the world feel my pain
while I'm showin you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't SHIT
We ain't got nothin but EVERYTHING to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so BLESSED - do anything that you could do to stop me (STOP ME)
Now I'm climbin up the ladder and I'm jumpin at the top
You might wanna call me - ROCKY
See there's more of us - UGLY
You don't really wanna war with us - TRUST ME
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious - HUG ME


I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watchin you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin)
They just tellin you lies, they want you to fail
They're plottin on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
Sooooo, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
(You know exactly what to tell 'em!)
Just tell 'em they're number one (number one)
You're a champion!


Hey, see the websites lyin tryin to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flyin like I don't got time
Got e'rybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? Best get me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new .40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip fallin off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God homie




Any situation where you might get FED UP
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doin
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better STEP UP
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin
Ain't nothin in the work gon' really stop what you're doin (OHH!)
Go hard no matter what they be sayin
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it movin (OHH!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (WE)
Me and you securin a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be (OHH!)
Stay up on your grind, be the first one to - SET IT
People try to shut me down, I won't - LET IT
I'm so stubborn for the success
You know my motto - don't stop, get it, get it!




Tell 'em they're number one
