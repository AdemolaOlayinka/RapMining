Best get me off it\nAt least quit lyin if you must keep talkin\nGo on with the nonsense, best keep walkin\nBoy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office\nA lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty\nCouple months off, I'll be right back shawty\nWith a brand new swag and a brand new .40\nAnd a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it\nNation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it\nShawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?\nTip fallin off sound kinda odd, don't it?\nY'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God homie\n\n\n\n\nAny situation where you might get FED UP\nGotta stay focused, homie keep your head up\nIt don't really matter what the next one is doin\nHomie gotta handle your business and then you better STEP UP\nLive to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin\nAin't nothin in the work gon' really stop what you're doin (OHH!)\nGo hard no matter what they be sayin\nNigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it movin (OHH!)\nTake a look and see yourself in me\nCause it's all about we (WE)\nMe and you securin a win together\nSo we could be the best that we could ever be (OHH!)\nStay up on your grind, be the first one to - SET IT\nPeople try to shut me down, I won't - LET IT\nI'm so stubborn for the success\nYou know my motto - don't stop, get it, get it!\n\n\n\n\nTell 'em they're number one\n",
