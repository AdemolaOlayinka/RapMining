Out! Up and down!\nWhen you're doin' the Bart, you're really gettin' down!\nWhen you're doin' the Bart, you're gonna get wet\nRight Guard can't save you, 'cause you're bound to sweat\nFat girls, we ain't forgot about you\nThe Bart's the dance that you can even do\nFirst you need a tight fade, a couple black medallions,\nSome skiddo pants and then start dancin'\nUnlike the Hammer, unlike the Humpty,\nWhen you're doin' the Bart, you've gotta get funky!\n\n\nIt's the dance of the 90s, motherfuckers act wild\nYour Granny can do it, so you should try\nIt's not just a dance; it's a state of mind\nThe fellas need to hi-jump the girls' big behinds\nKeep shakin' your head, like a goose\nAnd work your body 'till it get loose\n\n\nJump up and down, but don't freak or hustle\nWhen you're doin' the Bart, you use every muscle\nDon't hurt yourself or exert yourself\nYou can do the Bart all by yourself\nSo why you sittin' there in your seat?\nJust get on the floor and Bart to the beat!\n",
