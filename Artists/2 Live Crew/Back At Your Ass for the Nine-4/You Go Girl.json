And Kentucky Fried Chicken!\n(*cheering*) I mold it together, baby!\nI mold it together, honey!\nOh, that alum, lemme tell ya somethin\nThat alum makes it tight (right!)\nLSD makes it outta sight (yeah!)\nAnd Kentucky Fried Chicken make it finga lickin good!\n\n(You go girl)\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\n(You go girl)\n\n\nGet on the dance floor\nAnd move your body til ya can't no, more\nTouch the ground\nCause I like the way you doo-doo brown\nYou make me wanna flip\nPlus I love the way you shake them, hips\n>From side to side\nAlways keepin my nature on the rise\nCause you got it goin on\nAnd you're the only one havin fun\nWatchin the niggas sweat\nAnd how it feels when you're wet\nDoin what you want til it hurts\nAs RuPaul say, You'd Better Work\nShake ya ass til it twirls\n(You go girl)\n\n(Go girl!)\n(You go girl)\netc.\n\n\nYou know you got it goin on, honey dip, I swear\nTwo niggas takin care of you, and doin up ya hair\nYou used to look shady but ya changed ever since\nNow it's all about the leather boots and sequins\nTellin niggas don't holla if ya can't get the snap\nGot a diamond name plate and a neckace to match\nDiamonds on ya hand, sippin on cham'\nNiggas wanna holla but ya say I got a man\nThe bitch is so fly if they're goin' off in her, G\nNow look at honey dip, push you off ?inity?\nSo if ya ain't got loot ya can't mack her\nIt's all about the hammers on the big body Acura\nOr a hundred with a car fulla friends\n?Say fresh hairdo? and ?Oscar de la Rinte?\nNiggas get mad cause they can't lay the pipe in\nCause you wanna holla, baby, claimin that you're dykin\nBut in 9-4, it's show and tell\nKeep doin what ya doin and go on, girl\n\n(You go girl)\netc.\n\n(Tell em brother!)\n(Tell em brother!) (Yeahhh!)\n(Tell em brother!)\n(Tell em - Tell em brother!) (Yeahhh!)\n(Tell em brother!)\n(Tell em brother!) (Yeahhh!)\n(Tell em brother!)\n(Tell em brother!) (Yeahhh!)\n\n\nHere's a song for the ladies\nWho work ya nerves and drive ya crazy\nKeep givin it all ya got\nJust shake that ass, make the niggas hot\nAnd the way you lick them lips\nI know you suck skin off a dick\nCause you're the one to rock my world\nJust keep on suckin (Go Girl)\n\n\nI know you're all about the hair, doin nails done weekly\nLookin for a nigga packin big grip, seek me\nI wonder if you're singlin so we can get a-minglin\nMy ding-a-ling'll sure get ya ear rings jinglin\nYou want diamonds and pearls, but ya name ain't Prince\nI bought ya that, and ya started actin shady ever since\nLike I said before, it's all about show and tell\nKeep doin what ya doin and go on, girl, uh\n\n(You go girl)\netc.\n",
