Spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies\nI'm real sensitive to the fact\nOf why must you go out like that\nYou can't say nothin' positive\nAll I get are negative responses\nThey say it's hard to keep a good man down\nBut it's not hard to have one up off the ground\nHe said, she said, this-n-that\nBut who's tellin' the truth? It ain't like that\nI knew somethin' was wrong, I knew it all along\nBut nobody told me what was goin' on\nSo just STOP ... all this disrespect\n'Cause now is the time for me to put you in check\nThey say the truth hurts, but don't get mad at me\nI'm talkin' to those who got larceny\n\n\nLarceny, meaning bein' jealous-hearted\nOver little or nothin', it can get started\nFor example, a man wants to get ahead\nOthers wish he failed and rather see him dead\nAlways puttin' obstacles in your path\nIt becomes a problem you shouldn't have\nIt's like a disease spreadin' faster than AIDS\nThe word is out, they misspelled your name\nPeople look at you a little strange\nYou gain more foes as your lifestyle change'\nThey want what you got, that's the dollars that you clock\nTo you it's petty but to them it's a lot\nMaterial things they couldn't retain\nStill hopin' your loss will be their gain\nYet we strive to stay alive and live carefree\nOthers still have that larceny\n\n\n\nYou'll shake my hand, pretend to be my friend\nAnd behind my back, wish it all would end\nPeople mention my name, you'll frown your face\nHopin' in your dreams you'll take my place\nThe things that I own you wish you had\nEvery time I do good it makes you mad\nYou're not a friend to me, just an enemy\nA sucker that rhymes, a wanna be\n\nYou wanna be like me, only in your dreams\nYou wanna be down, but you gotta come clean\nRockin' boomin' beats on every cut\n2 Live's in effect, why you sweatin' us?\nWishin' you had all the money I've made\nAnd all the females that I've slayed\nYou hate me, boy, now ain't that a pity\nYou ain't got the vapors, you got larcen\n",
