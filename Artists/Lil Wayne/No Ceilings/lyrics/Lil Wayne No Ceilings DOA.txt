Ugh, fiji water granddaddy purp
Excuse me I let da semi auto-matic burp
Blood gang muthafucka call me red alert
Young carter, kill in order who get it 1st
Stuff dat gurl with dick till her head burst
Young wizzle, flow needles I can thread shirts
Boy you aint did shit I den said worst
Flip your fitted cap back like fred durst
Ugh, fiji water og kush
I drink verses & eat hooks
Got da stove on my waist & we cooks
Im in da way you cant pass like aaron brooks
President ride da car slow
I let my driver drive I'm on part 4
Spit hangin from my mouth retard flow
& I say wat I want like an award show
Im on sum shit dat aint even cum out da ass yet
Sit back & watch da green grow like da grass wet
Young or old there aint no comparing me
I just cleared dat up moment of clarity ugh!

Ugh, I'm about to go almonds
Young head-bussa get ya helmets
You niggas real soft wat is that velvet
I get big chips you get alvins
Ugh, I'm about to go wal-nuts
We get 7-digit money you can call us
Hit em wit da choppa watch em ball up
Paint ya face red you all dolled up
Yea, young nino nigga
Do it for my team tim tebow nigga
Im killing dis shit grim-reap flow nigga
Gettin swalloed by da maybach deep-throat nigga!
Ugh, I'm about to go planters
Im still in my prime deion sanders
We all gamblers, I will not lose
Flow precious as diamonds, I drop jewels
Ugh, gimme mine imma take mine
Smoke da purple, I heard it to da grapevine
Weezy baby a.k.a your heiness
I just killed dis shit moment of silence ugh,
(but I aint finished uh-uh....NO CEILINGS muthafucka yea)
Ugh, I'm in da zone like a fast-ball
& I fucked da game up like a bad call
Let da money stack, dont let da cash fall
Bars all day, no last call
Ugh, I'm in da redzone nigga
Wake up in da morning with ya head gone nigga
Birdman jr. wings spread on niggas
Leave da beef in da streets & bring da bread home nigga
Yea, tell da doctor step aside please
Dr. carter gasoline in your ivs
Strong dry weed
Make my eyes bleed
Strong arm wrap
I rock an iron sleeve
Ugh, I'm in da zone like da secondary
No lie bitch I'm flier than a pet canary
Im a dog on da beat fuck da vetenary
Two women praise me like mary-mary
Ugh, I'm in da zone like college ball
Spit fire like I'm cippin on a molotov
Loose bowels dis shit so easy
Jay-Z (I might send this to da mixtape weezy)
Ugh,hahahahaha
NO CEILINGS yea
