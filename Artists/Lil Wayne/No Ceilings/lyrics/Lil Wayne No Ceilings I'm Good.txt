Ok, Boston Red Sox cap, I get baseball money
Used to do it big, but now bitch I do it Paul Bunyan
Cincinnati Reds cap, skinny jeans, black chucks
Hollywood shotgun, watch me make you act up
Saints cap, new car, paint that if it ain't black
Red light, press a button, make the top think back
That was tough, so are us, no such thing as sober up
You close minded, I shoot you in the head I bet chu open up
High yellow woman with her hair to her ass
Bring her home, fuck her like a belt den I crash,
And when it comes to head, I get dat head of the class
I got them green backs like I laid on the grass
Lucci be my nigga, the east is up the building
Young Mula bait, the blanks already filled in
Fire alarm dick, them bitches wanna pull
Weezy baby nigga I ain't just good muthafucka I'm...

I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood
(Hehe No Ceilings)
I'm Goooooood
I'm Goooooood

Yea,
Still no job bitch, but I ain't hurtin'
Phone still ringin' so I'm still workin'
Got coke for a starters drink if you still slurpin'
Even got a couple pills if your back hurtin'
Uhhh, they call me Mister Pharmaceutical,
I'm getting money every time I'm in the studio,
I'm getting money bitch even when I do a show,
I get the money even if I have to sue a hoe,
That's how the game go eastside play it cold,
We love the new coupes, we love the necks froze,
You could'ntbeat me if you could,
Weezy baby, Lucci Lou and we goood...
