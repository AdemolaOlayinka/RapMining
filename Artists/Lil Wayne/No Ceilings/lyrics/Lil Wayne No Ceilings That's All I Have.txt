Ha, pikaboo bitch,
Swag scare your kids,
My airplane clothes flyer than your bestes shit,
Gorillas in the mist, pro black pump they fist,
I'm from the planet of the apes, King kong clips,
Silence lambs bitch,
Run through your land trippin,
Can't pretend when this is real as it gets can ya,
If shit hits the fan, I Ron Artest niggas,
This how I'm living getting tatted in some house slippers,
I like my bitches simple, laid back, relax it's mental,
shit you know what I do,
Tell me what you tryna get into,
The man cars rented,
The man car killing,
Gossiping fuck the car look at the man in it
Ha boys to man business,
We don't hire bitches,
Just fire bitches,
It's young money fire spitters,
Them red ants is with us
And they ain't ate they dinner,
Beginners feast, feet lying fatality finish,
I'm killin these records they put me in guiness
I really don't giv a f-f-uck if you witness,
You hear it, listen, buy it, steal it,
I'm still gonna get my fucking percentage,
I cuss a lot cause bitch I'm seers,
Young no beard, get soup,
Like gumbo with shrimp,
Flyer than Dumbo ears is, bitch,

Uhh, now let me start by sayin
I don't like this beat,
But I'm a weather the storm I'm a lightening streak,
Uhh, Weezy F baby, I do it big weigh me,
Them crazy freaky bitches try to cirque du soliel me,
Got some new bitches, trail got me laughing,
The one that gave me head can suck the nail out a casket,
Shot gun on the kitchen table,
The shells in the cabinet,
fucking with me is like stepping on the tail of a dragon,
Wet pussy is my cabin,
More bitches than a pageant,
I keep a house full nigga call me bob sagat,
Spending time backwards,
Hotter than a cactus,
And we ain't in the building we the fucking contractors,
Y YM, why muthafuck why hate it,
Young Money down your throat gotta stay hydrated,
Quarter bag weezy,
Young time brady,
Open up your mouth and catch a bomb baby,
Hehe good morning dude,
Eagle street corner dude,
Long dough, no short bread, no lorna doon,
I'm warning you,
We on the move,
Bunch of female dogs and garden tools,
That's bitches and hoes,
Hospital full, sick of my flow,
Hip hop was washed up so I bought some change to finish my load,
I load millions and more millions,
Money to the ceiling,
nigga no ceiling!

Step up in this bitch 5 o clock in the morning,
The world is waking up you can hear the pigeons yawning,
I'm a get that worm now,
Tell em it's my turn now,
Yo niggas need a lesson on some ethic you gon learn now,
I do this for the love of it,
Saliva cause I love to spit,
And I juke it for my future records
You gon love to spin,
Fucking with my bredren 10 years strong,
And he put them dreds in silver john long,
But he's more like platinum,
Hold up heres a napkin,
Pick your jaw up off the floor
And tuck your tongue right back in,
Tell me where is Mack Maine
... That's all I have
