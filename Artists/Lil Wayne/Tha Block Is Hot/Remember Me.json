Tha little G, never die\nTook one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die\nRemember he? Tha little G, never die\nHave B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die\nLil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack\nWeezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's\nTha little G, he was raised keepin' it real\nThat's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga\n\nLook, look\nThat time I forgot tha bills\nAin't been home in two weeks\nMacita lookin' for me\nTha word all over tha streets\nWell, shiiit! I love my momma\nBut all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems\nI lay back in tha cut\nThese niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here\nWe all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here\nTha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow\nI can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor\nThey got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders\n{gun cocks} Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)\nWell, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address\nHe said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'im there (Meet him there)\nNigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?)\nWithin a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)\nOh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)\nCowards start hollerin' 'cause they know I'm comin' for it\n\n\nLemme tell 'em\nYou remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out\nBlunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought\nRun in your house, \"Lay down! Nobody move!\nTell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!\"\nThat's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs\nLots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up\nSome niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me\nMy lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me\n!Okay! (!okay!)\nListen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)\n'Cause, see, ya'll got it\nI gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)\nRight now I'm doin' bad\nSo just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag\nI'm street-livin'... week for week\nNo-sleep livin'\nLook outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'\nMy heat sizzlin'\nI'm ready ta sweep these niggas\nGeezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!\n\n\nLook, remember that?\n\nWuz up, (Are you rememberin', B.Geezy?)\nI remember you, nigga, we go way back ta True Story, (Now) nigga, ya heard\nme\n\nLook, you don't remember me?\n\nI remember ya, nigga\n\nI was.. I was (You were doggin') a bad dog... (You were a lil' dog) Highly\nGrove 17, off top, nigga (Uh-huh)\n",
