I hang hang\nWho am I? Lil' Wayne, man\nI represent CMB\nMy cell is ten in heat\nI usually get in beef\nWas taught that it's him or me\nI pop head-bustas quick\nI rock here for my brick\nI chop that, I'ma\nMy shop here\nI always.. thug in black\nAnd always.. bustin' gats\nYour girly's.. fuckin' back\nNow how you... lovin' that\n\nHot Boy$, wardy.. respect.. us\nRepresen-tin' Cash Money.. Records\nIt's warfare, you betta.. vest.. up\nBut if you ain't scared, they blow.. your.. set.. up\n\nListen, listen\nI give it to 'em how they ask me\nRaw and nasty\nTha AK, I pack it\nBelieve I'm 'bout that action\nSlash a busta like a fraction\nI'm on that yolla\nStandin' on tha corner with one sleeve over my shoulder\nRide on your block, I see a dozen of weak jerks\nNow it's time for your momma ta order a dozen of T-shirts\nFor only half-a brick\nI'll blast tha fifty\nAnd I ain't gon' stop shootin' 'til I jam tha clip\nYeah, I'm a small creeper, what\nBut it's about ta get ugly\nYa'll betta call people up\nI'm about ta start shovin' my sawed-off between your guts\nWayne 'bout ta (cugghh-gghh-gghh) ball people up\nYa'll betta duck\nWhen it get real, they hide from me\nBut, all them bustas 'bout ta get killed, I'm tired of it\nMan, I'm thuggin' 'til tha day I.. I die, cousin\nWeezy Wee.. let 'em burn, bring tha fire truck in... (whoooo!)\n\nNigga, let it be known\nI'll come blow up your home\nTake a few blunts to tha dome\nAnd.. show up alone\nJust me and my.. flame-torch\nWayne start.. danger\nWalked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya\nBurnin' off that Hennesy\nSome-a ya'll be feminine\nBounce in with a twitch\nLeave 'em crawlin' out a ditch\nGod damn... son of a shhh!.. Don't speak\nI cocked that, and let it go, tssss!.. Give 'em heat\nYour cheese, I got.. ta.. get.. paid\nI'm goin' all out, no matter what.. it.. takes\nI.. was.. raised.. up on.. that.. paper\nKill-for-the-scrill was.. in.. my.. nature\nTote M1's and keep.. tha.. block.. hot\nSell wrong colts to keep.. my.. glock.. hot\nNever add taxes to.. my.. price, man\nAnd if a boy play, I ride.. at.. night, man\nWhat!\n\n\nUh, uh, uh\nSay Lil' Weezy\nYou did this one here, ya heard me\nThey ain't gon' never get weared out from this one\nIt's like they said, boy\nIn tha year 2000, it's all about Wayne\nIt's your chrome, man, run that thang\n17th ward to tha 3rd ward downtown\nDo that there\nHuh, huh, huh, huh\n",
