I ain't lyin', I'm thugged out!\nI'm from uptown... and that ain't no Beverly Hills\nYou wan' know what that be like? Well, curiousity kills\nSend chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy\n'Specially if it's a drought, I got ta have tha money\nTake tha hit, even if it's below tha average money\nGot to make it through tha week, and feed my family uppy\nI'm just a lil' thug, what\nBelt-buckle fall down to my cuffs, what\nAnd police don't even matter, they can suck what\nTha price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what.. what\n\nNobody burn them blocks like-a we (nawww)\nNobody bust them heads like-a we (hmmmm)\nNobody could outshin we\nTha whole CMR, CMR family (What!)

( For real!!)\n\nNigga outta line, get smoked\nI don't kidd, or joke\nFuckin' with my B.G., off top I'm goin' broke\nI don't play with these niggas\nI get.. low down and dirty\nAnd have niggas' brains coverin' tha ground\nI'm tha number-one stunter, you don't want my trouble\nI'll have four niggas in your hood in my hummer\nI'm from back in tha game, but ain't a damn thing change\n\nYa get a whole thing for ten, nigga, tha price tha same\n\nMy money long, but it don't run with tha airport\nI just bought a Hotel Cash Money Resort\nHos love my grill, hos love my crib\n\nThese hos just love tha way that.. Baby live\n\nBut I'm a thug-ass nigga, arms full of some taps\nGot a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back\nYou don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga\n\nWe'll put ten-a-piece on your whole crew\n\nWhat!\n",
