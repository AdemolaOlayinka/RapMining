Lil Wayne
The Leak
2007)
I hate gossip,
And I don't walking around looking for it ya know
But yesterday it seemed to just wonder around till it found me you know like
Gossip found me
Then why don't you try prove it
How?
You don't know how to prove it,
Well what you just you do is..
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
Stop hating on a nigga that is a weak emotion
The lady of a nigga
And You can get tip like you waiting on a nigga
Put a body bag in the apron on a nigga
I give my all behind the mic
But you could never see if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me
To win the title fight
But I'm gonna wear that championship belt so tight
and if I'm wrong there is snow white
And if I'm wrong there is no white
I'm trying to be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fucking po-lice
My flow is rare
These other rappers nice
These other rappers bark
Some of them even bite
Some other even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light
You just might might wanna
Think it over, think it over, ooo think it over baby
Stop!
Stop analyzing
Criticizing
You should realize
What I am is 'n start epitomizing
Legitimate
Got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident like fuck em all
Pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick so sick its like my shit is dyin'
It rains a lot in my city
Cause my city's cry's'
'cause my cities dyin''
But I emerge from all of that
I am a livin' pioneer
Zion
Fear god not them
Steer my robbin'' coupe through the streets to the booth and sue woop
Then I leave a tub in the booth
I leave a blood bath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth
Now where the drugs at
Like the strings on the shoe
No nigga fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot
Now Where new Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession
I must ask
Hey haven't I been good to you tell me haven't I been sweet to you
Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I wont even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I wont even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gonna need cheese if I'm makin' a ziti
You niggas want beef
I want a steak and a weevy
Lost in Amsterdam but Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga takin' it easy
All about my paper bout my paper like easy
why do rappers, why do rappers, lie to fans
Lot a rappers, lot a rappers lie like actors
Cut the mother fucking camera
Cut the check
Fuck your props
I AM hip hop
& i ain't dead I'm alive.
