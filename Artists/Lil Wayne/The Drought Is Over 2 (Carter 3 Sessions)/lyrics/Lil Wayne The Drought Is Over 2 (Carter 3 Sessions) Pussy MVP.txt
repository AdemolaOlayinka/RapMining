Lil Wayne
The Drought Is Over 2 (Carter 3 Sessions)
2007)
You're going to love me baby


Fresh checkerboard Vans and a t-shirt
And it's going down, but she first
My flow sweet, make my teeth hurt
I spit ice cream bars, thats dessert
To me theres no such thing as a G-1st
Ya, my feature price high like a mink purse
I smoke a whole reef of the reefer
Drugs are bad but I beg to defer, sir
I just take a look at her face
So she can see that my shades are Versace, and she purr
Cause I'm a cool cat per say
So I give her my life and now I got 8, word
She asked me to go over her place, I said sure
She said shes been horny all day, I got the cure
I'm on her like turf
Now bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass hurr Ya Digg


I, I, I Don't know that you been told
But I can tell you something 'bout me
I smoke weed, I drink, and I roll
Now is you fucking with me
Now I can't tell shit 'bout the next man
But he ain't got nothing on me
Cause after a pill and half and a shot of Patrone, I'm a Pussy M.V.P.
