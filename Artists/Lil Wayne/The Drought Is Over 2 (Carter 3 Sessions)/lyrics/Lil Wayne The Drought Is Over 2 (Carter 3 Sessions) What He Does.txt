Yea
But she always say
But she luv my style
Yea

N if I stay out late
I'm commin home rich
Thinkin bout that pussy
On the grind got me home sick
Them dolla signs on my mind got me on this
If I don't hustle then wat happens in the mornin?
Do the sun even rise?
Do the birds sing?
When I can stand ova the stove n make the birds sing
U think about that
I'll be right back
Ring
There she go baby come right back
Click
Ring
Then she call right back
Click 
Ring
I toss the phone in the back
Quick 
Think
Shyt u all I got
But if u leave me where u met me
Dat be on that clock
Gettin it
N when a nigga hittin it
U luvin
No cryin no fussin
Just as simple I'm commin
So when ya baby boy out there runnin
Dont cry 
Dont fuss
Its simple I'm commin

I kno what he does 
So in luv 
My baby
Dats my baby
Have his baby some day
N yes its been hard
So hard
Oooooo

Yea

N dat earth toner
She can smell the work on me
When I work on her
I see through that smerk on her
It hurts sort of
N I been n to deep since my first order
I just tell her don't expect the worst
She say she don't want to be stuck standing next to a nerf
I say I don't want to be stuck standing next to a curve
She said she don't wanna
I say shut up you pressing my nerve
She said who you tellin shut up
Then she get up
Start packing her shit up
Start calling her sister
Her sister dosn't pick up
The tensions start to pick up
She cryin, she got hick ups
I'm tellin her to cheer up
I'm layin down she say sit up
I sit up, she push me down I sit up
She push me down I get up
Then I act like I'm a hit her 
But I'm a better nigga 
She cant find a better nigga, naw

I kno what he does 
So in luv 
My baby
Dats my baby
Have his baby some day
N yes its been hard
So hard
Oooooo
N dats my baby
I luv him
I luv him yawl

I think about you when I'm riding dirty 
I say I love you when I left I hope you heard
In case I neva make it back I hope you heard me
In if you ever have twinz name them bright and early
Cause I'm out for the money I hope you down with it
No this ain't game but I'm found in it
And why be in it if I'm not gon win it
So ill be playin till the last minute, u don't get it
See that ground hurt when you hit it
I wouldn't lie baby
But fuck with me and you forever fly baby
So far from the buttom I swear
You can smell the work in the air, I'm there 
You can never take that from me
And what I been through you cant take back from me
If I offend you then mama get back from me
But if you love then I know you coming back for me, you love my style
