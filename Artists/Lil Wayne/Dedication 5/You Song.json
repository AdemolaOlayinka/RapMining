    "lyrics": "Shout to Chi-Town!\nDedication 5!\nSince oh five!\nKnow that!\n\nYou feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass\nWitchyo' fine ass\nYou fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cast\nYou the best dressed with ya breasts showin'\nLike a salad no dress-on\nTake ya to ya favorite restaurant\nAsk for the bread then fuck in the restroom\nThey don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room\nYou the best bride and I'm the best groom\nWedding presents got my best man\nAt the Best Buy buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom\nI'mma buy a summer house, with a rec room\nAnd a car with no backseat and some leg room\nAnd some strawberries and some chocolate\nAnd a fridge and some some broccoli\nCause I know you like vegetables even though I don't\nI won't say I won't eat it if you chef it\nFuck it I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched\nYou feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie\nWho's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy\nCoffee brown as the bosom I flew in on\nNose round like the wheels that my rims spin on\nLips full like the light on\nThe dash was flickin'\nOh wait it wasn't\nOh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven\nSo we can kick the butler out and we can make a muffin\nMaybe bake a dozen\nMy homeboy like yo sister maybe they can bake some cousins\nOoh isn't that sweet\nYou feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass\n\nThis is not a love song\nThis is a you song\nI just happen to love you\n\nGive you the world if it was for me\nMy diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lying through my teeth\nAnd now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds\nThinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile\nI get mental flashbacks of you asscrack\nLemme get back on track...\nYou say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act\nBut anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it\nSorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer\nAnd when you say I love you, I stutter \"I-I-I love you too\"\nIt's Wayne's world, she say \"what is this world coming to?\"\nAnd she know me and whoever together, she hope we come a loose\nShe told if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce\nI laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other\nThen she got serious, she said \"Tune I gotta ask you something\nDo you really love me?\" I tried to change the subject\nSo I said some crazy shit to her like: \"what if you and I were just letters?\nThat be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller\nBut I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket\nOkay that's a dead subject, you bring it up that's a zombie\nYou remind me, of my memory ain't what it used to be\"\nShe said she ain't tripping, I know cause I move my feet\nAnd when she figure out that she been swindled\nI'll be cleaning that love bird shit off my window\nI-I-I love you too...\n\n\nI mean how many times...How many times I gotta...How many times do I gotta say it for it to count? Are you counting? I loved the pictures. I needed that I swear I did. I was just thinking about you when you sent them too, you don't believe me. Ha, I know. D5. What up 5. I-I-I love you too. I do.\n",
