Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
Whats poppin'? Whaddup 5?
The problem with me is I believe in you too much
Whoo! Ya heard me? We in this bitch
Uh.. I don't really concider myself a living legend
Because uh... Sometimes legends aren't true
So... And sometimes I don't even feel like I'm living
So... To answer the question about what it is to be a living legend
Uh! Honestly I wouldn't know
But what it is to be Lil Wayne; its amazin' its awesome
I wouldn't give it up for the world
Ya dig?
