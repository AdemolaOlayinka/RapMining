Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
Uh, she say my dickhead need a crown on it
She say my cum tastes like holy water
She say she get hiccups just thinkin' of me
I said next time bring your drinkin' buddy
I told her, this that dedication 5
And anything else is a consolation prize
I said I'm cumming she say take your time
Yeah, I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom
And when she says "I Love You", I say shut up take this dick
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
And then he calls with all that bitchin', who is this?
She busy, call her later, now we switchin' positions
We in here getting creative
I put Champagne on her titties
Then sip it out her naval, boy
I live in, pussy
Let me speak to my neighbors I say
Clean the puke off of the toilet bowl
Treat the pussy like revolving doors
Ran outta rubbers at the corner store
She in my ear, like what you want them for
Well give me brains since you a smart aleck
Fuck her all night and don't smell her
Open her mind like a watermelon, haha, you jealous
I told her take her drawers off and she says I ain't wearin' none
I asked her who this pussy for, she said ransom
And when she says "I Love You", I say shut up take this dick
She treat me like a God and tell her man she atheist
He on that phone with all that bitchin', who is this?
She busy, call her later
Now we kissin' we twisted
My dick in a tornado
She say hit it, I hit it
I hit it raw like yayo
I admit it
(That fuckin' corner store man)
Uh, we makin' love like money
Yeah, yeah, like money
Like money
Told her this that Dedication 5
Dedication 5
I killed that pussy, it came back to life
I told her take her drawers off
And she said why you playin' dumb?
I asked her who this pussy for, she didn't answer
And she say ew, I love you
I said shut up take this dick
Would tell her say my name, but I gave her an alias
And oh my god she swallowed triggers
She gripped with hand that rocks the cradle
I'm so liquid? What is this?
This here a Dedication, it was scripted
Predicted, and shout out to my skaters
Boy, I live in pussy
Let me speak to my neighbors
I say
