Lil Wayne
Sorry 4 The Wait
2011)
Kush in the swisha
Money over bitches
Never kill a woman
Unless she is a witness
All about my business
Survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch I got the cash in a rubberband
I got the glock already cocked, boom!
Fuckin with a nigga meet my muthafucking goons
Sorry for the wait Carter IV coming soon
Light it up cause I'm a smoker
She tried to deep throat, I fuck around and choked her
It's Young Money mutherfucker game over
Shots leave ya body looking like ya doing yoga
And Lord knows I am a sinner pain pills for dinner
Bitch I am getting money like I got a money printer
I got a chopper and a trimmer shootin' like Jimmer 
You coming in that water boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout ya'll, sittin' in my hole
While Miss Anita Baker say you bringin me joy
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yell "fuck you bitch" and kept going
I'm on and that's right baby
And I ain't going out this bitch without a fight baby
One request please don't bite baby
I got some bomb ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I'm a shine like a nickel or a dime
And I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl stop talking that shit goin' suck a nigga dick
For a new outfit
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch I'm a still be high
I got faith in my weed man
But lil niggas got yay by the bean bag
Hit ya ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag
Yeah, all up in your fucking face
Tez pushed the album back, sorry for the wait
