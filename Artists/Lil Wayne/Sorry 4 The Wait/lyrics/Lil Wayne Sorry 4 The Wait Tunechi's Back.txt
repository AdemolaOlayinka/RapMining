Sorry 4 The Wait
2011)
Man, fuck these niggas
Tunechi's back, Tunechi's back
That's all these bitches screaming that Tunechi's back
All eyes on me
Nigga pict' how I'm rollin'
Strapped up with that mac
Masked up like a goalie
Mad my bitch on that coke
She snorted 4 on the bed
Now the bitch on me
She selling pussy and pay me
They sayin' Tunechi's back, Tunchi's back
And I bought them twins with me, nigga, click and clack
Lets go
Out on bail
Work on the scale
Put some change on ya head
Boy, you on sale
Yeah I see you in hell
Pop pop get well
Make breakfast cause I got you walking on egg shells
Zan with that lean
I ain't a beggin' muthafucka
But nigga please
And I aim this muthafucka at your memories
And all my niggas bloods but we make you niggas bleed
Yeah, bloody mary
I'm the one with the money so I ain't the one with the gun
All I do is give the word to the one with the gun
I'm triple OG, fugue splitting the sweet
Fuck bitches get money
Mission complete
Man fuck these niggas I ain't worried bout 'em
These niggas pure pussy, pull a pearl out em?
Yeah, I got a virgin I call her Madaonna
But I ain't trippin, her head is a monster
Yeah, we do this for real
Swear to God I never shoot unless I'm shooting to kill
Young wild muthafucka pop you and a pill
Boy instead of writing raps you should be writing your will
You a dead man, I get to poppin' this bitch
Watch where your head land
I ain't right I swear to God, I need my head scanned
Stand up and eat that pussy while she on a head stand
I'm a dog hoe, camo cargo's, semi auto's
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode
Yeah
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac
Sorry for the wait til my album drop...
