Lil Wayne
Tha Carter V
2017)
Tell me somethin' I don't know
I'm flexin' on 'em like torsos
These niggas slippin' like bar soap
These niggas listenin', use Morse code
Boy a nigga sippin' like parched throat
Excuse me
These niggas talkin' that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feelin' on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I said five bricks with four chicks
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow white we snowed in, nigga miss me with that hoe shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that, and watch everybody I toast with
Kill everybody you close with, Just don't stick your nose in
My bullshit cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him
Yeah, I got my mind right, and my money right, my head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a lil' blurry but It's stayin' on my quarter
And we find out moms address and your head get mailed over
Nigga you make that bed you lay in that bed
Or get that bitch made over
Tunechi

You so cray, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
They say Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi, Tunechi
You so cray, bitch
Tell me something I don't know, I'll tell you something I do know
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho
Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in Juco
We'll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don't get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes-kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I'm in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys
Tell the cops we don't name drop that's like dropping newborns
Nigga you crazy
You so cray, Tunechi
These hoes made
Nigga tell me somethin' I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven't seen
And give me what help Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I've never been, but not to where I'll never be
And I ain't never scared but I'm scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit clean
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine

Tell me something I don't know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo
I'm music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge, psychopathic, so psychopathic
Nigga give me credit on my balance
Lil Tunechi
(And I bump my head when I stand up)
