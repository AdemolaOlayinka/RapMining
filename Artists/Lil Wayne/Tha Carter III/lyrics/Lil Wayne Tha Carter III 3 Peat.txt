Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm tryna lose my gut
Fuck is up beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffeled up for the fuck of it
Shit get on my level you can't get on my level
You would need a spaceshuttle or a ladder that's forever
However I'm better if not now than never
Don't you ever fix ya lips unless you bout to suck my dick
Bitch swallow my words taste my thoughts
And if its too nasty spit it back at me
Two more inches I'd been in that casket
According to the doctor I could of died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic

I got her out the hood and put her in the hills
Yeah when I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough I got Miss. Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen I told my mom we will see better days
And sure enough we did exactly what I say
I told my girl when you fuck me better fuck me good
Cause if another girl could she gonna fuck me good
No sittin at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like its nothing to it
