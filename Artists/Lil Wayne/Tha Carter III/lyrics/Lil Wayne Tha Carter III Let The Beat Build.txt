Yea
I see you big bro
I'm gonna kill these niggas man
Yeah
Ha ha... straight off the block with it
Eagle street to be specific
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting
'cause I don't wanna finish
They diminish I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world hoe
I wear bright red, like a girl toe, no homo
Fingernail dirty, I been counting dirty money since 12:30 A.M. weigh them,
if they short take them right and back spray him amen
Yea, I can do my wayne,
And everytime I do it, I do my thang
Yeah believe that like a true story
Rims big make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'll be suicide, no back seats
Call it paralyzed
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
you see I handle mine I dismantle mine
I told her tool box, bitch it's hammertime
So excuse me as I nail 'em, toss and scale 'em, just repel 'em
I'm gonna kill 'em, someone tell 'em I'm gonna kill 'em
I'm gonna fill 'em up, his mama can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'm gonna kill 'em and resell 'em
I know you smell 'em
If you want it, you can just yell it
Three in the morning at your telly
Whole key go for 20, half a key go for 11
After me there will be nothing, I am legend
And I'm Will Smith
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
That's how you let the beat build bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
Let the beat build bitch
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom,
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Now say it (yeah)

Come on just a snare in the 808
Weezy baby on the mic, DOA
OK I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga diesel for giving me this diesel
Like a F-350, tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stank boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'm gonna take it 1, 2 way back
Like a silk wifebeater and a wavecap
Or the wave pool at Blue Bayou
And I waved fool as I blew by you
Hello how are you, I can buy you, but I wouldn't try you
Feed you to pyru
I know what I'm doing, I show improvement, show improvement
And I know just to go into it, can never amount to going through it
But whatever how you want to do it, we can do it
Like we lay ay wait, weezy let me just get the 808....
As I hit the kill switch...... now that's how you let the beat build bitch

That's how you let the beat build bitch
That's how you let the beat build bitch
Let the beat build bitch
(yeah, yeah, yeah)
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom,
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom

Now everybody say yeah
And I am the best rapper alive
I am the best rapper alive
And I will eat you alive,
Then I will get in a nigga chest
Like a bunch of phlegm
Like a fucking ram, I'm a hook, I'm a lamb,
I'm gonna dump a man in a dumpster can
You ain't a soldier ask Uncle Sam
Hair nappy like Pam
Nigga fuck your plan fuck your man
You ain't a pimp, unless you get the same bitch
Fuck your man, and fuck your plan
And all my bitches know that's my plan
Oh got damn, there's my sam-ple
Play it like that's my band
Gotta get it cleared
Suck my dick with red lipstick
And don't let it smear
And I got a lot tattoos
And I meant every tear
And I'm still on that street shit
Back to the beat bitch

That's how you let the beat build bitch
Now that's how you let the beat build bitch
Let the beat build and say (yea, yea)
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Now everybody say it...yea
And the beat goes boom, boom, boom, boom
It goes boom, boom, boom, boom
The beat goes boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom
Now say it (yeah, yeah)
