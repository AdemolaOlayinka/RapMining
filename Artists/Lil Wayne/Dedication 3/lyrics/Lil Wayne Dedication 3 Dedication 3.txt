Young veteran, soon to be OG 
Plus I spit like a crack head wit no teeth 
I hear you lil niggaz barkin', want more beef 
You like a nigga wit no guns, you gets no piece 
And when it comes to money my shit is obese 
Like della reece, I need celery 
Mo' money wat the fuck these niggaz tellin' me 
Im young Lucifer 
Take um all to hell wit, Ya 
Drop um off in a fire storm 
Why young squad get a riot on 
If he testify like common see the fire bomb 
If you know whats best muthafucka get yo quite on 
These niggaz starving out here getting they diet on 
While im eatin nigga grippin on my styrofoam 
One man game nigga ima die alone 
For now im wit ya girl getttin my ride a ride pipa on 
 
Willie the kid pull guns like a hamstring 
No bull I push pro v's like Pantene 
Blow like a trombone 
Funny niggaz tambourine 
Playaz get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine 
Gators day, they say its mascara wearas 
And my niggaz on paper getting paper like ball playaz 
No blood no foul, ya my heart cold is moscow 
We NAPA kill like a hot towel 
All my hoes hostile 
Not me, never tell me not now 
Rap niggaz forty cal tell ya brow 
Roof remover 
We leave your brain with more air 
Maneuver, I leave your bitch wit a moist chair 
Seduce her, ya 
You rappers should be tired of lyin' 
But I know its hard like a tire iron 
But yet it complex like its Mayan science 
Or Aztec math 
Crazy as a mess tab 
I feed niggaz like a mess hall 
And yes y'all 
Its Willie I address y'all 
Or like a stylist 
Nobodies fly is this 
You crazy, im getting brain like a psychiatrist 
 
And Ima Keep fuckin this word til ya muthafuckaz come fo' me (ya) 
Don't worry if I gotta gun, you should have a gun for me 
And all these niggaz is killaz and all these killaz wit me 
But you should be afraid of me 
 
Cuz Ima kill um 
Ima kill um 
Ya ima kill um 
Yes Ima kill um 
And ima kill um

Ima kill ummummu 
 
They say powder makes you hyper 
Reefer makes you calm 
Cigarettes give you cancer 
Well  make you dawg 
While I sip the purple harlot 
Thick as my sudden drawl 
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no drawers 
They got bats up in the cave 
Upside down blood rushin' to they head 
They reactin off a sound as I stand on the mound 
Pitchin for the crown 
Uptown bound face painted like a clown 
Reciting scriptures from the chapters 
Proverbs leviticus 
Old ass rappers complainin what the business is 
Bout the state of hip 
Soundin like some bitches hop yo ass up off a rich nigga, dick 
Its ridiculous the new school nigga 
What you need to do is become a resident 
Under the condition 
Get yo ass up off your ass 
And get your ass up on a mission 
Become some competition 
Like better run the dog 
Young money nigga we ball 
Like kobe or chris paul 
For giving a whack cracker 
Still sippin crystal 
Wavin the lifeline 
Since lifes a bitch y'all 
Raisin up the skirts of jezzebels 
For no cash like 
"bitch give me that ass' 
Or pulling up to the lot like 
"give me that jag" 
No pulling up to the lot like 
"give me that lam" 
They study me ? 
Cram like im a final exam 
If I hit you in your back 
You'll need a spinal exam 
Im something like a rhino or ram 
Animal,beast 
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia,yeast 
YM mulisha you niggaz better retreat 
Or be like this beat 
R.I.P. deceased 
 
Cuz Ima kill um 
Ima kill um 
Ya ima kill um 
Yes Ima kill um 
And ima kill um 
Ima kill um 
Ima kill ummummu 
 
Ya already, ya better call every paul barry in ya area the ball carrier gon get popped 
If I'm comin 'round the block the in swing drive gets stopped 
He gon drop like a flop 
On the court I love sports 
That's why I play my bitches cuz I got game 
That's why you pay my bitches (Yaay) 
Same hustle no money 
Im just hip hop they like two bunnies 
Who run it, bitch nigga muaaw 
That was French, nigga not 
A kiss, nigga nah 
No homo, rappers get ate like 4 on 4 
They say I fucked so and so 
And I be like so, so and so 
Nike's on they neck, they like let me breathe 
Im sorry but I cant piss how we feed 
This is why we hot 
This is how we freeze 
To fast to follow 
This is why we lead 
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Jeezy 
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave 
Ya know we tote steal, this is how we ease 
You can get the steal if you try these thieves now 
Glass needa Swisha let me climb these trees 
And im haters say we couldn't this is why we bees 
This shit like puddin', puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' 
Puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' 
Puttin' it down like gravitys pullin' me to the ground
