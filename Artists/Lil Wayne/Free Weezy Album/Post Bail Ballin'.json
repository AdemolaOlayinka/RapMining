    "lyrics": "Hundred thousand on a small ass chain\nHundred thousand on a bottle champagne\nHalf a million for a watch with no diamonds\nBrought cash to the jewelers, still had change\nOoh, sharks in the crib and in the back yard\nElevator in the house, never got stuck\nI just looked in the mirror, got star struck\nI just looked at your bitch and got eye fucked\nWho the fuck wanna race? Put your money up\nAll you see is license plates, far in front of you\nI gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life\nShe licked her lips twice and told me I'm yummier\nGlass house on the block, 5 floors in it\nGot a picture on the wall that costs more than it\nYou observing it, I'm absorbing it\nJudge mad cause a nigga make more than him\nIgnoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims\nI'm going in until I'm pourin' in more than M's\nI'm courting in swimsuit models that don't know who I am\nIn foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films\nMy warrant clear as day like Doris is\nWhen I ain't trippin', my lawyers is\nSo what the charges is? Put it on my tap, baller shit\nI'm from the cell to the mall with this\nNow tell them motherfuckers sign\nI'm post bail ballin', post bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'\nPost bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm\nSoon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley\nI'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary\nAnd I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary\nThen give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it\nOne time for the hustlers and the young moms\nMy presidential is crunch time, looking in my son's eyes\nOnly time I see a upside\nI tell him he gon' be a tough guy and never be a punchline\nTell him never wait in one line, tell him not even a lunch line\nPray more than some times\nWhen the cops come you tongue-tied\nTake dirt, make a mud pie\nLookin' out the window, in the coupe with a bimbo\nTalking 'bout who she resemble\nBitch you in a Enzo, stop being so simple\nNow fuck me like we in a limbo\nI ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill\nI got ocean views, I got water bills\nI got cards to deal, i got hearts to steal\nI got larger wheels on my automobile\nI lost appeal, the bullshit cost me a mil\nIt brought me to tears, I came home and brought me a crib\nI walked through that bitch, strapped when it's dark in that bitch\nAnd through hell and high water, I just walk through that bridge\nI got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge\nI started to swig, but ended up drinking all of that shit\nCause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit\nI step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out then pen\nMy nigga I'm, I'm post bail ballin, post bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'\nPost bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'\nFarewell warden, I'm post bail ballin'\nGo tell the warden I'm, post bail ballin'\nInmate Carter, post bail ballin'\nSoon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley\nI'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary\nAnd I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary\nThen give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it\nSoon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley\n",
