Lil Wayne
Free Weezy Album
2015)
That's how I raised em' lord, them niggas crazy

D-boy D-boy D-boy
My pockets look Keloid
My dead presidents reborn
When I'm naked I got three arms
Got a big house with a green lawn
Got a cigar full of neon
Like my ho cold and my tea warm
Close this casket he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick

I got J's at my door
I got shooters on my team
I got feds down my throat
Counting money dirty and clean
Smokin nothing but Irene
Got a bitch with good hygiene
I'm sick with it no vaccine

I got coke under my nails
I got niggas takin them L's
Nigga, we don't need no scale
I'm sick with it no get well
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man please don't shoot
Bout it, bout it, bout it like T-R-U
Young nigga ridin in a V-1-2
Chop bricks like karate, judo, kung fu
Like jiu-jitsu split a brick in two

You do you I'ma do what it do
Niggas dropping dimes in a 2-6-2
Bout it, bout it, bout it like hoody hoo
Started from the bottom, and I grew into
Everything I'm driving is new improved
When she fucking with me it's a new experience
Fucking with you it's a new excuse

Nigga who is you
I looked in the mirror said, "Ooh it's you"
All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordan's
My shoe get checks like swoosh
Hear you niggas talking about what you going do
Or might do, I invite you
I entice you, but I advise you
Not to god bless you like achoo
Police find you in the bayou with your friends by you
With your shit knocked loose
Nigga that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu
I been piru I'm in my mood
So you know what you can do

Fuck nigga pull up, I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga good luck, yeah, I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga pull up

Fuck nigga pull up, fuck nigga pull up
I'll be waiting with my muhfuckin foot up
I ain't even stood up, fuck nigga good luck
Fuck nigga put up or muhfuckin shush up
Fuck nigga pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like fuck nigga what up, fuck nigga shook up
I been out here since P had the hook up
So if you wanna meat, nigga I'm a butcher
If you want beef, nigga I'm a butcher
My niggas wanna eat, nigga I'm a cook ya
If you with your bitch and your bitch want me
Nigga I'ma pull up like a trigger and she's the bullet
We the illest, we the coolest
We the illest, we the coolest
The sickest and the smoothest, the gifted and the goofiest
Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture I'ma zoomin
I'ma hit em, I'ma lose em, I'ma kill em, I'ma bruise em
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover
I come at you when I'm moving, the bitch I'm with bad
I'ma pinch her in her booty and bitch it's Lil Tunechi
Aw yeah aw yeah fuckin right

Always had my gun in fights
Always had the upper hand
You the always call your brother type
Hard head all my fuckin life
Whole world in my fuckin hand
Damn my girl just pulled up
Will pull out to my bubble plan
But fuck it man like what you sayin
Look, I'm not sayin but I'm just saying

Fuck nigga pull up, I'll be waiting
Lord knows I'll be waiting for you
Me and my young niggas
That's how I raised em

Fuck nigga pull up
My young niggas stood up
Like fuck nigga what up
Blookah, blookah, blookah
I say, fuck nigga pull up
I'll be waiting with my foot up
Fuck nigga good luck
Blrrt, blrrt, blrrt

I say fuck nigga pull up
Fuck around and never pull off
They see the guns we pull out
Say never mind and pull off
They see the guns we pull out
Say never mind and keep going
I put the gun in his mouth
I say be quiet and breath soft
Shifty eyes I see four
Flip them pies like DDOS
These bitches tired they sleepwalk
Brilliant mind I'm street smart
And deep thought, and we are
What she want, and she want
And he don't, but keep on and we gone see
Fuck nigga pull up 
I'll be waiting
While you waiting nigga
Fuck nigga pull up

Me and my young niggas
That's how I raised em lord
