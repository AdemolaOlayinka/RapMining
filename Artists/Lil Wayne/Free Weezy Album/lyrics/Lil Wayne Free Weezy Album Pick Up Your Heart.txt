She on her back screaming she love me
And I'm in her pussy thinking about money
I done forgot what all my old hoes look like
But they see me with my new bitch make them miss the good life
I move to Cali had to leave the beach alone
And you could call me what you want, just don't call me on speaker phone
And the good die young and the great live forever
Go see your memory bank teller cause you done forgot who put this shit together
Wait bitch
I hop in my Phantom and drive to my phone start roaming
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment
Please pardon my rest room but Tunechi got the longest shit list
My pockets are pregnant they up early with morning sickness
I swear I been through so much but that's life I get high it don't phase me
They ask how do you sleep at night I reply like a baby, bitch
I been outchea doing me by myself nigga no special features
Its all about the Benjamin no disrespect to Aretha
But I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby
Cause this game fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody
Got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby
Cause these streets fuck everybody, these streets fuck everybody
Gotta get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
Got to get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no
But I got to get my paper baby
Perfect attendance on the block I'm booming
When it's cold, when it's rain, when it's muggy, when it's hot, when it's humid
I walk into the corner store feeling like a king
World on my back shit feel like a mink
Mad at some motherfucker dropped my pill down the sink, hold up wait
I got xanax, I got percocet
She give me pussy and her income tax
I send my goons to rob the dope man
They bring it back now I'm the dope man
Suitcase, dead body in the suitcase
Molly in the Kool-aid, we put molly in the Kool-aid
I'm still watching boot legs cause I can't go to the movies
Cause I'm bigger than the actors in the movies
Me and your bitch made a movie
I'm on a new wave
I been wilding in these streets mamma but still remember everything you said to me
Don't believe these hoes they be lying through they teeth mamma toothache
Oh lawd, I got to get that paper
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more no
Wait bitch
I hop in my Bentley and drive until my phone start roaming
Lord I don't want to talk to nobody I want my moment
I use to be fun loving now I'm a gun loving killer
But these niggas made me like this
Now they all afraid of they own invention
I walk with a limp cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight
I come to a stage in my life and I just can't let my life move me upstage
Tuxedo on and a cummerbund, finger crossed behind my back
On the corner watching my money come
Cause I got to get that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby, that paper baby
Cause this game fuck anybody, this game fuck everybody
Got to get my paper baby, my paper baby, my paper baby
Cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up bae, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up wait, I don't want to do it no more no
Hold up baby, I don't want to do it no more
I wear black cause I can't find nothing else to wear
I wear dreadlocks cause I can't do nothing else to my hair
I kiss you cause it just happen
I do what I do cause it got to be done
But I guess I oughta take credit for something
Yesterday I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there today, I really hope she go away
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
I don't want to do it no more no)
Cause you know sometimes that last doesn't happen at first
I'm the pimp and the problem
She said you don't think of me when I know you think too much
(I don't want to do it no more
These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't want to do it no more)
She said I think you think I think you think of us
(I'mma get this paper baby, I'mma get this paper baby)
She said she wanted sprinkles I said sprinkles are for winners
