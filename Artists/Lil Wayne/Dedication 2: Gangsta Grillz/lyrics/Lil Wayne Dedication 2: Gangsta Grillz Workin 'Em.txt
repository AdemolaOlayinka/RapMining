Dedication 2: Gangsta Grillz
2006)
That's why you bitch won't a real nigga like me 
She want to give that pussy to a real nigga like me 
I be pimping them hoes, I be pimping them hoes, I be pimping them hoes pimp pimping them hoes
I be working them bitches, I be working them bitches, I be working them bitches work working them bitches


Weezy F. Baby the motherfucking carter,
Bitches on my stick put my name in Harry Potter
They think I'm very hotter, you girl say the same,
and since we like to travel, she lets us run a train
And my deep hits put me in the hall of fame,
I make her turn over everytime we play the game
Your boy Wayne, ask them niggas I came
in a Ferrari, Jaguar switching both lanes
Living room, in the kitchen, on a plane,
I get from A to B so comfortable I
Do my thang you all niggas so plain,
I'm so fly call me soul plane




To him I'm a killer, to her I'm a lover
I always wear a mask, and I always wear a rubber
Yeah I'm from the hood, but my crib in the suburbs
They love a nigga VIBE, so that's why I got the cover
My nigga mac maine is like a brother from another,
We're from the same hood, we will kill a motherfucker
We eat your niggas lunch, and to bitches I'm supper
She ask me to go down, I'm like as long as I fuck her
I wear I lot of diamonds, see baby I'm a stunner,
so ride a niggas dick, ah, baby bear hummer
And homie you can have her cause I don't really won't her, you put the dick in her I put the dick son her




I'm hotter than firer, she wetter than a bitch
These niggas really pussy, and I'm harder than my dick
I show to much love for you to be a hatter,
I ain't home everyday but I'm getting my paper
I know what's going on 'cause I'm creator,
and since I'm so early holla at um later
I sound like sex coming through the fadder,
(BITCH) I'm the president not the mayor
