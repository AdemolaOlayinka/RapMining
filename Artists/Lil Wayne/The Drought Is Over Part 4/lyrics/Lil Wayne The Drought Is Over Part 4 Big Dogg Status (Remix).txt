Lil Wayne
The Drought Is Over Part 4
2007)
Young Face slangin, Ya Ya Ya
Heavyweight, Got a bad bitch in every state
On the grind, nonstop till I touch this cake
Mark ass niggas, stay the fuck up out my way
I be true O.G., you can quote what I say
I'm a H-town nigga from around the way
Southside, ridin' dirty like I'm UGK
Asshole by nature like my name was Tre
And I don't gangbang, I control the Game
What I'm representin' here's puttin' holes in brains
Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey
For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street with it, dun asked that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I rollover rodents with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em
I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s
A straight up pussy, he claims he knows me
See I puttin out these VVdees
Let my shit hit the streets, he got to squat to pee
Got them eggs on these beams, so they watchin' me
Might trap for a rat, pussy watch and see


I been straight for a long time
Gettin' checks for a long time
Gettin' Jake for a long time
E&J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G, for a long time
Been in the streets, for a long time
Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status


It's your price, but I ain's scared
It's my pleasure to say it right, don't think I ain't said
They got prices on my, nigga I don't slip
Clips longer than giraffe necks, that's why I don't trip
Just open up and let em rip, nothing new to a G
Hey, I ain't worried about these niggas, till they shoot at me
My partner died, daughter too, your excuses to me
Still a busta ass rapper I'm refusing to be
Scarface seem to think I'm the king,
You're a fool if you think,
There's another new, young rapper dude out there that's cooler than me
I choose in the V, brand new with the beat
I live real life like I say I do in the beat
Yeah, true indeed I do indeed
Do it for the O.G.s and the true MCs
Them bustas say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
But the fightin' in the club, I'm done with all that
Nigga, his ass out of line, then his ass gettin' whacked
Give a west-side 10 stacks and that's that
But maybe less as a matter of fact
Nigga don't be testin' the professor, What's the matter with cats


I been straight for a long time
Gettin' checks for a long time
Gettin' Jake for a long time
E&J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G, for a long time
Been in the streets, for a long time
Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status


I Been doing this shit, nigga who are you
Little nigga I done seen keys bigger than you
Nigga, you ain't know shit,
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
How the game go
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yardfish (What the hell is this)?
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yardfish (What the hell is this)?
Yaaahhhh!


Came here to exercise my game
Spreadin' love to the hood's, how I do my thang
Smokin' with my homies, barbecuing them wangs
Sip hennesy and coke, cause I don't fuck with dranks
Hoe pop pills either cause that shit ain't coll
We just drunk and mad dawg fo we went to school
Lik off, back then I was smashin' boys
Jump wrong, you saw a nigga get his ass destroyed
Same rules right now, I demand respect
If I slap one hoe, then her man's is next
I'm a kick door robber, A hot shot driver
A crack rock slingin muthafucka for a dollar
If you dare to be laid, then off in the acky
But if it ain't no way, then best believe I'm take it off a
A Nigga with no hustle, it ain't work it yet
And a bitch like that is even worse than death
Out in the hood bullshittin' is what this game can cost him
And if a nigga can't maintain mane he lost it
Be a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard
As a nigga, I'm up in here with my balls and my word


I been straight for a long time
Gettin' checks for a long time
Gettin' Jake for a long time
E&J for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me
Been a G, for a long time
Been in the streets, for a long time
Toting heat, for a long time
Nigga, try to get like me

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status

I got Big Dogg Status, I got Big Dogg Status
