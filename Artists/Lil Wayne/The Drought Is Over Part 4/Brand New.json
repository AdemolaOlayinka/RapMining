Who me? Click-Clack, blast 'em\nChrome 24's tires thin like napkins\nGotta ride big cuz i am like a captain\nYou know i'm a boss, chillen, relaxin\nProbably in my office, doin' my taxes\nYou little niggas so not in my bracket,\nAnd I don't even have time to practice\n\n\n\n\nI got ice, ridiculous price\nYour camera has never saw a picture this nice (Hmm)\nI'm fishin and the bitches will bite\nIt's prolly cuz my game is fixin in tight, Right\nI'm fuckin every bad bitch twice\nAnd if she does'nt wear panties then I'll fuck her on sight\nI'm nasty like spice\nI know what she likes\nI can make a black women scream like she white\nI can make a white women scream like Mike\nBut before she start singin', she gotta check my Mic\nNiggas just hatin'\nAnd I dun lost sight\nIt's like i don't see 'em I only see the night\nYou talkin that shit but you boys just hype\nI hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight?\nLouis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe\nYou think you fresh, Nigga I'm ripe\n\n\n\n\nBrand new coupe, drivin' crazy then the mother's\nSittin' low in the seats with the burner sittin' under\nGot my tank top toppe on it\nProlly ain't summer\nBut I ride like that cuz I'm hotter than the others\nDamn, theres no keepin up with the brother man\nI can spell my name in burnt rubber\nI'm gone\nLeave me alone\nNow the dog is at supper\nYou can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard\nI'm so far ahead of them suckers\nIm gonna have to start rappin' in numbers\nI promise the flows don't stop they come rappin like thunder\nI bet you hide under your covers\n",
