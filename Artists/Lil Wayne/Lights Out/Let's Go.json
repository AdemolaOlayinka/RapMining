(Look)\n\nNigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat\nI got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack\nAnd I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac\nJust in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest\nIf I don't know shit, I know cars and broads\nI done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off\nAnd I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars\nTo them dog hoes, nigga, we scream \"fuck 'em all!\"\nI hustle hard in these city streets\nI got my block on fire with my HB's\nSpinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r\nCook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard\nAnd you can find me\nRight up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'\nGot the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'\nNigga know one thang: its some uptown shit\nIf a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch\n\nNigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat\nI got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack\nWell let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga\nCuz if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga\nLook, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top\nI got a blunt, and a glock, and a bag of rocks\nLet's go nigga, let's slide nigga\nIf you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga\n\nBetter pay attention now so you don't forget later\nI run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper\nDon't make me take ya, play ya\nI cock the glock and spray ya\nCall it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka\nAnd J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready\nMake me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy\nGot them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known\nI cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone\nThen I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls\nSupply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off\nLock the spot down\nRespect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over\nNow cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders\nI take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever\nNigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend\nYou see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed\nRats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me\n\n\nSee I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler\nYou can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya\nSome of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh\nNone of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya\nNiggas can't hold me down, wodie wild\nCuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds\nThey show me how to cook that brown and rock that white\nNo school, put that book back down, pick up that knife\nSee that's the real reason I hate to be on tour\nI'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure\nNiggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song\nBut yall gon' twist it and end up all gone\nDog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers\nI pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle\nSo stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere\nI'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere\n",
