That commitment if - I don't get it somebody gonna die tonight -\nI know my vibe is tight - And I deserve the throne - if the kid ain't right - then let me die in his souls.\nI'll be riding (jis)\nRiding alone\nwith my daddy on my mind like you gotta be kidding\nHow the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?\nSometimes I wanna drop a tear but no emotions from a king\nShall be\nSo I be who I be\nThat's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and\nPlease say the motherfucking\nSo I be who I be\nThat's me, that's Weezy F. Baby and\nPlease say the motherfucking\n\n\nBaby you gotta know that I'm just out here doing what I gotta do for me and you and we eating\nSo bitch\nWhy the fuck is you tripping?\nI'm taking these chances\nMy head to the sky\nMy feet on the ground\nMy fingers to the judge if the money don't move\nAnd I won't budge\nWon't budge\nNo I won't budge no\nNall\n\n\nMoney is the motivation\nFacing the avenue\nBack touchin' the wall\nGot the weed\nGot the gun\nGotta run wen I hear that bird call (birrr) dang\nHop in that thing and merk off\nswerve off\nyou know me, they call me Birdman Jr.\nNe body murderer\nBirdman sponsor it\nPhantom of the opera\nAll black - clock tent - locked in\nI can let them shots out\nyou can't get no shots in\nBullet proof\nLeave a nigga with a bullet proof\nShoot you in your mouth and call it bullet tooth\nI'm like what they do\nWhat to do\nThere's a full court\nPressure I'm just going for the two\nIf I'm open for the three\nI'm gonna take it in a second\nEven if there's one second and\nI'm gonna make it. It's nothing\nI don't take it for granted\nI don't take it for nothing.\nI take it for what it is worth to the durf motherfucker\n(yeah)\n\n\n\n\nI ain't never killed nobody I promise\nI promise if you try me\nyou gonna have to rewind this track and make me go back, that nigga go that\nThat boy will lay flat so flat\nThat act is what I perform amongst you haters\nGot Nina in my palm and I'm masturbating (black)\nPeter Pan flies 'til I die what you saying\nBaden ape, Yves Saint, Evisu is what I stand\nGot me feelin' like Scarface, like the Koheba\nStreets reply I look right in the for seater\nYou know I be out here riding the for seater\nTop floor of the for Seasons four of them whores\nAnd they all know how to cook it up\nAnd look I got some\nAnd only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up\nSee it's a cold world so homey bundle up\nWe ain't on this grind for nothing\nNow get you hustle up\n",
