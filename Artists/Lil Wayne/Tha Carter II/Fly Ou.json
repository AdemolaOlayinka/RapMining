HaHa.Yea\n\n\nI got the game on ball and chain\nI threw the key in the train\nI'm like the key in the truck\nI spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless\nSeeing through you niggaz like a fuckin psychic\nHearing through the grapevine, niggaz wanna hate mine\nSay my name and die in the daytime\nYou catch my drift, man you better be Peyton\nBoy the heats on, they make a peace bond\nI'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign\nStraight frowns, no daps, strapped three times\nA Tec-11, AK 47, one Beretta, ready for whatever\nTell them pussy niggaz come together\nHeavy wetter, nigga super soaker wetter, nigga\nSix feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga\nI'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga\nThirty years old, shit that'll be a different nigga\nQuit it Wayne, your Mom is listenin\nBut she ain't really trippin, 'cause the pots is pissed in\nThem niggaz trippin, until the shots whistling'\nHear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention\nI gotta bitch, and quit callin women bitches\nAs long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen\nNo preventing the crime, I gotta get it\nI'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin\nThere you go shittin on a way a nigga thinkin\nOnly history I know is Benjamin Franklin\nAnd since the future ain't promised to no one\nI live everyday like this is the sure one\nTrain in the tidal wave, this is the ocean\nStand in the heat, 'til the mother fuckin snow come\nAnd it feels so fuckin good\nThrow my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull\nNo hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches\nRunnin cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune\nCome and get it, automatics in motion\nWe bangin for the bread nigga, even the molded\nI got my loaf, I got my toast\nChaperone of the south, I got my coast. Yea\nAnd until I die I'm Da. Da Da Da Da. Da BEST RAPPER ALIVE\n",
