BOOM!\nYoung Tune the big kahuna\nIt's my ocean baby you all niggas is tuna\nBetter now than sooner junior\nFly around you city try tryna take a number two on you\nI ain't going nowhere special I won't never leave\nShit I'm already a legend if I ever leave\nGame get rid of me? Not little me\nMan I got 'em I'm gonna get 'em B (I got 'em B)\nI'm hungry like I didn't eat\nI want it like I didn't see a mill before seventeen\nWhat the fuck you niggas telling me?\nYou pups can't keep up with the Pedigree\nCatch me where the weather be somewhere in the seventies\nCall myself settling palm trees Promethezine but what's new?\nSometimes I can't cut through that rough loop\nGet fucked so many times 'til it's fuck you (fuck 'em!)\nSo how you wanna do it baby we can get it\nAll you gotta do is say it and I'm with it\nMoney and murder you my nigga my jelly preserver\nI'm gonna ride baby 'til the judge give me a verdict yeah\nHear me or heard me I get it and serve it\n'cause everytime I did it I hit it and hurt it yeah\nNow I kill it the mission accomplished\nThe niggas abolished the bitches astonished\nThen they pay homage when did they find it but\nNow that they know it's a must I remind 'em so\nThey don't forget it I underline it and\nI'm in the sky when the thunder's crying young'n\nI been through all that I done done what you saying\nI put it down when the other was playing\nWhen the jungle was open I rolled in with the riders\nStole food from the bears and bought it back to the lions\nQuote unquote with the eighth I'm a gorilla but lighter\nWith the eye of a tiger the heart of a fighter yeah\nStart 'em, ignite 'em I walk through fire\nWatch the flames start multiplying whoo! Yeah\nAlter a nigga nina talk to a nigga\nTake a chunk ouch body like a shark bit a nigga\nI'm awkward like Cartwright fuck with a nigga\nShot ugly but my arch right come on dog bark bite\nFork in the road I'm always going right\nNowadays knowing life ain't no more road lights\nWe can't see but we're gonna make it to the finish line\nIt's right there the goal line right behind the scrimmage line\nTouchdown check the scoreboard gimme mines\nSemi 9 fit me fine hit a nigga twenty times\nDamn then one more to the face (BOW!) just\nSo they close the casket like I pay to close the case\nI made straight mafia shit front line\nTop rank ready to die for my shit and the obvious shit\nIf I talk about my robbery they probably get rich\nSo fuck 'em I'm gonna let 'em sit\nAnd I ain't ducking 'cause I'm right here I'm just enough\nI don't care who at the top of the stairs I'm stepping up\nSee you fucking up the money baby that ain't good business\nYou starting to look like a witness and this is\nFor the gangsters and the bitches the hustlers and the hoes\nCrossover whatever mainstream no\n'cause Wayne thinks silent Wayne'll never fold\nYou heard it right here if the game was ever told\nLift up you toes and look under a rug\nTrust me there's history under all that dust\nSo deep down in the dirty there lies us (who?)\nYeah Cash Money Records and I'm still up front\nStunner pop a bottle baby peel us a blunt\nLets eat and talk about all them niggas we cut\nWhat? You know what? Let's not fuck up our lunch\nThat's real shit if you ever seen such\nChuch\n\nThe Mobb\nNigga\n",
