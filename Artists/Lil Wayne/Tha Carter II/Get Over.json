Take me\nI know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin\nBut I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin\nAnd the end is comin, but I ain't runnin\nI and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it\nI'm just speakin from the heart of the diein public\nWe still beatin, we gon rise above it\nThough it seem like they cheatin and we loosin\nWe survive if nothin, they could never take the stride from strugglin\nI gotta ride\nAnd sometimes that ride get bloody\nBut I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh..\n\n\nOhhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over\nit's almost over, and we gon be alright\n(I gotta get over, I gotta get over, cause bitch I'm a soldier)\n\n\nStraight Patrone out the bottle to the head now\nWe gettin read now, bitch my nigga dead now\nAnd all the things I never said, I gotta say it now\nI shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds\nNow I gotta walk around, brim down\nJust tryin to find my way to the next day, escape\nYa birthday could be ya death date\nSo I'm livin like it was just yesterday, let's pray\nTen fingers together, can't bring 'em together\nIt's murda murda, I don't think it get better\nSo be a competitor or get out the weather\nMe? I got a umbrella and a berretta\nI'm just tryin to make sure my daughter future progressin\nAnd behind that, I'm shootin excessive, trust me\nThe beautiful dead, we livin wit the ugly\nI just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin\n\n\nThooouugh, though I'm missin you\nI'll find a way to get through\nI know livin without ya is impossible\nGooonnee...I know you gon live on\nCuz you were my brotha and I love ya, and I miss ya\n(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over\nbut I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over)\n\n(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over\nbut I'm a soldier, so I gotta over\ncan't stay sober, I'm just tryin to get over)\n\nThey ask me why I wear shades at nighttime...cause I don't wanna see nothin! Yea..\nLike I said, life ain't nuttin but a long extended road, keep drivin\nI done passed up plenty people up on the side of road, no help, keep goin\nYea...Lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin...yep...\nwho knows when I'll run outta gas.
