Die bitch nigga die I hope you bleed a lake\nI'ma play x-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake\nI'm just tryin' to be the great, tryin' to get a piece of cake\nTake it offa your plate, eat it right in your face\nThey got a whole lot to say but I don't listen\nCall me automatic Weezy bitch I keep spittin', pow\n\n\nWith all these riches and, all these riches\nBut ain't no loaners around\nThey thinkin about shooters that-shooters that\nGuns-Girls-Ladies that-Gunners that\nShoot shoot shoot shoot shooter\n\nPut my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, shooter\n\n\nBut I'm not\nI just cry mama, I think they, hey\nMe think they want me to surrender (Shooter)\n\nAnd to the radio stations, I'm tired o' being patient\nStop bein' rapper racists, region haters\nSpectators, dictators, behind door dick takers\nIt's outrageous, you don't know how sick you make us\nI want to throw up like chips in Vegas\nBut this is Southern face it\nIf we too simple then y'all don't get the basics\n\n\nLady walks into a shotgun surprise\nDropped to her knees saw her life before her eyes\nHe said \"Bitch is gonna get it\", everybody gon regret it\nI'm your, shooter\n\nMy hands up, my hands up\nThey want me with my hands up\nOh, Shooter\n\n\nMe won't surrender, me no pretender\n\nSock soakin' wet I been runnin' y'all\nI reload, every hundred yards I'm comin' forward\nBetter know me, Lil Wayne just call me lord\nHard, take pain like Tylenols, raw\nWay past par, for, I'm some shit you never saw\nI take you to the shootout baby win lose or draw\nAnd then they ask who when where how\nAnd, my reply was simply pow!\n\nMama, I think they, hey, me think they want me to surrender\n(Shooter, my hands up, my hands up, they want me to surrender)\n\nNo, me won't surrender, no, no\nI promise no surrender\nI got my burner\nAnd I'm your shooter\n",
