Lil Wayne
Tha Carter II
2005)
So they ask me young boy what you gonna do the second time around
How you gon' come back I tried to told them
I come back like 32 I jump back like 33 (ugh)
Hit me it's nothing this is Tha Carter II people
This is Tha Carter II people (hey)


They call me Mr. Carter I kissed the daughter
Of the dead's forehead I killed the father
Spilled the heart of a mildew hater
I will put them body on chill like glaciers
Gracias I'm crazy yes it's obvious
Going against me is atheist
I got my angels on my shoulders and a quarter of that angel dust
I ain't sniffing I'm just pitching ya honor I ain't snitching ya honor
Hate bitch niggaz bitches with power
Vacate when the kitchen get hotter
I just sit on the counter open the cabinet close the cupboard
Put that jar in the skillet drop a 4 in the bubbles
I remember being young trying to hustle my dough
Trying to tell the old junkies that my crack ain't soap
Trying to tell you fool you chump that my mack ain't broke
You ain't trying to see how far that black backlane go
No call me Pacman you ghosts is blue
I got my red river rubies and my oceans blue
Jewelry usually I'ma hooligan for the money
Yeah I'm eating but I got a tapeworm in my tummy oh
Make harm in the bomb you in public
Hit you with the straight arm no warning nothing
Look it's morning no yawning or nothing
I ain't sleep and I'm up trying to take a nigga lunch
You gon' make a nigga break a nigga fronts
Then shake a nigga shorts and we taking what we want
I'm so 5-0-4 you got to kill me here
If you ever looking for me bitch I will be here
Cash Money is an army navy seal me here
Lot of niggaz ran from it but I'll still be here
No chrome on the continental I'm so fundamental
Crack the phill' crack the roof and roll up the window
And my hood love me they tell me bring it home
Thats why I holla Hollygrove on each and every song
You leaping at a dog a dog wit no bark
Just a bite like an old shark
And all you rich niggas know Pa
I'm talking 'bout stunna
He like keep ya door he got ya whole winters
Sunshines on the king and sets on the prince
I met the birdman and I been shining ever since like that
