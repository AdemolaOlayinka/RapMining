    "lyrics": "Uh, Umm, Weezy you all,\nYoung Money, Cash Money,\nThis is, Da Drought 3\nLadies and gentlemen, you all know me,\nYou know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas,\nMost likely I'm gonna die with my finger on the trigger,\nThey tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,\nI tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing\nMy eyes is so wide as he watching the skillet,\nI let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'm gonna kill her,\nI bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,\nAnd fuck you, hospital, young money, we're the illest,\nAnd I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest,\nMy flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,\nSelf made G, and them bitches know the business.\nRelying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,\nAnd when I was 5, my favorite movie was \"The Gremlins\"\nAin't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,\nYou looking for divine and the little intervention,\nAnd them birds don't fly, without my permission,\nI'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,\nOr maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,\nSee my world is different,\nLike Dwayne Wade,\nAnd if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing,\nAnd you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,\nMost likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,\nDon't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit\n'Cause the sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nAnd if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it\nThe sky is the limit,\nBuck Ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it,\nSwitching lane faster than she switch subject,\nTell a bitch don't talk to me,\nAnd if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,\nAnd I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,\n'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me,\nMy flow is art, unique,\nMy flow can part a sea,\nThe only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,\nBy any means, and you're just sardine,\nI got the 40 cal. Tuck in my p.r.ps.,\nWhat do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,\nAnd majority of my city is violence,\nThey tried to make a brand new map without us,\nBut the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,\nAnd no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,\nAnd I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,\nMost likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,\nDon't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nAnd I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,\nBecause the sky is the limit,\nYeah, the sky is the limit,\nAnd if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,\nCause the sky is the limit,\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,\nUse your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,\nRun up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa,\n(that's fucked up, ha ha)\nAnd you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,\nUse your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,\nMail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)\nAnd I'm a G,\nAnd you ain't gotta know the alphabet to see,\nI know that my whole city is depending on me,\nAnd I forget a lot of shit, but I can not forget the streets,\nSo you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,\nMost likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger,\nDon't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nDon't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it\nAnd tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,\nBecause the sky is the limit,\nYeah, the sky is the limit,\nAnd If you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,\n'Cause the sky is the limit,\nThey tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,\nI tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing\n'Cause the sky is the limit,\nHands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,\nCan you see me up there? The sky is the limit,\nThe sky is the limit,\nIf you don't know nothing about it, the sky is the limit.\n",
