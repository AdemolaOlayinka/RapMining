Lil Wayne
Da Drought 3
2007)
Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shortie
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon, I'm paid 


Give a woman none, uh-huh
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term
Well we get it how we live never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow 'cause you is concerned
Only down south rapper could've been in the firm
Or the commissioner of Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you want me ma
Nigga get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I want rings for my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
...Same triangle offense
I come through the lane like dargent
Refree niggas is lame they call charging
I have no brain I'm retarded
We are not the same I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late September whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"


See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you hear sometimes
But um um since I'm so bright I'm gonna put the spotlight on you baby


Show me what are you 'bout, lil daddy?
I know you need to stop, stop hating
I know what you not, wodie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunt's up now
Blaze 


Tell the world take six
Young dictionary make words make sense
Then, I make cents, make dollars
Make a skinny girl holla, make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me, but the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girl horny, make the fly girls corny
And only for me because I flew I-A-M holla back in the morning
Hey, now holla back if you on set
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit I don't condone it
Aw baby just hop on it


You like that
I know
Marley, what up
Hey, hey, hey


Show me what you got lil mama
Show me what you got pretty lady
Show me what you got shorty
Show me what you got baby
You rappers ain't safe
