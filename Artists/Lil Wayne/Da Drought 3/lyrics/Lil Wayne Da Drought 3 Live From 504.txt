Dro fuck with me!
Live from the 504 it's Mr. Crazy flow
Jumping like a bungee no rope
Even in the dungeon I glow
Even if ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't about money I go
Nowhere I'm nailed to the floor
Money controls where I go
It is the sail to my boat
And it's going down it's going down
Like there's a whale in the boat
See you can smell that I smoke
And yep I sip that lean
You hit me with that combination that make my eyes bleed
I'mma shark in the water yep I swim with the big
So I don't have time to deal with Willy the squid
L-lilly pad niggas l-look at the monster
Y-you don't want to crash like la la bamba
See it's me on the interey
And my new drop is very water-melon plum
Just call it fruit punch
I'm an old rapper getting new bucks
And all you new rappers your just new lunch.
Flow sick so sick need a doc, yes
A creature, monster like the Loch Ness,
I get hotter by the tock before I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock, "Gimme a sec!"
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
I'm runnin' this bitch like
Eric b enemy back
'cause everytime I hit a track I'm like an energy pack,
the instruments are crying out where the sympathy at?
If you betting money baby him will be back
Whatever legends look like, bitch I'm fin to be that,
I walked right in hip hop, like where my dinner be at?
I ate that and I was like, where my dinner be at?
I hate that women lie so I lie to them back.
Got two bitches in my pants quiet neither them that,
a lot of bitches want dick, I give a lot of them that.
Let's do a pill I can fuck you for an hour with that and to the KIDS DRUGS KILL I'm acknowledging that.
but when I'm on the drugs I don't have a problem with that.
And my niggas got guns the size of toddlers bitch and we aiming right at your fucking collar bitch.
POW
