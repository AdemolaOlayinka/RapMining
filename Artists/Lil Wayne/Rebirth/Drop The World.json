    "lyrics": "I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes\nHate in my heart, love in my mind\nI seen nights full of pain, days are the same\nYou keep the sunshine, save me the rain\nI search but never find, hurt but never cry\nI work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind\nAnd it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond\nThe top gets higher the more that I climb\nThe spot gets smaller and I get bigger\nTrying to get in where I fit in; no room for a nigga\nBut, soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker\nCause, all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker\n\nSo I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head\nBitch, I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head\nAnd I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker\nHop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker\nI'm gone\nMotherfucker, I'm gone\n\nI know what they don't wanna tell you\nJust hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof\nI walk up in the world and cut the lights off\nAnd confidence is a stain they can't wipe off\nMy word is my pride\nBut wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise\nServed to survive, murdered and bribed\nAnd when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside\n\n\nI'm gone, I'm gone\nIt hurts but I never show this pain you'll never know\nIf only you could see just how lonely and how cold\nAnd frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall\nWhen push come to shove, I just stand up and scream \"fuck em all\"\nMan, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in\nUp it's time to raise it, then\nYour days are numbered like pages in\nMy book of rhymes. Got em cooking, boy\nThis crooked mind of mines got em all shook\nAnd scared to look in my eyes\nI stole that fucking clock, I took the time\nAnd I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up\nAnd butt-fucked this game up\nBetter be careful when you bring my name up\nFuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim\nBut the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it\nBut I swear, one way or another\nI'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it\nI swear to God, won't spare the rod\nI'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod\nOr I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody\nSleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie\nPermanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye\nThis world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!\nMy head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal\nI'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball\nI could run circles around you so fast\nYour fuckin' head'll spin, dogg\nI'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'\n",
