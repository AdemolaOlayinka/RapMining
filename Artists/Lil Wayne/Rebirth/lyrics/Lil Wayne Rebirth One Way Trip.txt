Lil Wayne
Rebirth
2010)
Beat the beat up till the beat get punch drunk
Drown in my flow mutha fucka bring ya swimming trunks
Everybody say they just do it well I just don't
Times do change mutha fucka but my gun don't
Woke up this morning with my dick to the ceiling
Fell asleep with anutha chick from my building
Kick her ass out and have breakfast like a muuu fucka
I'm with anutha bitch by suppa
Yeahh, me and hate that's an odd couple
Haha, you niggas fake you wouldn't pop bubbles
You can act stupid, bitch I'm dumber
And T Barker is my mutha fuckin drumma lets go

I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm falling down a landslide
On a one way trip to you

I been doin this shit
And you know what they say about the shoe if it fit
Have a ball till I fall though,
And if I die today i bet the world end tomorrow
Haha it's fucked up how you ain't never me
And I got blind money money you will never see
And only in the mirror is where you'll find a better me
I make money and my fingers make the letter B
I'm very sick, very sicker than you
And when I play sick, I'm Jordan with tha flu
Hah then I become a mutha fucka
And my nigga Travis Barker is my drumma mutha fucka lets go

I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm falling down a landslide
On a one way trip to you

Uhh, I get better with time, and time is forever
So just sit back and watch my time get better
So check ya watch, I'm strong as scotch
Poppa was a rolling stone I was born to rock
Tell it like it is I don't know when it isn't
To be or not to be, shit I don't know my decision
I don't know I made it for this long in this condition
Cuz my flow so sick I shoulda died in the first verse
Mr. doctor Carter with my hand up a nurse skirt
Suck me like soup and Imma eat you like Surf and Turf
Haha, just let me know when you are coming
And my mutha fuckin nigga T Barker keep drummin let's go

I'm fallin down a landslide
On a one way trip to you
You want me to take you for a ride
Well let's see what you can do
And it feels like uhh uh uh uh uhhh
And I know just what to do
Because I'm falling down a landslide
On a one way trip to you
On a one way trip to youuuu
On a one way trip to youuuu
