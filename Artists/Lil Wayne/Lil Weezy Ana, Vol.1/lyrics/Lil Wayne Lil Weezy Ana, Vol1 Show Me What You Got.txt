Good mornin New York

Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, purdy lady
Dough is what I got, shawty
Dough is what I got, babay
Come on: I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid
Hey, give a women none, uh-uh
I already gave my brother some
It's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do bird
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
And the world in the barrel of the pistol turn
Boy, we get it how we live, never live and learn
Got to talk about the flow cause you is concerned
Only down South could of been in The Firm
Or, The Commission, or a Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick like Liu Kang, nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow, how you want me ma?
Nigga get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recordin
I must be LeBron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been startin
Same triangle offense
I come through the lane like a Dodge, and
Referee niggas is lame, they call chargin'
I have no brain, I'm retarded
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late September, whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I am talkin to no particular audience
But understand, I'm the guardian
And understand, there won't be no guarding him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy runnin like a faucet
She better catch like she's Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's Up!", like Martin
Hahahah, wooo, yeah, see
I know y'all talk about me
And... you don't like what you hear sometime
But um, um; since I'm so bright
I'mma put the spotlight on you, baby
Show me what you bout, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin
I know what your not, wodie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up: Now blaze, hey, blaze, hey, blaze, hey, blaze
Work it
Yeah, tell the world "Take six"
Young dictionary: Make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollars
Make a skinny girl holler
Make a fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me
Put the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny
Make the fly girls corny
And only for me
Because of who I A-M
Holla back in the mornin
Hey, now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit - I don't condone it
Aw, baby just hop on it
Hahah, yeah...
You like that
I... Know!
Marley, whattup?
Hey, hey, hey
Show me what ya got, lil mama
Show me what ya got, purdy lady
Show me what ya got, shawty
Show me what ya got, babay
