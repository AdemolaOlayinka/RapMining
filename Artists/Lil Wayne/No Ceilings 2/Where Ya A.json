    "lyrics": "No Ceilings\nHey now, you're an all-star\nBut the bitches you be with, they are sub-par\nBut the bitches you be with, they be cock-blockin'\nHope you put the kid to sleep, they be cock-blockin'\nYou could really get this meat, get this hot sausage\nAnd I'm way too rich to beef, I just buy a body\nAnd I really kick my feet up and that's not karate\nYeah I really kick my feet up, let a thot massage 'em\nWhere ya ass was at when I was with the Hot Boys?\nProlly watchin' Baller Blockin', eatin' popcorn\nWhere ya ass was at? You was in the drought, boy\nI was prolly at the fight bringin' out Floyd\nSay she love me cause I'm laid back, she outgoin'\nI possess a drank, pockets fat like Samoan\nI just told my goons I got it, I just waved 'em off\nI just told Tunechi I got it and he said, \"Of course\"\nLose my mind the only time I ever take a loss\nI work too hard for takin' off... I'm takin' off\nReally 'bout to see a billion, all in arm's reach\nSleep on a hammock in the middle of two palm trees\nMy neighbors can't sleep, all they hearin' is them cars screech\nMy bitch can't sleep, all she hearin' is them car keys\nI'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired to talk, please\nI'm just sipped out and I'm way too tired, I'm yawning\nWhere ya ass was at when I was 15 in a Porsche?\nWhere ya ass be at when we be poppin' all these corks?\nWhere ya ass be at? Know you're prolly with them dorks\nI'm prolly with some bitches that be poppin' pills and snort\nDiamonds in my mouth, no Swarovski\nI'm hittin' notes with the pistol, oh I'm off-key\nAnd the money... come at godspeed\nI'm movin' slow, Lisa Turtle, Lark Voorhies\nFrom the treasure chest, inside was a heartbeat\nAnd Katrina had us hustlin' out a RV\nWe had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey\nWe had to stash and steal, balled, Steve Harvey\nAnd we set a nigga up like eHarmony\nAnd your bitch plain, nigga, and your car cheap\nAnd we leave your brain right there on your broad's cheek\nAnd we leave some stains right there on your offspring\nAnd the purple rain right here in the soft drink\nYeah the purple rain right here in the soft drink\nAnd to fight the pain, nigga, like a horse train\nAnd we don't complain, nigga, and we don't blink\nAnd he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think\nI think you run with 12 and I think these hoes quiet link\nI be so underwhelmed cause I swear his hoe's style's weak\nI'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed\nI'm movin' slow as hell but the money comin' godspeed\nI just told a pussy nigga, \"Call your henchman, nigga\"\nI just stole on a nigga mid-sentence, nigga\nFiend searchin' in a haystack for syringes, nigga\nDopeman got 'em flippin' like some ninjas, nigga\nGot 'em tweakin', got 'em lurkin', got 'em cringin', nigga\nThat's them symptoms, nigga, I can prevent 'em, nigga\nSplit a nigga's head in two, that's split decisions, nigga\nBeen to Hell and back, came back in mint condition, nigga\nFeel like Heaven winnin' racks, return to spend a nigga\nFeel like Heaven's only lackin' your attendance, nigga\nFeel like stuntin', drop them tops but not them windows, nigga\nToss out your demo, I ain't even like your intro, nigga\nI just went Kimbo with this tempo, un momento, nigga\nYou know my M.O., nigga, spit that A.M.M.O., nigga, blat\nI ask my ceilings where ya ass was at\nTo all my Ceilings fans, I'm back, they pushed the album back\n",
