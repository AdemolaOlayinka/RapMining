Lil Wayne
No Ceilings 2
2015)
My name is
My name is
My name is
Weezy Baby
And I'm high like maintenance
I'm smokin, I'm drinkin
Leanin daily like
Hi, my name is
You know what my name is
Bitch, I'm famous
Like Tom Brady
And hi, your name is?
Not important
Who cares?
Not Weezy Baby, uh
Wake up I see bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch
Make-up on my pillows make me mad bitch
Without no make up I see that bitch as just average
Uber, Uber, Uber, Uber, Taxi!
Looking at my rollie I got boogers on my rollie
Bout to hook up with my whoadies
Got the hook up on that codeine
Got the sugar for your nose ring
Got the blooka I'm reloading
And according to my darling
This dick feels so damn rewarding
I'm reporting out of shorty
She so naughty me so horny
Kilo on me like I'm Tony
Break it down, the rice-a-roni
Take her out look like she lonely
I'm gonna candle, light the moment
I'm a fan I like the pussy
She told him my phone was roamin'
She be moaning to the morning
I be gone and I be on it
I be in it I'm like foreman on the grill
And I got doorman at the entrance
They got pistols in they trenches
They got rituals religion
And I'm like bitch you know I'm sipping till I die
My name is
Lil Wayne bitch
Weezy F Baby
Her name went
From whatever it was
To Lil Wayne bitch
Now that's crazy and I
I camed in, regain strength
Rebanged it, rotation
Her guy is nameless
He ain't shit
Always on the same shit
Poor baby
I pour up so much they call me pour baby
Kush man I need a sack like Charles Haley
Sipping to the Big Moe, I'm the bar baby
Zip got me moving slow but my thoughts racing
My long days give me short patience
My heart vacant, awards taken
What in tarnation, no information
No statements, young mula, old mula, mula all ages
Ha-Hallelujah I'm the Hollygrove 2Pac
Roc-a-fella new rock hundred K in a shoebox
AK and a new Glock, a-what-baba-lou-bop
Pray the best you got, I save you like a coupon
Hustle till my dreadlock is grey as Poupon
Everyday is my birthday I'm a new born
Stay on my toes ask a shoe horn
I ain't got no roof on
Gettin' my, No Ceilings 2 on
I'm high, I'm brainless
I'm stainless, entertainment
His lady and um
If she ain't thick, then she ain't it
I can't fuck with, a slim lady
I tried, superhead, keep complaining
Bitch ancient, bitch shady and she tired
Okay then, I'm skating
Doing tricks, call me trick swayze
Okay
In other news, in other niggas hoes
Your wife taste like honey nut cheerios
I'm in the mirror like oh baby
Who needs a miracle when I got you baby
Pimping in my last life, I'm the shit you ass wipe
Beat the pussy cat fight, my teeth look like a flashlight
Weed is like an airline cause easily I'm that high
Fist full of money mix some green in with your black eye
Greedy like a fat guy, I eat a nigga franchise
I beat him by a landslide
A leader like a rabbi
I'm leading by halftime
He's bleeding I'm a vampire
His body in the trunk with his feet all on my alpines
Read a nigga that's right, we all that and fries
Y'all gone stand-by my broads got cat eyes
Traphouse land lines, boom like land mines
All my bitches allies with Tune on their backsides
So hi, my name is
On her anus
On her cranium
Bitch craving it
And I'm fly and I'm wavy
And her name is bust-it-baby
And hi, my name is
In your mouth, it must be tasty
Gone
