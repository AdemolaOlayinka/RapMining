I Am Not A Human Being
2010)
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
They do it for the troops
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute

Yeah, uh
So sick with the flow
Yeah your cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo no T.O.
No wetting cowboys to a piston
A.I. no wallace your kids getting demolished
I’m booking on your suckers like I’m just leaving college
But smart, very smart, too smart for ya knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME nothing gets inbetween us

Tell Wayne I’m going in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game nobody could ever bury me
Thats why you see me on stage rocking with young money
I told my team I got us man it’s all on me
Like volume 2 BG I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Everytime I’m on the track it’s ransom
Can’t find us anymore it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
They do it for the troops
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
The salute
The salute

Hey I solomly swear if it ever go down
You aint never gotta call me cause I’mma be there
Lets get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shelltoes
Strapped like velcrow and this we running hell no
And truthfully, aiming for number one oh do we
You ask why I reply cause nobody remember 2 or 3
Cross YM and the hem will make a movie
We all that we can be, respect the army and salute we

Yeah, Young Money army we marching
We coming forward no warning
We got these boys running like Forest
So salute me like a general
First place never last
Always on top and I’m a cheif like a seminol
Got the game in a strangle hold no letting up
You can get the top, ya can pop like 7 Up
Knock knock let us up, young money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joystick

I’mma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camoflauge me,
Cuz Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
They do it for the troops
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
It’s young money salute
The salute
The salute

Commander in chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the World, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now thats G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10ft money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I’m in deep like wet pussy
I’m a purple heart proven war vet rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the card building
Like ain’t we God’s children
I know at all times God’s feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute or shoots, Nick
Get this salute out my face!

The 16 years veteran
I been in this motherfuckin hip-hop war
All my motherfuckin life
But I still have that

Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
They do it for the troops
It’s young money salute
