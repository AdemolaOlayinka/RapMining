    "lyrics": "Ahhhh I stank I can, I stank I can\nThe funky engine that could\nOooo oooo yosky, wosky, pisky, wisky\nAll aboard the Stankonia Express\nThe underground smell road\nEverybody's lookin' for an excuse to let loose\nWhat's your locomotive, the chatter and the choo choo\n\n\nHumble as a mumble in the jungle\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've got to re-route my dreams\n\n\n\nBack on the microphone, your number one controller\nI rock the microphone like a blizzard;\nI'm so cold I'm tryin' to hold ya\nLife is like a great big roller coaster\nEverything in life don't happen like it's suppose to\nTrials and tribulations make you stronger live longer\nYou wanna reach the nation nigga start from ya corner\nEverything in life don't always happen like you plan it\nDemand it; over stand it then you handle it\nFuck wishing you, you missing the ambition on your mission\nNow you switching why you quitting 'cause it's heated in the kitchen\nSloppy slipping in your pimping nigga\nYou either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger\nYou've got to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams\n\"No Weapon Formed Agains Prospers\" 54:17\nFrom Isaiah lay a nigga down and spray 'em\nIf the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards you've gotta play 'em\n\n\n\n\nToo Democratic, Republic fuck it\nWe chicken nugget, we dip in the sauce like mop and bucket\nBlue-collar scholars, who'll take your dollar and wipe my ass wit it\nYou living for the lotto never hit it, I met a critic\nI made her shit her draws\nShe said she tought Hip Hop was only guns and alcohol\nI said \"Oh hell naw!\" but yet it's that too\nYou can't discrimahate because you done read a book or 2\nWhat if I looked at you in a microscope saw all the dirty organisms\nLiving in your closet would I stop and would I pause it \"whoo\"\nTo put that bitch in slower motion, got the potion and the antidote\nAnd a quote for collision the decision\nIs do you want to live or wanna exist\nThe game changes everyday so obsolete is the fist and marches\nSpeeches only reaches those who already know about it\nThis is how we go about it\n\n\n\n\nI'm wild just like a rock, a stone, a tree\nAnd I'm free, just like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I flow, just like a brook, a stream, the rain\nAnd I fly, just like a bird up in the sky\nAnd I'll surely die, just like a flower plucked\nAnd dragged away and thrown away\nAnd then 1 day it turns to clay\nIt blows away, it finds a ray, it finds its way\nAnd there it lays until the rain and sun\nThen I breathe, just like the wind the breeze that blows\nAnd I grow, just like a baby breastfeeding\nAnd it's beautiful, that's life and that's life\nAnd that's life and that's life\n\n\n\n\nHumble as a mumble in the jungle\nOf shouts and screams\nThat's the way the cracker crumbles\nSo I guess I've gotta re-route my dreams\nY'all can't harm me, it's over\n",
