We luv deez hoez\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nDon't lie you love them, if you don't you like them hoez a whole lot\nJust like your mama Sunday cookin' turkey necks in the pot\nYou ready to drop your load like prop planes be droppin' that cocaine\nYou ready to turn your fro, from natural straight to a cold wave\nDat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels\nPopped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat\nI made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie\nInjection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty\nSo Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth\nYou suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy\nFrom a Figueroa to a herringbone\nFrom droppin' her off to takin' her home\nShe tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong\nThe bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues\nYou fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one\nNigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash\nAnd let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!\nYeah, I told y'all niggas\nAbout god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory\nLettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps\nThey ain't goin' do nuthin'\nBut try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\n\nAy, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente\nShe walk wit a fly Sashay\nLook here say, I'm just a Fat Face I come through swervin' (ay, ay)\nYou love the way the leather grippin' your butt\nConversation kill 'em, drippin' em up\nRelax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts\nWhippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax\nI stay G sharp as a note of music\nCall me fresh baked bread, make a broad lose it\nI'm just sayin' they just can't stand to see me execute game plan\nI slow it down, she like it - speed it up\nShe poked it out, I beat it up like that\nHit 'em from the back, had to increase that ho vocabulary\n\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\n\nYeah, yeah, Gipp keep it double loco\nMet up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry\nConversation hasty cause I was ready to dip\nSweatsuit velour so I ordered Kahlua\nFell in, hit her with the garden hose\nLeft her with the pokahose, got up and didn't say goodbye\nHer face wrinkle up and froze\nWhy you leavin' so soon, supposed to\nAnd ain't no question about that\nThey call me Big Gipp on the southside\nMr. Get Down in the veins so what's the word\nDon't fall in love with good pussy off the top\nBetter leave for two months come back and pop, \"study the shit\"\n\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nFrom the weave to the fake eyes\nTo the fake nails, down to the toes\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\nHa ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez\n",
