    "lyrics": "Starts off like a small town marriage\nLovely wife and life, baby carriage\nNow all the stars have cars, success of course\nBut it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce\n\n\nAnd I'm a start\nYea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood\n'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on\nI really think they're stealin from us like a sample song\nI really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home\nThe hurricane come and took my Louisiana home\nAnd all I got in return was a darn country song\nThis whole country wrong\nWhat would you write if you just put a little ice on\nAnd cut your mic on\nBut you don't even write songs\nBut Hollywood make you spit like a python\nI meant Cobra, I'm so not sober\nI'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda\nYou can call me a roller\nYour grill's glistenin'\nSpent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different\nWhat's the real sense of it?\nBling bling, I know\nAnd did you know I'm the creator of the term\nI just straightened the perm\nAint let it sit too long, they just makin it burn\nAnd make a movie of our lifestyle\nBut they earn like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece\nThat's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease\nAnd I be's the little nigga\nCooler than anti-freeze defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne\nBut in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne\nDon't make me nut\nSo that's why I got a pre-nup\nI do\n\n\n\n\nYeah, Yeah\nA is for Adamsville\nB is Bowen Homes\nSee if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't\nIf she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone\nIf she do got some good head on her let her sing a song\nD is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb\nShe ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer\nBut she keep comin back three stacks must be some crack\nPut that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act\nNow that I've got your undivided attention I'm\nGonna say this and run under condition one\nPromise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball\nPromise me you'll invest three fourths of it all\nFor what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese\nCan't get with it? Get get get get get on your knees\nCause wealth is the word\nRich is round the corner from the curb\nDon't like what I write? Shoot me a bird\n\n\n(Starts off)\nTenth grade, the way was pave for me and Dre. to create\nLike Dr. Frankenstein the arts and crafts\nNow could we make a difference\nAntoine Patton and Andre Benjamin\nBeen jammin for you crabbing rap niggaz and journalists\nThat's quick to misprint public and private business\nThen retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed\nPart two the sequel all new 'Kast\nJust ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet\nSlanndering your name behind that screen name\nThey're lame and their life is pretty plain\nM&M's with no nuts\nWon't show up face-to-face straight bitch made\nLike puppies on the nipples of a mutt\nAddress it on a case-by-case basis like the judge\nWhat about these lyin' ass hoes tryin to plot\nOr these niggaz on the block who want the queen (Nigga please)\nBut even she can walk we'll miss her we ain't gon' fake it\nBut God don't make mistakes must be something bigger waiting\n\n\n\n\nI do, love you but you hate me at the same time\nLights, camera, action, it's game time\nDo you take this here as your lovely wife?\nTo love her and cherish her for all your life?\nI solemnly swear to dare share take you there\nAnd me and you together baby we a lucky pair\nIt's been a long time, we walked a thin line\nOthers say they got you but you been mine\nAs I sit back and watch all them cat fights\nDomestic violence - is that right?\nBut you love the dogg, gave me the spotlight\nAnd now I'm growin up, showin up, blowin up\nI never ever thought that we would separate at all\nBut you played me like a game of football\nUsed to feed me, need me, dress me\nNow it's so messy straight cut out and left me\n\n\nHollywood divorce\nAll the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing\nLook at blues, rock, jazz, rap\nNot even talkin about music\nEverything else too\nBy the time it reach Hollywood it's over\nBut it's cool\nWe just keep it goin and make new shit\n\n\nTake our game, take our name\nGive us a little fame\nAnd then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang\n",
