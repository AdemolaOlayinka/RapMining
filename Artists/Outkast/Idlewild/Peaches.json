And everytime you see the family they look happy\nGot her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog\nBut daddy had her cat on the side\nHe would hide her from his ride decide not to divide\nKept the yam in the (hide) the spouse in the house\nBoy its cheaper to keep her you fuck around and take a loss\nCome up short like Short Dog cuss words flow like\n( Motherfuckaer shit gotdamn asshole)\nTook my shit ( Beeitch!) FUCK!\n\n\nStages in life no one said that it was right\nBut I've got to hustle for the kids\nGod only knows what I've gone and been\nTil we reach the end\nJust stay strong and be a friend\n\n\nIt was the night that they done dipped and all throughout the palace\nThat didn't do his part heartbroke or no more marriage\nWhen it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin\nYou coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend\nNow you sittin in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant\nPleadin to the judge you was in it to win it\nIn the beginnin was splendid see she was grinnin and spendin\nAll of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook\nShe was fierce on the stove it was always great\nCovered plates in the microwave when I came home late\nBut now we just debate like some candidates damn I hate\nFriction wishin I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't\nDamn... fuckin around\n\n\nStages in life no one said that it was right\nBut I've got to hustle for the kids\nGod only knows what I've gone and been\nTil we reach the end\nJust stay strong and be a friend\n\n\nGirl you have to remember\nI gotta provide for the family and future\nSo please stay down and please stay around cause you know\nThat I'm tryna change but its hard cause I've been this way\n( Man you already knew that shit)\n\n\nStages in life no one said that it was right\nBut I've got to hustle for the kids\nGod only knows what I've gone and been\nTil we reach the end\nJust stay strong and be a friend\n",
