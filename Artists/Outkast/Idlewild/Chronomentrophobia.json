The fear of time\n\n\nHigh as the cost of living\nI take what I've been given\nPastor say \"be strong\"\nOoh hey hey\nI ain't got time leave me alone\n\nI ain't got much time left\nI've got to funk you now\n\n\nChronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia\nChronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia\nChronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia\nChronomentrophobia chronomentrophobia\n\n\nLord be havin mercy on my soul\nI'm havin the impression that my life gon be a bowl\nOf cherries but its very hard for me to cope\nGot tired of bein broke\nThis ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope\nMade up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds\nOn a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head\nBorn in 1975 never thought I'd make it this far\nStill battlin in this racial war\nTryin to find solutions to the situation I'm facin\nOnly thing thats free is my flow that y'all be chasin\nLettin my niggaz know before I go I drop that knowledge\nLike droppin books lets stop the crooks\nFrom robbin you of your brains and such usin welfare as a crutch\nI'm in it for good you into my hood you won't be findin much\nHope that when I'm gone y'all remember this\nWhat we stood for \"fuck that fame and that glitz\"\nIt's beginnin to look a lot like the endin\nAnd got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin\nRevelations gettin impatient and now I'm dead\nRemember what I said I'm gone bow ya heads\n",
