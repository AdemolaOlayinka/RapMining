Not me\n\n\n\n\nUh, well you know we gettin blizzard cuz we got that chicken gizzard\nIn the dungeon and scope but some of you niggaz can't cope with it\nSo, Opie, hip hop, to the front, to the back and it don't stop\nFrom the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park\nSo got on Martino, it's Outkast for the 94 era\nYou heard the player's call, we takin it to another level\nSo 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martel\nAnd you may go to hell\n\n\nSet sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is\nIt's that Southern ses in your chest that is\nOne mo' gen for my friend who don't take\nNo bullshit from no bitch who is stank\nI ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will make you\nSilly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you\nDown like some bo-los, you can throw those\nHead, til I'm dead, yes, it's now your broke hoes\nDon't get me wrong to disrespect is not my shit\nBut if you fall in this category, then youse a bitch\n",
