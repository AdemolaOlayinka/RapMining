Take me to your leader (Ooh Shit!)\n\n\nD.E.E.P. you want to go D.E.E.P., I'll take ya D.E.E.P.\nYou know you fucked up when you let my mind creep\nDeeper than the page of a book let me look\nYou let me hit the stage, that's when I got my folks hooked like...\n\n\nDeeper than deep dish, hammers and vogues\nDeeper fish in the O (cean)\nI got my gun, I'll stamp out like Coast Guards\nYou boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like erb, word (hey man)\nYou heard it here first with your master plan in reverse\nI ain't the one with the curse, so disperse, yes, catchin blades\nNiggaz catchin AIDS, niggaz gettin sprayed, niggaz on they way\nTo a dead end, you won't catch me spreadin no white thighs\nI only see afro bitches up in my eyes\nI don't eat no beef and surely not no pork\nI used to drink that 8, but now I shove it down your throat\nQuote, 'If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?'\nI'm Outkasted and claimin true\nAimin two at your muthafuckin spine\nNo, I make that three cuz I don't wanna hear you whine\nSwine, got my folks blind, like Stevie\nMe be, wonderin when I'm gonna see the end\nAndre 'gain slammin backs like King acts\nOver Organized tracks full of facts\nSo you know that it's D.E.E.P.\n\n\n\n\nWell, you want me to get D.E.E.P., well then, I will\nWhat? What will happen if you shoot that nigga and don't kill\nHe will come back and return like Lalah Hathaway\nAimin for your skull, yeah I'm flexin on you that a way\nSo if you pullin a tool, nigga you better use it\nCuz if you're threatenin my life, better believe I'll be a fool with it\nI don't take no shit from nobody, I gots the Goodie Mo crew right beside of me\nDamn, no pain, no gain, some I'mma hurt you\nBreakin knees and elbows like I used to break my curfew\nMy mama used to tell me if a nigga ever hit me\nJust to pick up the closest thing and knock the living shit out of he\nSo if you run up, you get done up, I'mma end it\nThrow the gun up out the window, see the corner that I bent it\nIt's just so simple when we get so D.E.E.P.\nLearn a lesson, pick up the album when it hits the streets like...\n\n\n\n\nNo, I ain't never been pimped by the system\nThat's because I ain't no slave\nDon't be tryin to sunbathe, never lived off in no cave\nBloody old chap and in this head of mine is full of naps\nAnd the only thing I know is how to fuck and how to rap\nY'all think I'm stupid cuz I shoots 'em up like cupid\nAnd if you gave me a basketball, I'll show you how to shoot it\nMy head's polluted cuz I'm truly bobbin to the bottom\nIf a pair of Jordan's came out, y'all figure that I got 'em\nBut no I don't because I don't be havin fun\nThe gold that I am wearin is really made out of bronze\nIt weighs a ton and makin my neck turn green\nAnd I got a criminal record that will never come clean\nOh, and it seems that I make babies like a rabbit\nAnd then never taking care of them has just become a habit\nI grab my tablet and get busy with the pen\nY'all could not be just like me if y'all was my twin\nSo you get mad and try to make me inferior\nYou pissin me off, I'm in that ass like interior\nOh, step in my Cadillac, let's ride through the hood\nEh, why don't you roll that window down so you can see it real good\nAnd take a look at all the pimps and all the pushers and the players\nThat's livin on a whim, thin ice and a prayer\nOh and mayor, can I get a little backup\nPlease don't let them pussy muthafuckas put that flag up\nBut let me shut up cuz they say we need dough\nWhenever the fuck out record comes out in 1994\nYeah, yes sir, it's like that\nGonna take y'all deep, so go back\n\n\n\n\nI'm gettin D.E.E.P. like a prostitute's vagina\nAnd pimpin way mo' hoes than there's peoples out in China\nI roll that black Lac with the crust velvet interior\nNiggaz try to bite their shit, but their shit is inferior\nWe rollin thick like the Pillsbury Doughboy\nAnd I don't give a damn, muthafucka cuz you know why\nThe Caucus Mountains and the mutant gene\nYou try to wipe a nigga like me slam up off the scene\nYou hear me bastard, work a little bit faster\nBecause of the shit that I done been through, I shall never call you master\nYou D-E-V-I-L, the cave is where you dwell\nSo stay up out the rain, it's beginning to smell like dog, yeah\nI wonder how you would react if you was in my shoes\nYou'd probably shit your tightest draws cuz I got a solid fuse\nSo what do you really wanna do when I get militant\nThought I was a pimp, flip the script if you can' get with this\nThey call me Big Boi, I be cappin with a big gun\nRun up on it if you want it, then you bite the big one, yeah\nUh huh, can you deal with it, D-E-V-I-L\n",
