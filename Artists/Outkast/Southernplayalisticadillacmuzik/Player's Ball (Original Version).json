Peace\n\nIt's beginnin to look a lot like what?\nFollow my every step take notes\nOn how i creep I's bout ta go in deep\nThis is the way i creep my season\nHere's my ghetto rep i kept to say\nThe least no no it can't cease so i\nBegin to piece my two and two together\nGots no snowy weather have to\nFind something to do better bet!\nI said subtract so shut up that\nNonsense about some solid nine i got say\nCrock if it ain't real it\nAin't right i'm like no matter what the season\nForever chill with spin i get my fin i chill with less\nAnd got my reasons so tell me what did you expect?\nYou thought i'd break my neck to help y'all deck the halls oh\nNow i got nuther means of celebratin i'm gettin biz to that ho-jo i\nGots the hoochie waitin i made it through\nTo another year cain't ask fo nothing much mo it's Outkast\nFor the boots i thought you knew so now you know\nLet's go\n\nAll the players came from far and wide\nWearing afros and braids in every gangstar ride\nNow i'm here to tell yah there's a better day\nWhen the player ball is happenin on christmas day\n\nHallelujah hallelujah yah know i do some things more different than i\nUsed ta coz i'm a player doing what the players do the package store is\nClosed okay my deck is woofin this is rediculus i'm gettin serious i'm\nGettin curious coz the house is smelling sick of chitlins all this\nVicious i make no wishes coz the modern folk is in the back gettin tipsy\nOff the nog-en and i's in a hellova contact smoke they havin a smoke out\nIn my back seat they passing herb reminding verses coz it's in the air i\nHit the parks hit the cuts i'm makin switches clicking the switches side\nTa side lookin for hoe snitches i'm wide open on the\nFreeway my pager broke my vibe coz a junkie is a junkie three sixty\nFive it's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me\nGrab my pistol and my ounce see what they junkies got to give me coz\nIt's like that, yeah\nForever pimpin, never slipin, that's how it is {check it!}\n\nAin't no chimminies in the ghetto so i won't be hangin my socks on no\nTip how far does it tick fix me a drink i got the remedy so bring in\nThat ham {not!} don't need no ham {hocks!} don't play me like i'm smokin\nRocks i got the money we gots the freaks in the dungeon just to let you\nKnow coz in ninety three that's how we comin so hoe hoe hoes check my\nKing ass fro the gin and juice gots me tipsy so on\nIt goes hit me ten and i'll serve you then now we in the corner in my\nCadillac my heart does not go pitty pat for no rat i'm leaning back my\nElbows out the windows cold rhyming indo fills my body where's the party\nWe rode deep we dip to underground see's a lot of hoes around i split my\nGame while waiting count down a five fo a three two here comes the one a\nDo yah have me copy folks spark another one\nHere's a little something for all the players out there hustling, gettin\nDown for theirs, from east point, college park, decatur, devrai, you\nKnow world wide, down for theirs\n",
