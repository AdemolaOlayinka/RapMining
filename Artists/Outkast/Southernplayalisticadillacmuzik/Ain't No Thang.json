Can yo punk ass come out to play?\nStay in your little hole, then coward duck your head\nYou don't know who you be fuckin with youse better off...dead\nIs what I say, best run the other way\nIn case of physical breakdown...y'all can break now\nMy kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp\nMake yourself exempt\nPussy footin around don't be gettin y'all nowhere but stuck\nNowhere to duck, pull his file, niggaz die\nBy gettin blasted, how drastic\nThey got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do\nI got the nerve to serve you up just like a raider do, but naw (naw, naw)\nI take that back, that's my problem\nTurnin and walkin away, this ain't gon work when they be robbin\nAs long as Big Boi's still livin, never standin by my lonesome\nStep up nigga, if you want some\n\n\nAin't no thang but a chicken wang\nWe havin a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane\nIt's just a pimps (players), Mack daddies (East Point)\nIt's all about that ses in yo chest (It's the joint)\n\n\nWell nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits\nIt's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits\nI'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause, it's the\nOriginal ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch\nI used to sell dope, but in 1994\nI'm makin Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik\nBut see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscin\nAbout the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens\nShe had me makin better grades to make a better life\nBut I never had no love or respect, cuz we gon be alright\nI ran the streets and broke my curfew cuz I gave a shit\nI carried guns and butcher knives cuz I was steadily in the mix, yeah\nIt was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now\nI'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now\nI call the wild because it's time to take the streets\nSo if you ain't got the burner, bring your big enough nuts (retreat)\nI'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal\nJust an international playa, comin through your stereo\n\n\n\n\n3-5-7 to your fo'head, there'll be mo' dead\nCuz I'mma po' kid\nSo Lord forgive me, I got to keep my milly right here near me\nWhen I be doin fine until these niggaz want to clear me off my street\nBut in my hood hood, they hollerin ghetto\nDon't have no neighbors that hit the pipe but never let go\nBut I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you\nAin't shit that we can do but rest in peace, pour a brew\nOn the concrete, remember when we ran deep\nRemember at the party when we served them niggaz dandy\nThey know not to test us, test me, do me, try me\nTrippin with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me\nOne is in mid-air and one is the chamber\nY'all ask me what the fuck I'm doin, I'm releasin anger\nQuick to dodge danger, I'm takin it one day\nAt a time, I got the fattest dimes around my way\nYou can sway with Andre, I'll take her to the ho-jo, bitch\nJust let you know, yeah\n\n\n\n\nIt's on my friend, on the road again, I'm travelin\nNo more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac\nI got that nigga Dre, he ridin shotgun\nAnd got my pump under my seat, in case these yougstas wanna have some fun\nI'd do it if I have to, bustin caps with this a heat and load it clip up\nAfter clip\nAnd after again, if I feel it\nThe glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters\nSee I be bustin caps like my amp be bustin speakers\nSo how do you figure that Big Boi beats ghetto blastin\nYou 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster\n1-2-3, you need to think about the future\nBefore I shoot your ass and dilute your gut with lead\nFrom my hollow clips, I'll send you to an early grave\nYou fuckin slave, you better try another way\nTo take me out, is truly something difficult\nDon't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke\nI'm out of bullets lettin loose my last clip\nI'mma kick you in your ass and your nigga gettin pistol whipped\nYou know that's how I do, you know that's how I do\n\n\n\nYeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the muthafuckin...\nOrganized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggaz\nAround the East Point way\nCollege Park is really on the map\nWe comin around Atlanta and the niggaz are really strapped\nWith the muthafuckin guns and the muthafuckin glocks\nSteady is the gas nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop\n",
