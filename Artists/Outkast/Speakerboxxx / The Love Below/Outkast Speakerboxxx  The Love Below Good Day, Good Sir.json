How so?\n\n\nOpen your eyes\nSpectacular's right in front of you\n\n\nWhatever you say... your spectacular\n\n\nNo I'm fantastically well\n\n\nCome on man make up your mind\nA minute ago you said you were fine\n\n\nNo I said I'm close to spectacular\nBut I'm meeting fine in a minute\n\n\nClose to spectacular?\nYou said you were fantastically well\n\n\nExaxtly\n\n\nExactly?? Which one are you?\nClose to spectacular or Fantastically well?\n\n\nI am certainly and without a doubt\nFantastically well and was close to Spectacular but I must say good sir\nYou just pissed spectacular off\nAnd don't even mention exactly...\nBut here comes fine right now\n\n\nOh lord, she is fine\n\nGentlemen\n\nBehold\n\nA lady\n",
