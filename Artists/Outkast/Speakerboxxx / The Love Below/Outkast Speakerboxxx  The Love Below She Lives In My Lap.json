What are you afraid of?\nThe Love Below\n\n\nShe stays alone, never sheds a single tear\nShe stays in the coolest moods, clearly woman of the year\nShe and all her girlfriends, they go out dressed to win\nShe comes back to the cooler side of town\nbut she lives in my lap\n\n\nShe lives in my lap\nForever my fiance\nShe lives in my lap\nDon't leave, don't stay\nShe lives in my lap\nI'll get the courage one day\n\n\nMake me want you, make me miss you\nmake me wonder where you are, then forget you\nGirl remind me, just who we are\nWe're oh so close, but yet so far\n\n\nBaby why are you acting like this?\nI don't care about any of them...\nI care about you!\nBaby I Love you!\n\nYou've got me open wide (I love you)\nJust Come inside (baby)\nIt's yours (it's yours)\nI'm yours (i'm yours)\nFor sure (for sure)\nPlay baby play...\n",
