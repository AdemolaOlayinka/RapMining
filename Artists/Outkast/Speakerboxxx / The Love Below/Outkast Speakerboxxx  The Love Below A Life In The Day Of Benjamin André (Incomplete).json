    "lyrics": "I met you in a club in Atlanta Georgia\nSaid me and my homeboy were coming out with an album\nYou looked at me like \"yeah, nigga, right\"\nBut you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum\nPowder, how's about them oranges?\nMoved away from home to school with big plans\nBy day, studied the history of music\nBy night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance\nTo get your pants was a Mission Impossible\nWe were both the same age, but I\nSuppose wasn't on the same page, but in\nThe same book of life, so I'd paged you when\nI felt you that were getting off of work\nOr either when you're on your way to school\nWe started hanging like Ernie and Bert\nAnd in my idle head I'm thinking: \"cool\"\nJust when I think I'm going down your shirt\nYou're hiking up your skirt now\nThe events that followed had me volley if your hometown would be\nHeaven or hell\nThe angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best\nTherefore hard to tell\nYou'd dropped me off by the dungeon\nNever came in, but I knew that you were wondering\nNow are these niggas in this house up to something\nSelling crack sack by sacks so they could function?\nWell, yes and no\nYes we were selling it\nBut no it wasn't blow\nCook it in the basement then move it at a show\nThen grab the microphone and everybody yelled \"ho!\"\nMeanwhile the video starts playing\nBET college radio and a van\nPacked full of niggas with a blunt in their hand\nAnd one in their ear\nYou know what I'm saying\nBut, I kept your number in my old phone\nGot a new chip flip with the roam roam\nSo it took me a minute to retrieve 7 digits\nBut I promised I would call you when I got home\nBut, when I got home I never did\nBy the time I did, heard that you had a kid\nBy some nigga in Decatur\nWho replied see you later when he got the good news, that's life shit\nNow, I'm 19 with a Cadillac\nMy nigga had a Lex with the gold pack\nGot a plaque but I'm living with my pop pop\nSo I got Glock and a low jack\nYou kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw\nAnd never said much cause half of what he saw\nWas so far from that place you wanna be\nThat words only fucked it up more follow me\nAre you starting to gather what I'm getting at?\nNow if I'm losing you tell me then I'll double back\nBut keep in mind, at the time \"keep it real\" was the phrase\nSilly once said now, but those were the days\nWhen Spring Break, and Daytona, and Freakniks\nMade you want to drop out of college and never go back\nMove to the south, but that ain't a Kodak\nMoment, on went myself and Big Boi\nWell you knew him as Twan\nThat's right, you were around before this shit begun\nWhen Twan had a daughter and\nSort of was made to mature before the first tour\nWe hit the road like jack\nLaughed and cried and drived it back with some Yak\nGirls used to say, y'all talk funny, y'all from the islands?\nAnd I'd laugh and they'd just keep smiling\nNo, I'm from Atlanta baby\nHe from Savannah, maybe\nWe should hook up and get tore up and then lay down, hey we\nGot to go because the bus is pulling out in 30 minutes\nShe's playing tennis disturbing the tenants\n15-love fit like glove\nDescription is like 15 doves\nIn a Jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost\nMaking one woozy in the head and comatose, agree?\nEnough about me, how's about you?\nHow's the lil' kid?\nShe was about 2 the last time we spoke\nI hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink\nCause I'd start the 2nd album off on another note\nNow, that note threw some niggas in the hood off\nBut see I'd balled out, and before I fall out\nI'd Slow my Lac down to a nice speed\nThe brain is that fried egg I might need\nNew direction was apparent\nI was a child looking at the floor staring\nSo changing my style was like release for the primitive beast\nYes I was on the rise, yeast was the street\nTo make bread - never primary concern\nJust to hop on these beats and wait my turn\nI'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas, and macaroni niggas, imposters\nSo on a trip to New York on some beeswax\nI get invited to a club where emcees at\nAnd on stage is a singer with some thing on her head\nSimilar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with\nWhich I was rocking at the time\nWhen I was going through them phases trying to find\nAnything that seemed real in the world\nStill searching, but I started liking this girl\nNow you know her as Erykah \"On and On\" Badu\nCall Tyrone on the phone why you\nDo that girl like that boy you ought to be ashamed\nThe song wasn't about me and that ain't my name\nWe're young, in love, in short we had fun\nNo regrets no abortion, had a son\nBy the name of \"7\" and he's 5\nBy the time I do this mix, he'll probably be 6\nYou do the arithmetic\nWe do the language arts\nY'all stand against the wall blindfolded, we throw the darts\nTo poke you in the heart\nAnd take you from the start\nTo when luxury transportation meant a Marta card\nOr either when your girlfriend that went to Mays\nMomma or her daddy let her borrow the Benz because she's smart\nOr maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor\nAnd he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard\nYou fix it up, you trick it out, you give it rims, you give it bump\nYou give it all your time because that's all you can think about\nAnd that's as far as I got\nAnd that's as far as I got, and where I wanted to go\nKnowing the whole time that's all you could think about\nEven though if you cut it off and start that bitch up\nYou need a jump like you'll need and you'll want to grow\nAnd you change all the time so that Rabbit that you thought about\nThat whole summer, the next summer you didn't want that Rabbit no more\nYou wanted something bigger and better\nSo the summer past and now the Rabbit's old?\nRight...right, so now you want a Cadillac...\n",
