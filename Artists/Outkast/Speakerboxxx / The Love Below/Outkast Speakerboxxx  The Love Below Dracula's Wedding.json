Dracula's wedding\n\n\nI've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you\nSee my heartbeat is a slow one, but I'm terrified of you\nI've been around for ages, but I'm terrified of you\nPut my fang across the stage, but I'm terrified of you.\n\n\nYou know I'm terrifed of you\nHere she comes\n\n\nGive me the chance to dance romance\nDon't run, I'm not the sun\nSo much at stake... oh!\nBad choice of words\nBut I'm not the gun with silver bullets\nAnd I can count, 1, 2, 3, plus I make great peanut butter\nAnd jelly sandwiches... Van Helsing\n\nFor richer or poorer, through sickness and in health\nTil death do us part\nTil death do us part\nYou only live once\nWell, not in our case\nbecause we live forever.\n",
