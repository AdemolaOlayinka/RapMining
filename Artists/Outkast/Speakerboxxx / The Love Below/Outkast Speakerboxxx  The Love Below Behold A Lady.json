(Hoooooooo!)\nYou're the anchor that holds me down\nWhen my ship is sinking\nYou won't let me drown and I'm grateful\n(Awwaww Awwawwawwawwawwwwawww!)\n\n\n\n\nYo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play\nYou'll always be this lovely\n'Cause they raised you that way\nHallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!\nThank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!\nThank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!\nYou're not extra, extra. you're so plain Jane\nThe yin to my yang, darlin'\nYou've got that thang and you know it\nBut yet you don't and that's what's so cool\nYou don't say too much, but when you do it's profound\nIn the street you hold your head high\nAt home you get low down for me\n(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah!)\nHooo! You're the anchor that holds me down\nWhen my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown (Aaaaaaahh!)\n(Ad libs)\nSad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums\nTo see what a lady looks like\nSo if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight\nIf you spot one, good sir, treat her right\nThis is Benjamin Andre signing off\nThanks a million\nGood luck and goodnight\n",
