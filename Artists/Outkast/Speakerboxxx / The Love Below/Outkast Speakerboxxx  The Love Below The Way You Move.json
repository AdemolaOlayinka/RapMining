Oooh baby!\nIf I could I would, just be with yoooou baaaaby\nOoooooh Cause you like me and excite me and you know you got me baby!\nOooooo!\n\nI like the waaay you move (I like the way you move)\nI like the waaay you move (Ooo you so sexy baaby!) (Whoo-o-o!)\nI love the waaay you move\nI love the way, I love the way (Whoo-o-o!)\n\nI love the waaay you move (I love the way you move)\nI love the waaay you move (Ooo you so sexy baaby!) (Whoo-o-o)\nI love the waaay you move\nI love the way, I love the way.\n\nI like the waaay you move\nI like the waaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)\nI love the waaay you move\nI love the way, I love the way.\n\nI love the waaay you move\nI love the waaay you move (Whoo-o-o!)\nI love the waaay you move\nI love the way, I love the way\n",
