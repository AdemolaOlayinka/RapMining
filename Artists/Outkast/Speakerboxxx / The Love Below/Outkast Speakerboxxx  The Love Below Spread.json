I can't read minds, but I can read yours\nI think she says that she wants to pour your..\nyour... yourself all over me\nWhat you think? I could be wrong, but peoples don't lie\nAnd if they do, bu God, they must fry! (fry?!)\nYou know, like electric chair\nThe way you stare (yeah I'm there)\nYou committed a crime and I'm the victim\n\n\nI've got an eye out for she who cries out passionately\nWe'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally\nI'm too young to be settling down\nquick to change my mind tomorrow\nSo now can I borrow your timid torso\nMore so than your soul, honest me gotta be how I roll\nFuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom\nYou're the prism, Shirley Chislom\nWas the first, let's rehearse making a baby\nPut in your order, I want a baby daughter\nDance on the tip of my tongue\nShake the clouds 'til there's no more wetness in them\nTell your homegirls that you will send them\nA postcard from 3000... HARD!\n\n\nDon't want to make you feel strange, but\nDon't let these words be in vain, so\nSpread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\nNature knows that I want you, but\nNot unless you want me too, so\nSpread, spread for me\n(I can't, I can't wait to get you home)\n",
