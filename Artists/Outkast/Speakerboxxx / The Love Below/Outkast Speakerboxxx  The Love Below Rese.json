You was alive\nDate of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide\nFrom T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children\nThe morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existance\nWe livin, breathin, soon we'll be teethin\nOur granny got a gold and now we want one for that reason\nAn adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages\nBut parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages\nCell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit\nIncarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit\nLittle Ricky's home, he gotta serve probation for six months\nBut Uncle Donnel and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint\nReset\n\n\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\n\n\nGood does not come without pain\nMeaning, before it gets better, it's goin get worse\nLike my homies on the sick side still dyin over turf\nThat don't belong ot urse\nI mean us, left in the dust\nTry to catch up with massah\nI used to wanna wrap my hands around the esophagus of them crackers\nBut Ephesians 6:12 said it wasn't flesh and blood that we wrestle against\nPrincipalities, powers of this world\nRulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness\nIn high places, so throw that whole armor of righteousness\nI spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba\nI got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover\nAnd brothers that wax fat an dforget all about the struggle\nYeah, come on, come on\nGuess what, guess what\nTime to reset this thang\n\n\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\n\n\nListen to me\nI awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright\nThis day will be done right\nThere is a war, just waiting on the other side of the door\nBut I'll be bringing God to the gunfight\nCan't live forever, so have some fun, right\nLife's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right\nYou can handle if tomorrow never comes, right\nYou'll get used to singin if only for one night\nBut I intend to raise two daughters and a son right\nAnd I couldn't have wrote this if I was hopeless\nAnd see I focus to provoke this\nSo open wide for my opinionated opus\nStop playin Go Fish, but not below this\nBefore I go, I thought that you all should know this\nRecognize and realize before any regretting\nBefore you relapse, perhaps you'll consider resetting\nHmm?\n\n\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\nGood doesn't come without pain\nStart over again\nEverything happens for a reason\n",
