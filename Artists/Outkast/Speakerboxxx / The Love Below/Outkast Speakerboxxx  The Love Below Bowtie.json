Yeah!!\n\n\nNasty Noompsy Knightingale\nFresh in that tuxedo\nCumberbun with no suspenders\nMy torpedo, you libido\nNeed to chat (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)\nI'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze or release the keys\nTo the shackles on her wrist, she can tackle some of this\nSmack on smack on some of this dick tracy\nArrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker\nYou took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor\nOff that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream\nShe's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things\nWhatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze!)\nIn the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene where i's...\n\n\n\n\nOh, lord! How can it be so hard??\nTo put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard\nBut I got to start by complimenting you on your physique\nYou unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak\nSpoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that\nBut it takes years of perserverance and experience to get that cat!\nSo why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that\nOn your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!\nAs we strut skip the line through the glass window glance\nWe look fine, right on time\nAs we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play\n\n\nEverybody's watching `cause them furs just hit the door\nWhile the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor\nTo the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need\nThrow your hands up if you feel me!! Throw your hands up if you feel me!!\n`Cause we well designed like the finest wine\nFeel good to be fly, so don't you ask me why\nI got the ladies in line, because they can't deny\nSo raise your hands to the sky `cause we super fly\n",
