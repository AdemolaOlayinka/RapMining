Col' people, who could boost my locomotive\nBut enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed ta\nI use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I\ncompose won't y'all get sick of that, cause I know I do when I hear those\nFlows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop\nBut to each his own, my speech is gon', keep that shit up outta my zone\nLong as you happy then I'm happy\nEven if you just hate my fuckin guts go 'head and dap me\nCause I'm gon' dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo' ass later\nCause we might need you in this war I'm wailin on you traitors\nLike that...\n",
