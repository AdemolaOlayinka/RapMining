    "lyrics": "Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold\nVisualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense\nthat we get em confused\nThe resident evil specialize in misconstruing\nWe wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doing?\nFoolin ourself, clowning ourself, playing ourself\nBy not being ourself\nWe can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat\nNimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get our meat\nWhile we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season\nlook at the picture that's painted\nTainted as the mind who's blinded to the point\nwhere Sodomites get all the rights\nWe fall for fights with fisticuffs\nGet pissed enough to miss the bus\nIt disgusts me to see my folks run up on\nI say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations\nAnd recognize this mind on the reality of horror\nknown as mankind\nJesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen\nA righteous number of righteous men\nEven Judas the Betrayer came true in the end\nThe Devil say the end is the beginning\nThey teach that we were the product of incest\nInvest no level of self into their system of Paganomics\nStand with us and don't look back upon it\nJust face this mindstate\nOtherwise Babylon...\n\n(My memories of yesterday...)\n\n\"Ninety-six gonna be that year...\"\n\n\n\nI bet you never heard of a player with no game\nTold the truth to get what I want but shot it with no shame\nTake this music dead serious while others entertain\nI see they making they paper so I guess I can't complain... or can I?\nI feel they disrespecting the whole thang\nThem hooks like selling dope to black folks\nAnd I choke when the food they serve ain't tasting right\nMy stomach can't digest it even when I bless it\nI'm confessing one mo' lesson from the South we in the house tonight\nNow hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose\nWe rolls through Headland and Delowe\nwhere me and my niggas surpassed the flow\nAnd got down for ours like hind catchers\nMy mind catches flashbacks to the black past\nwhile my close niggas laugh at\nThe Southern slang, figure ways and mojo chicken wangs\nI grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang\nSo go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen\nStarted by Afrikan Bambaata, so you and your potnah\nGather your thoughts\n\n\n\n(Something's gotta change\nSounds of laughter and happiness turns my teardrops to rain\nBeen bearing this burden for too many of my days\nlooks like breezes of autumn done finally move my way\nLike memories of yesterday...)\n\n\n\nUhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi\nIt's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy\nI'm thinkin of checking my traps and bustin my raps and throwing them craps\nSeven-eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas, they're watching yo' back\nFor the robbin crew, thinkin they robbin you, you must be cautious\nTo stand up on yo' game and pimping these crows you must be flawless\nLike Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy\nMy nigga you know of I wanna be playing but running up on me like you miss me\nYou catchin the wrong vibe, packing yo' shit and rolling yo' eyes back\nFlexing up on the corner tossing your dice and rolling your Cadillac\nBut man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga\nDon't expect me to be pimping get your index off the trigger\nAs we bust, us, we leaving em in the dust\nSo keep that clean up out of your nose I said my piece and then I hush\nAs the candidate keeps flippin... niggas dippin...\n\n\n\n\n\nI really be love it we are gathered to life\nSo pissed to lather we come clean\nSome issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean\nOh like Liberty Bells yes them bullets keep on rangin\nOn fire like the Georgia mass choir we keep on singing\nBringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green\nLight and we ain't gonna stop until we hit the big screen\nPsych because no one is free when others are oppressed\nSo, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest\nGrowing old\n\nLike some eagles, people don't understand\nJust like their parents don't be carin\nI'm speaking about you playing with that phony stuff you sharing\nin your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches\nThinkin you got it, but get it get it, but you ain't pimping no bitches\nCause you flaw, in, falling like leaves into driveways\nIsn't it lovely smocking good and sloppy head on highways\nFriday's are tight but Saturday just makes it old\nWhen tonight's are hot warm enough to feed your soul\nGrowing old\n\n\n(\"96 gonna be that year...\")\n\n(Like memories of yesterday...)\n\n\nsee all them leaves must fall down, growing old\n\nFat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab\nSores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab\nTrees bright and green turn yellow brown\nAutumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growing old\n",
