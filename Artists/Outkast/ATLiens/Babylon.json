    "lyrics": "I came into this world high as a bird\nFrom second hand cocaine powder\nI know it sounds absurd\nI never tooted but its in my veins\nWhile the rest of the country bungies off bridges\nWithout no snap back\nand bitches they say they need that\nTo shake they fannies in the ass clubs\nthey go the other route\nturn each other out\nburn each other out\nwhere a bonified nigga like me\ncan't even get no back rub these days\nain't that bleak on they part\nbut let me hold it down\ncause they shut you down\nwhen you speak from your heart\nnow that's hard\nwhile we ranting and raving bout gats\nnigga they made them gats\nthey got some shit that'll blow out our backs\nfrom where they stay at\n\n\n\nOoooh, I fear the battle's just begun\nOoooh, though we're here someday we will be gone\nso I'm hoping, wishing, praying\nto keep my faith in you, in you\n\n(yo, yo, yo in background)\n\nI'm fascinated by the way yo\nnipples peak at me through yo blouse\nfreaky me, freaky you\ncan't help but be aroused\n'scuse me lord less for thinking\nbut that's the way we was brought up\nsneaking to watch playboy at night\nwe all must be caught up in worldly ways\nChemistry between boys and girls\nis a lot like when we went to the woods\nand laid with the squirrels\nduring P.E., we'd be\nexploring each others privates\nhunching with all our clothes on\nuntil we felt excited then, aaaah\noh now its on from here on out\nput yo hands in the atmosphere\nif you know what I'm talking bout\nnow if two hearts done walk on out\nand I see you on the next song\nthey call it horny\nBecause its devilish\nnow see we dead wrong\n\n\n\nPeople don't know the stress I'm dealing with day to day\nSpeaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Rene\nMoping around and wondering where she stay\nsaw her last that she lay\ngive it another day I say\nbut the lord he taketh away\nnow give it back lawd\ncause that's like backboards without the rims\nme and my auntie was tight like southwest\nbefore the pinks moved in\nlike the niggas who owned the liquor store\ncrack cocaine, pimps and whores\nliving up on this earth\nbefore a nigga like daddy was born\nbut they be making a scene\nthat my music and crime are a team\nbut I'm speaking the truth not dreams\nso what in the fuck they mean\nmy lyrics ain't clean\n",
