If niggaz all dogs, then what you call broads?\nFelines in heat, meowin for some yawn balls\nNow you and hear done got to drankin\nOh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drink\nand your girl done got to thinkin\nShe talkin bout, \"Girl you look so beautiful\"\nYou say thank you bein nice you try to change the subject\nWant some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit\nmixed with a chihuahua how much meaner can you get?\nDon't let her have her way with you she's gonna have a fit\nYou're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit\nhere's what you do -- you\ngrab her by her neck, throw her on the wall\nSay, \"Bitch don't ever disrespect me never not at all\"\nThese simple words can put a pause to half of the applause\nThem black ball laws of balance at all cost\n\nMamacita, papadonna\n\n\nQue pasa, que pasa? Check this out\nQuiet nights like this, might twist one for the moda\non the balcony, I got a sofa\nNights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly\nCan you come over, somethin, I wanna show ya\nTold ya once we was gon' take a trip, touch you\nwith my lips where you like it, it's time, don't fight it\nPiggy-back ride to the sofa, in the microwave\nI got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much\nI want ya, fuck flowers\nThe ceremony starts from the shower with the water\nI got somebody's daughter in the Doctor headquarters, chillin\nPrepare for this sex drillin, she said somethin in Spanish\nGot me feelin mannish, me and you fin' ta vanish\nreal quick, feel this shit, got cheese, tryin to make cheese\nto get you pregnant overseas\nMaybe make sho' that's my seed\nQuiet nights like this, bachelor like me is single\nTalkin to you Miss Bilingual\nLet's mingle in the crowd, watch them show, pop some Moet\nTryin to get you so wet, never been to Spain\nNever been a lame, horny, ever since I been a tiny\nFuckin with niggaz with ageless bodies\nTalkin to me, while I squeeze it bare\nLet me talk to you while I run my fingers through your hair\n\nMamacita, papadonna\n\n\nFriday night boi, breakin the old school out, boi we cruisin\nBout fo' niggaz and fo' hoes, it ain't gon be nobody losin\nbut they choosin\nBetter get in where you fit in cause it's crucial\nI'm tryin to cut bout two of them girls\ncause that just what I'm used to\nI mean that, the first that look my way\njust gon' get splack packed\nTo the front to the back there's Cognac\nGot my throat, burnin like burlap\nEverybody cheezin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like pleasers\nThese hookers they praisin my crew\nlike Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus\nThe easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie\nshe thought we was some motherfuckin genies\nSo I checked her, like the king I am, no disrespect intended\nTold her, and her silly friends,\n\"Get out\" before they got offended\nTo the Laquinta we went, layin them hoes down\non the freestyle tip, geyeah!\n\nMamacita, papadonna\n\nPermecito, senorita, mamacita\nMira mira, what's your name? Maria\nSame as mi tia, de Colombia\nI don't, in Atlanta, Georgia\nAnd you don't think I got nuttin for ya?\nYou must be crazy\nI'm out here tryin to feed my baby\nLil Bre, can't you see? Sheeyit\nDo it one more time, sheeyit\n",
