You wanna hear the new song we just did? It's not finished but... yeah

I want to go

Baby let's go
To my treehome
Treehome

Special
So let's go
Lets go oh oh
Oh, lets go
I wanna go
(Mmm)
Treehome
(Bridge!)

Coming for you
Oh yeah, we won't stop
You're my favorite crayon in the box
Lets think outside the lines
Come to my tree house, yeah
Let's escape then let me go head first
And from what I've heard, it's great
It's great

(There's a party)
Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a full tray
Can you pack your PJs?
(There's a party)
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be special
(I'm special baby)
No one ever comes here

Tuesday is good news day
Not usually a full tray
Can I pack your PJs?
You must be special
Come into my treehome
Boy, you must be
(Let's just escape)
(Let's go to my tree house baby)
Special

Let's just escape
Will you come into my tree house?
