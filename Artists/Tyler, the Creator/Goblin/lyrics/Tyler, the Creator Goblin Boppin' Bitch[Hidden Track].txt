So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch 
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch 

This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than a mother slut fucks for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked her too, yeah she’s a comeback
Fill her with a bunch of shit I purchased at the drug store
Four more door looking sluts let me explore
Till my cock got sore and started growing cold sores

Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's cause
She's a boppin' bitch 
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She's a boppin' bitch 

This little hoodrat started jockin at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with

Now why can't we fuck with this bitch? (She's boppin')
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch? (That bitch is boppin')
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? (She boppin')
She, what does she be doin'? (She boppin')

Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'mma kill this bitch
She's a boppin' bitch
