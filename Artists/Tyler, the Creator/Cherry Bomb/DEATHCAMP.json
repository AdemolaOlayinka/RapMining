How are you? I'm the sergeant\"\nAnd who I are isn't really important\nMy heart is as dark as a window with car tint\nSo hop in with your friends, yellin' out \"unpark it\"\nAnd I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick\nIt's young T\nI don't like to follow the rules\nAnd that's just who I am\nI hope you understand\nAnd I don't really think y'all cool\nSo give yourself a hand\nNo, no, give yourself a hand\nBetter pose for that camera\nBetter pose, boy you better pose\nAnd it's your life nigga I suppose\nFor the lights, for the camera, and the action\nNow you're face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights\nNigga you ask for this life\nWelcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nYeah, welcome to death camp\nKissing on my bean bag\nYour lips half on my tongue\nMoonwalk through your hair\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\nThis is fun I can tell\nI don't know if you'll handle it well\nWelcome to hell camp\n(Lights, and the camera, and the action)\nYou should be mine in a way tonight\n(For the lights, and the camera, and the action)\n",
