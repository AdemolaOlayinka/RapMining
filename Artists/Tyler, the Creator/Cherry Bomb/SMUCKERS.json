    "lyrics": "For your boy\nI'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor\nI'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors nigga\n\nMoney, money, money, money, money ain't the motive\nWhat's your name again? Nobody knows it\nDon't speak to me nigga, you not important\nI'm focused\nThey say I'm nutty, picnic basket\nNot short of a sandwich\nA peanut butter, Boyce Watkin's a faggot\nPlease come and get me\nSaid I suck him at your neck\nLike a hickey, boy I'm sicky\nLike a HIV victim , man nobody fuckin' with me\nI got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me demon\nAnd a terrorist, God dammit I couldn't believe it\nBan a kid from the country, I never fall, never timber\nBut you fucked up as a parent, your child idol\u2019s a nigger\nI clearly don't give a fuck, say you could run that shit back\nAnd fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat\nCherry Bomb, the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound\nAnd that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round\nDamn, bout to drop, gas em up, thick exhaust\nYoung T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft\nWe ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves\nTyler the Creator sweatin' Jesus juice\nPut that fuckin' cow on my level, cause I'm raisin' the stakes\nMom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8\nWhen we ate its the steaks, now our section is great\nCause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass em a plate\nYe!\n\nWhy, why, why?\nWhy don't they like me?\nCause Nike gave lot of niggas checks\nBut I'm the only nigga ever to check Nike\n\nRicher than white people with black kids\nScarier than black people with ideas\nNobody can tell me where I'm headin'\nBut I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding\nThey say I'm crazy but that's the best thing going for me\nYou can't Lynch Marshawn, and Tom Brady throwin' to me\nI made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of em\nI believe you like a fat trainer takin' a bite or somethin'\nI wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds\nI dream't of 2Pac, he asked me \"are you still down?\"\n\"Yeah my nigga\", Its on, its on, its on, its on\nI know they told their white daughters don't bring home Jerome\nI am the free nigga archetype\nI am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon\nIt's funny when you get extra money\nEvery joke you tell just be extra funny\nI mean you can even dress extra bummy\nCocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny\nAnd I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me\nOxford want a full blown lecture from me\nAnd the Lexus pull up, skrrtt like hop, I'd hopped out, wassup\nErg erg erg, step back, hold up, my leg'll be stuck\nI studied the proportions, emotions runnin' out of Autobahn\nSpeed level, had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God\nHe said \"I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard\"\n\nFor your boy\nI'm tryna pop the McLaren with the vertical doors\nI'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks got a trampoline in my room\nDamn\n\nTwo, Three, Four\nHold your fuckin' horses\nNiggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it\nLike I bet it at an auction been exhausted\nI been workin' while y'all cylinders smoke like broken exhaust tips\nFuckin' losers\n\nHold your fuckin' ponies my homie\nI whip your donkey by my lonely I eat pussy like Shoney's\nThat's Tunechi, homie, master of ceremonies\nI knock 'em down, domino effect, no pepperoni\nI swear\n\nThis them golf boys, like them hot boys\nFor the nine, 9 and 2,000, but its the 2,000\nWhen the one four and the one five, yo what up Wayne\n(What up Slime, nigga go hard)\nYeah, I'mma go hard like before Cain\nGot too much drive, need like ten lanes\nLife is a broad and she give brain\nThat's that road head, that's a dream car\nGot a four ten, of that same year I was born\nThat's that one nine nine one, 'nother nigga like I\nYou won't find one, cuz nigga I'm a god, a divine one, Tune\n\nMy trigger finger wise but my nine dumb\nMiddle finger blind so its fuck A-N-Y one\nFuck, skate and die son, a hundred ways to die son\nI'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump\nUse Adderall like alarm clocks wake my high up\nSteaks are high well done and prime cut, eat up\nI stick my rollie in her mouth, let the time come\nShe got hair like Shanaynay, and eyes like Wonda\nOh my goodness\n\nWayne them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy\nYe we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles\nBitch I'm goin' harder than yellow cabby stoppin' for Lionel\n(Black ass nigga)\nThey be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling\nBoy lets get a scrimmage, I'll cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers\nAnd a couple owners, that's kinda German\nYou bring the nooses, and a couple trees\nWhere the money grow, and (get) bodies burning\nCuz I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin\nOr some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham\nI need music all over the street like Erick Sermon\nWas, fuck us, maybe we should team up\nAnti Golf boys cuz I don't fuck with me either\nI'mma liar, I'mma faggot\n\nSon you need Jesus\nBut I heard he left sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus, well\nI'm prayin' for the new Yeezys\nAnd you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchinis\nI know, it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame\nOr lame, nor strange\n\nNah faggot its Golf Wang\n",
