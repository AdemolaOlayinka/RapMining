Just take me to the gun store\nI don't got enough time for you bum ass niggas\nI choke your dad, hit your mom, cuz I don't know that nigga\nCome and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off\nNigga, I'mma goddamn pilot\nAnd I decide when we gon' take off\nLet's get it\n\nTie the knot\nKick the chair\nStrangled in the air\nIt's cherry bomb\nYou muthafuckas want wolf?!\nThey're like \"this that cherry bomb\"\nI'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow\nYou fire me up, I lose control\nGOLF 191, Okaga\nClassic hits\n",
