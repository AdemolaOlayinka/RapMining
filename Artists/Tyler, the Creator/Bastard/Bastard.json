    "lyrics": "This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep\nSome food for thought some food for death, go 'head and fuckin' eat\nMy father's dead well I don't know, we'll never fuckin' meet\nI cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed\nSomebody call the pastor, this bastard is so posessed\nThis meetin' just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son\nMy mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent\nThat I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckas\nAre much important I'm gettin' angrier while recordin'\nI'm feelin' like the Bulls, I've got a Gang of Wolves\nOdd Future is children that's fucked up on they mental\nSimple but probably not, fuck 'em\nI'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck\nDrunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked\nSuspended from school coolest nigga without effort\nEasy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard\nSoak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on\nCause this album packs enough evil\nThat you can't fit inside a jansport, go to school with this\nI go from AP to JC inside of fuckin' week\nWakin' up with random girls like \"Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?\"\nI stay with grandma, she always bitchin' about her carpet\nEvery time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit\nNo to drugs I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honour classes\nBy those slow as molasses, take this shit to school\nRaquel treat me like my father like a fuckin' stranger\nShe still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her\nNot put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler\nAll because she said no to homecomin', demons runnin'\nInside my head tellin' me evil thoughts\nI'm the dream catcher but nothin' but nightmares I caught, go to sleep\nI wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky\nFuck me the monster said, some how the monster's dead\nInside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil\nWith this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble\nI'm on my grind feeble, my music is evil\nMy fuckin' samples are too illegal, play this shit in church\nI graduated without honors or a fuckin' father\nHe died, no bitch, don't even fuckin' bother\nI wanted a brother my mother I told her\nBut instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada\nSo both of our imaginations are creations of the fuckin' situation\nThat's havin' our brains racin' like Dayton, wearin' some fuckin' heelies\nI know you fuckin' feel me, I want to fuckin' kill me\nBut times I'm so serious you think I'm silly\nI'm doin' Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11\nSeven. What's religion nigga? I am Legend\nI roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition\nI created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented\nThan 40 year old rappers talkin' 'bout Gucci\nWhen they have kids they haven't seen in years, impressin' their peers\nWith the same problem, the only way to solve them\nIs to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver\nLife's a salad I'mma toss it eat that shit up, Rick Ross it\nShit it out, bag it up sell it, I'm so damn rebellious\nCause my mother let me do what I want\nShe wasn't careless, protective she is the bear\nThe shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid\nMy father didn't give a fuck, so it's somethin' I inherit\nMy mom's all I have so it's never meet the parents\nWhen Danielle or Malonda decide to fuckin' share\nThis confused boy, I wanna hug all ya, I\u2019m bad for you kids to listen to\nSoy is not the choice, I'm bad milk, drink it\nMy wrist is all red from the cutter\nDrippin' cold blood like the winter, the summer\nIs never that's equivalent to me and Sarah\nWell that's not her fuckin name, but I think this shit is clever\nMy niggas wanna know if I'm fuckin', if I'm kissin'\nBut I'm sittin' here downin' beers simply just wishin'\nWith tear they try to tell me but I never listen\nCause I don't give a shit like sittin' down pissin'\nEighteen, still talkin' to imaginaries\nHopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy\nLosers can never win me, you can never offend me\nMy goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully momma will attend the\nCeremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal\nThis my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this\nFuck a deal, I just want my father's email\nSo I can tell him how much I fuckin' hate him in detail\n",
