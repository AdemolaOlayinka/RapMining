Uncle Jay\nloves you to death won't let no trouble come your way\nOh, can't forget my man down in Maryland\nHe's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?\nTell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra\nAnd your son too - there's nothin I won't do\nUnless you was me, how could you judge me?\nI was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me\nPolice pursued me, chased cuffed and subdued me\nTalked to me rudely; cause I'm young rich and I'm black\nand live in a movie, not livin by rules\nNew rap patrollin the city, follow my crews\nBleek you're still with me - nigga what did I say?\nThe time is comin; you one hit away\nBeans I ain't tryin to change you - just give you some game\nto make the transition, from the street to the fame\nMy momma loves me..\n",
