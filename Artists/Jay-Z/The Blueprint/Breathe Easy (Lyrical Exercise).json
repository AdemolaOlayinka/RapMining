Once you memorize a sentence\nIt's like an exercise\n\n\n\n\nYa niggas can't be serious right now\nI'm the all time heavy weight champion of flowers\nI'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now\nBest flow, Most consistent, Realest stories\nMost charisma, I set the most trends\nAnd my interviews are hotter\nHolla\n\nI jog in the graveyard\nSpar in the same ring\nNow it's house by the building\nWhere Malcolm X was slain\nI spring train in the winter\nRound early December\nRun suicide drills over and over\nWith the weight of the world on my shoulder\nThat's why they call me \"Hova\"\nI'm far from being God\nBut I work goddamn hard\nI wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep\nI'm catching my second wind the second the first one end\nI am \"focused man\"\nAnd I'm not afraid of death\nAnd I'm going all out\nI circle the vultures in a van and\nI run the block (run)\nPull up in a drop (pull up)\nPush up on my money (push up)\nI'm in great shape dunny\nI keep jacks jumping thirty six sets\nLike a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch\nI pump and rock sweats\nAll white trainers\nThe ghettoes, Billy Blanks\nI show you niggas what pain is\nMaintain your stamina\nHov will damage ya\nSpot you two rhymes y'all niggas is amateurs\nThe fifth\nA dead lift if\nNiggas don't want to get shot then y'all niggas better squat\nI drop your set for rep\nNo need to hit the showers\nThe spit from the fifth leave you wet\nLyrical exercise\n\nY'all niggas ain't tired right?\n\n\nOne, One\nTwo, Two\nThree, Three\nFour, Breathe Easy\n\nSuckers\nGet your weight up\nNot your hate up\nJigga man is diesel\nWhen I lift the eight up\nY'all ain't ready to workout with the boy\nYour flow is brain on drugs\nMines is rap on steroids\nI lift every voice when I sing\nMy ability\nMake yours look like an exercise in futility\nBring your squad\nBiceps, Triceps, and Quads\nWe don't struggle with undeveloped muscles\nY'all ain't real\nThat's y'all Achilles Heel\nSame routine when you see me you know the drill\nI spot ya\nI lift the weight of the watch off your arm\nRemain nice and calm\nPut down your things\nTrinidad of the game know my way around your ring\nNo matter how many pounds you bring\nIt sounds like the same old thing\nR-O-C is the strongest team\n",
