Guess who's back?\nSince this is a new era, got a fresh new hat\nTen year veteran, I've been set\nI've been through with this bullshit game but I never quit\nI used to think rapping at 38 was ill\nBut last year alone I grossed 38 mill'\nI know I ain't quite 38 but still\nThe flow so (Special) got a (38) feel\nThe real is back, hehehehe\n",
