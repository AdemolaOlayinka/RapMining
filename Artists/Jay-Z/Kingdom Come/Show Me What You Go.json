I'm sorry!\nI'm back..hehehe\nUH, huh uh, lets go get 'em Just\n\n\nHEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY\nShow me what you got, lil mama\nShow me what you got, pretty lady\nShow me what you got, shorty\nShow me what you got, baby\nHands up and.. waves, waves, waves, waves\n\n\nGive the drummer some\nI already gave the summer some\nIt's the winter's turn\nHovie Hov is the coldest, I'm just getting better with time\nI'm like Opus One\nYoung, no two alike like a snowflake\nOK! Show me what you got baby\nWords is slurring engine purring\nMami fronting but I'm so determined\nShots of Patron, now she's in the zone\nI ain't talking about the two-three\nMami in the zone like the homie 2-3\nJordan or James, makes no difference\nBoo I'm balling the same\nI am the Mike Jordan of recording\nYou might want to fallback from recording\nBut you right it's not important\nSo it forced him to go for the hype\nFor being brave and may applaud him\nWell misery I will assure them\nOh baby just ignore them\nTruth or dare mami listen and learn\nI got a drop I just took off the top, it's your turn\n\n\n\n\nH.O.V.A., gold bottles of that ace of spade\nWhy even fool with these other guys, they all stingy\nAll these dudes know how to say is gimme\nGimme some head, gimme some brain\nGimme your number, gimme your name\nBut if I get one night baby girl I swear\nI'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here\nI'll take you shopping, take long trips\nI'll take the cork off, you can take sips\nI'll take you there, take my time\nTake you clothes off, I'll take off mine\nMa, show me what you got\nHovie in the spot tried to told you I was hot\nTell these other dudes it's a wrap\nGet the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!\nY'all got less than 2 months to get y'all thing together\nGood luck!\n\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen the most incredible!\nH-O, uh huh\nH-O, uh huh\nIs back!\nJustin Blaze\nYou Blaze that\nRoc-A-Fella Records\nDynasty continues, y'all die\nUh Huh, peace!\n",
