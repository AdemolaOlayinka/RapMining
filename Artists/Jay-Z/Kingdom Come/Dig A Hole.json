I made it possible\nFor niggahs to make history, How is the possible?\nPlease explain this shit to me, How is it logical?\nHave we forgot our history? lets open our bibles\nIts like the disciples dissing Jesus becoming his rivals\nShunning teh one thing that they owe their life to\nYou let that man hype you to go against your idol\nKnowing good and god damn well this what I do\nThink I'm in the office I lost my grind\nThats how kids become orphans, YOU LOST YOUR MIND!?\nI keep my enemies close\nI give 'em enough rope\nThey put themselves in the air\nI just kick away the chair\n\nUH\nUH\nWe gon' see now\nUH HUH\nWe gon' see clown\nDig a hole\nDig a hole\nGo 'head, burry yourself\nDig a hole\nDig a hole\nGo 'head, Burry yourself\n\nHov gon' get you, I aint forget your little disrespect\nNO Hov, daddy gon' spank your for that shit you said\nIt's hard to do, when you got nothin to prove\nEverbody know you better, you in a lose lose\nEven if you win, ultimately you lose\nReal niggahz like, \"why Hov talkin to dude\"\nHe's sellin low too\nOnly time you went plat\nMy chain was around yout neck, thats an actual fact\nSo I'm praying that it spills outside of the Booth\nThats when y'all niggahz outside of your truth\nOutside of your league, thats not what you do\nNiggahz throwing ROC signs outside of your coupe\n\nDun look at Hove like he dun somethin wrong to em\nHe just took what belong to em\nNiggahz playing Checkers wid Chess playing Hov\nThis game is over I dunno if y'all know\nYou in a hole\n\nWe gon' see now\nUh Huh\nWe gon' see clown\nDig a hole\nDig a hole\nGo 'head, burry yourself\nDig a hole\nDig a hole\nGo 'head, burry yourself\n",
