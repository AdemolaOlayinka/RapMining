    "lyrics": "I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in\nThirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in\nReally a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin\nbut when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck\nIgnorant bastard, I'm takin it back to day one\nNo kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun\nFor niggaz that think I spend my days in the sun\nwell here's the shock of your life, the glock not the mic\nHomey I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street\nYou still fuckin up then trust me I still creep\nYeah I know the platinum chain be lookin real sweet\nbut reach and I bury niggaz sixty feet deep\nS dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs\nSeperate fathers from they daughters, why bother\nI'm a crook like you, I took like you\nI disobeyed the law threw out the book like you\nHow dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like boo\nI keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me..\n\nCOME AND GET ME!\nKa-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come..\nCOME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka-COME AND GET ME! ..\nCOME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka..\n.. Ka-ka-ka-ka-come\n.. come and get me COME AND GET ME\n\n\nDon't know what y'all niggaz is\ntryin to do but I don't like it\nYeah, straight gangster shit\nHeyyyy, uh-huh-uh-uhh gangster shit\nUhh, straight gangster nigga\nRoc..\n\nYo, your summer's bout to get hot\nNiggaz home from jail and they plottin\nHeard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top\nThe Continental T, got em resentin me\nGod I work hard, please don't envy me\nI paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard\nI can recall a year ago I almost lost this job\nAll y'all remember is the part about me parkin the hog\nWhat about all them days I was walkin my dogs?\nBarkin at broads, but they never hollered back\nAnd if they did all they said was, \"Where dem dollaz at?\"\nImagine, bein skinny growin up around broader cats\nThe quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats\nuntil I got a gat and loudly start poppin back\nRound the way, niggaz called me Bobby Bouchete\nNow all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay\nHow y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away\nPull out your gat, car jack me take my cruise away\nWell I got news for y'all fools today, hey..\n\n\nI got, shots to give come and get me nigga\nY'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga\nI won't, part with this come and get me nigga\nI worked, hard for this come and get me nigga\nI got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME..\nCOME AND GET ME..\n\n\nI made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good\nI ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood\nMade em relate to your struggle, told em bout your hustle\nWent on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you\nYou know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin witchu\nTil I made em understand why you do what you do\nI expected to hear, \"Jay, if it wasn't for you..\"\nBut instead, all I hear is buzzin in your crew\nHow y'all scheamin, tryin to get accustomed to my moves\nSo y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house\nBut I got pride I'm a nigga first\nI gotta cock back and pull the trigger first\nThat's how Jigga work\nThe funny thing; I represent y'all everytime I spit a verse\nand that's the shit that hurts\nBut hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here\nSo when y'all feel that the time is right..\n\n\n\n\nAiy yo yo, aiy yo yo\nIt's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle\nI'm treatin it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna\nMy game change but my mindframe remains the same\nI gotta protect what's mine\nShit I started from nothin; zero, zip\nI made my way hustlin, I don't owe niggaz shit\nI'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped\nCats I played skelly with? Niggaz done flipped\nI keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip\nTwo in the stash, one come up when I shift\nI keep one under the chair where I sit\nI even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch\nAsk Big; everytime he'd come to my crib\nhe'd find another gun that I hid\nI'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is\nEveryday like a hundred-and-six.. shit..\n\n\n\n\nMotherfuckers!\n",
