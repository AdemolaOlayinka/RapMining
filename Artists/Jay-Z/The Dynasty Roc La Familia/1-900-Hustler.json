This Chris out the Young Guns dog\nWhattup?\nI'm ready to smash these niggaz in the rap game\nThe niggaz takin too long with that advance money and shit\nYeah\nTalkin 'bout chill, chill don't pay the bills\nYeah I feel that\nI know you well connected dog\nLet me holla at somebody real\nAight look, I got the perfect person for you, hold on\nBleek, line two\n\n\nListen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word\nI ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd\nYou find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first\nIf you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first\nYou new in town, no red and blue in town, there's gangs\nDon't get fresh, let 'em know you small change\nThe strong move quiet, the weak start riots\nWe know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired\nWith no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish\nand other niggaz who gettin it - DEAD IT\nMake 'em an offer that they can't refuse\nHe resists, box him in, til he can't be moved\nHere's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it\nGet in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic\n900-Hustler, you pass it around\nWanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out\n\n\n1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your dog\nWhat seem to be the problem young boy?\nYo whattup, this Murder Def Kill Homicide Nigga\n(??) I got two freaks\nYo watch your fuckin mouth man\nFuck you mean watch my mouth nigga?\nBeen on hold for about two hours nigga\nI don't give a fuck how long you been on the line;\nshut the fuck up! Matter of fact, hold on\n\nI know this nigga ain't just put.. put me on hold man\nThis bullshit-ass elevator music\nFree, pick up line five\n\n\nFirst things first, watch what you say out your mouth\nwhen you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers\nNever play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch\nwhen you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers\nNever hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out\nif a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya\nLay low, get cake, whip all over the state\nStash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (hoe!)\nNigga too close went right around his place (yo!)\nYou stoppin dough when we clutchin the gats?\nI know you heard \"Friend or Foe,\" this ain't different from that\nMake sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like\nYoung, Jon Benet doin a mission tonight and yo\nuntil you up stay away from them dice and whores\nThree smuts, two streaks and a dyke\ncan pause one-three rumbles two streaks and a pipe for sure\nAnd if it's tight, then he might come back for more\nNine and four, everyday back and forth\nWinter to summer, 1-900-Hustler\nPass the number til you're stackin balls\nTell you how to weigh shit wet and package more\nI take cash or write the check out to F-R\ntwo E's, that'll be two G's\nAnd forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga\n\n\n1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy dog\nYo whattup young, you put me on hold earlier man what happened\nYeah you stupid motherfucker Watch your mouth man\nyou talkin all reckless on the phone\nFuck you think this the,\nGet-Indicted-Hotline or somethin motherfucker?\nYo, my bad man, my bad\nI know I was talkin reckless earlier about them two chickens\nYou get it, you know, two chickens? But listen\nWhat?\nJust tell me how to move this shit man\nI'm pushin hardly half a wing back nigga, holla\nGet a job, holla at Perdue!\n",
