Magna Carta... Holy Grail
2013)
Hey sucka nigga
Where ever you are
I thought about ya fool
While I was driving my car
I wonder if you fools
Realize how far
You are
You're no where in my rear mirror
Your last shit ain't better
Than my first shit
Your best shit
Ain't better than my worst shit
The truth in my verses
Versus
Your metaphors
About what your net worth is
