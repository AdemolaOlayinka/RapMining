I'm in the Maybach\nThis ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks\nThis is black leather pants and a pair of stance\nSocks is my synopsis is clear\nGot stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear\nTeacher teacher, I trying to unteach ya\nAll the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers\nWhen you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees\nYou front row every where, you in the H.O.V's\nJordan 1's and dungarees\nAnd that's just the half of my warpath\nMake a million another million let my niggas make a million\n'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling\nWe have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top\nCause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop\n",
