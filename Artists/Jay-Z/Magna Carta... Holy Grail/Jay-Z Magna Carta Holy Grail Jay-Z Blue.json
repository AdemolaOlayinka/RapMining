A daughter.\nWho cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her.\nAs she cares about me.\n\nLet's do this for these babies\nMercedes truck, fuck\nHouses on acres\nBlatantly ballin' on HD\nY'all need to step up y'all AV\nLife changed again I was already taking off\nMy flight changed again\nSlight change of winds\nIt's barely 12 noon\nAnd my wife changed again\nBaby needs Pampers\nDaddy needs at least three weeks in the Hamptons\nPlease don't judge me, only hugged the block\nI thought my daddy didn't love me\nMy baby getting chubby\nCue that Stevie Wonder music, aww isn't she lovely\nNow I'm staring at praying that things don't get ugly\nAnd I'm stuck in that old cycle\nLike wife leaves hubby\nFuck joint custody\nI need a joint right now\nJust the thought alone fucks with me\n\nHigh on life\nI could die from the fall\nImagine if I hit the floor\nApologies in order\nTo Blue Ivy my daughter\nIf it was up to me\nYou would be with me\nSort of like daddy dearest\n\nDon't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.\n\nI dream filthy (my mom and pops) mixed me with Jamaican\n(Rum and whiskey) what a set off (What a set off)\nAnd I know I'm not perfect baby\nI been through so much trauma\nIt gonna be hard to reverse it\nWith some doctors and some nurses maybe\nTeach me on how to treat a lady\nOpen doors on the 'Cedes\nThis relationship shit is complicated\nAll I know is we ain't speaking everyday\nI fucking hate it\nI don't wanna duplicate it\nI seen my mom and pop drive each other motherfuckin' crazy\nAnd I got that nigga blood in me\nI got his ego and his temper\nAll is missing is the drugs in me\n\n\nFather never taught me how to be a father\nTreated mother I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another\nBaby with no daddy want no mama drama I just wanna\nTake her back to a time when\nEverything was calmer\nOut in Paris on a terrace\nWatching the Eiffel Tower\nAnd a Ferris wheel yet and still\nNothing could prepare us\nFor the beauty that you be Blue be\nLooking in your eyes is like a mirror\nHave to face my fears\nCheer up\nWhy could you just be happy\nWithout these back and forth thoughts\nYou too much like your daddy\nBadly I just wanna spent more time with him\nSadly life wouldn't let me get around with him\nNow I got my own daughter\nTaught her how to take her first steps\nCut the cord watch her take her first breath\nAnd I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared\nBut in life and death\nIf I isn't there\n",
