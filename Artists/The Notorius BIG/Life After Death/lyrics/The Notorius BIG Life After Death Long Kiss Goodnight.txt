The Notorius B.I.G
Life After Death
1997)
TIME, TIME FOR YOU To DIE
AS I KISS--YOur--ASS--GOODNIGHT

I make your mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Little Cease
Nigga please
Blood floods your dungarees
And that's just a half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
than the average player hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice
They see me in the streets they be like you he nice
But that's on the low doe'
be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out 4-4's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas
snort-cane niggas
extortion came quicker
Bought the Range' nigga
You still tickle me
I used to be as strong as ripple, till Little Cease crippled me
Now I play hard-like my girls nipples be
The games sour like like a pickle be
You all know the rules
Move from BK to New Jerus
Thinking 'bout, all the planes we flew
Bitches, we ran through
Now the years new
I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad 'cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit's strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed you
I ain't mad at you (we ain't mad at you)
Blood rushing, concussions, ain't nothing
Catch cases, come out fronting
Smoking something
Sipping White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumping
I laced it wit the basic
6 TV's, a system, knocking Mase shit, face it
We hard to hit
Guard your shit, for I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the "P"
Mix shots, "work your seat up"
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
LONG KISS



UH-I flaming gats, aiming at, these fucking...
Maniacs put my name in raps--"support them"
Games dat
Like they hustle backwards
I smoke backwards, and Duchees
Ya can't touch me
Try to rush me
Slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleeding lovely, with you, spirit above me
or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms-n-the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the holy ghost
I put holes in most, you hold your toast shakey
Slip-n-trying to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blue
My team in the Marine blew, six-coupe
Skiid it out, weeded out, clean it out
The block for distance is, given long kisses bitch



Frank White the menacing, craw-craw's demenacin
I got the lettuce in
You turn green like cucumber skin got the new hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
then drugs and mac-10's
Hug from fake friends
Make ends they hate you, be broke girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke your ass 'til your face blue, make you
Open the safe too
No matter how you call it (how you call it)
This "bralick", alcoholic
Like his weed green'd out like his brick solid
Distribute to kids who, take heart like Valentine, drink Valentine, all the time
Slugs hit you chest tap the spine
Flat-line
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked foe times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe'
"Slink steal slow"
As you remorse we feel no
