Shit no!\nEven though they had me scared\nYo they gotta eight I gotta teck with air holes\n\nThat's just how the shit goes in the struggle mother fucker\n\nI don't wanna live no mo'\nSometimes I hear death knocking in my front do'\nI'm living everyday like a hustle\nAnother drug to juggle, another day another struggle\n",
