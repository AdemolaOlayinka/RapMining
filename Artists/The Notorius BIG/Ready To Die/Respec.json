Nah, couldn't see it\nScarface, King of New York, I wanna be it\nRap was secondary, money was necessary\nUntil I got incarcerated--kinda scary\nC74-Mark 8 set me straight\nNot able to move behind the great steel gate\nTime to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?\nAll the money I stacked was all the money for bail\n\n\n\nNinety-four, now I explore new horizons\nMama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'\nHoneys is tantalizin', they freak all night\nPeep duckin' cops on the creep all night\nAs I open my eyes and realizin' I changed\nNot the same deranged child stuck up in the game\nAnd to my niggas livin' street life\nLearn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest\nStill tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'\nIn the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slippin'\nIf I'm pimpin on The F with weed on my breath\nOriginal hustler with the muffler on the Tec\nRespect to the Mac's and the Ac's\nTo the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps\n",
