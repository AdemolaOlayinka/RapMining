(uh!)\nI don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya!\nI'm clockin ya, Versace shades watchin' ya! (uh-huh!)\nOnce ya grin, I'm in, game begin! (uh!)\nFirst I talk about how I dresses this,\nIn diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses! (whooo!)\nThe sex is just immaculate from the back I get\nDeeper and deeper! - Help ya reach the (uh-huh!)\nClimax that your man can't make\nCall him, tell him you'll be home real late, and sing the break!

(\"uhh, uhh! \")\nIsn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight\nHer flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds. (uh!)\nLyrically I'm supposed to represent (what?)\nI'm not only the client, I'm the player president! (uh!)\n\n\n\nBad Boy, Bad Boy!\n(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)\nEastCoast, EastCoast...\nWestCoast, WestCoast...\n",
