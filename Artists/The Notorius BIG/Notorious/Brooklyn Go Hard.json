WE GO HARD!!!!\n\n\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\n\n\nThis is black hoodie rap, there's no fear in my eyes where they lookin at\nBetter look on map, Besides, mi nah like to eye fight\nMi nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (CHRIST!!!)\nBut if a man test my Stuy, I promise he won't like my reply\nBoom Bye Bye like Buju I'm crucial\nI'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some gettin use to\nChain snatchin, ain't have it, gotta get it\nSame shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrididge\nFatherless child, mama put double shifts\nSo the number runners was the only one I hanged widith\nBefore you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith\nFit no orangutans piddeals ciddaps like orange's I'm dangerous\nPLEASE!!! Tell me what the name of this is\n\n\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)\n\n\nI father, I Brooklyn Dodger them\nI Jack, I Rob, I sin\nAwww man, I'm Jackie Robinson\nExcept when I run base, I dodge the pen\nLucky me, lucky we, they didn't get me\nNow when I bring the Nets I'm the Black Branch Ricky\nFrom Brooklyn corners, burnin branches of sticky\nSpread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie\nI pity, the fool with jewels like Mr. T\nWith long history in my borough, they borrow\nWith no intentions of returnin, tomorrow\nThe sun don't come out for many, like Annie\nHalf orphan, mama never had an abortion\nPapa sort of did, still I managed to live\nI go hard, I owe it all to the crib\nNow please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this!!!!\n\n\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (B-R-O-O-K!!!)\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!! (L-Y-N!! COME AGAIN!!!)\n\n\nWhile I'm doin my time due to circumstance\nCross that bridge is the consequence\nOnce pretend now I paid my dues\nRisk takers we break the rules\nGet so dark, but I see good\nBed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods\nNow, let it ring out, it's a warnin\n(BROOK-LYN!!!) Let it be sworn in\nGotta make it stick workin like we good color\nRip it to the core, underneath it or we oughta\nRight into the clip, bring it to the floor\nOne step one step give it up more\nAll this stuff and the streets are a mess\nWith big ass dreams and a sick death wish\nProbably like the commercials says\nKill the voice screamin in my head\n\n\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\n\n\nBrooklyn we go hard, we go hard!!!!\n",
