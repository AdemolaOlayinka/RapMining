Motherfucker better duck quick.\n'cause me and my dogs love to buck shit, fuck the luck shit strictly aim\nNo asperation to quit the game.\n\nSpit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,\nSqueeze your clip and hit the right one\nPass that weed l gotta light one\n\nAll them niggas l gotta fight one\nAll them hoes l gotta like one\nOur situation is a tight one\nWhat you wanna do? Fight or run?\n\n\n\n\nMaking money livin' marvelous, in god we trust,\nDon't too many niggas wanna start with us, got big guns in the cars with us,\nBust at any motherfucker acting hard with us,\nDon't really wanna show you what a G.I.B., I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.,\nWhen you hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G.,\nBrooklyn and K-town, when you checking out the flow, you know it's going rain with persistence,\n2 legends on the same track, 2 different plains of existence,\nLet's get it crackin' I love to bust flows, hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe,\nSpit it for the city I love Chicago, cali-coes buck, I love to bust those,\nYou think you can spit on the Mike like Biggie and flow just as steady as I,\nshit is real you know you love him,\nyou ain't got \"Ready to Die\", \"Life After Death\",\ngive to 'em, however you wanna nigga, that a day after, give it to you, however you wanna nigga,\n'cause the shit is giddie, so I carry big heat, screamin' come and get me,\nTwista and Biggie on the Swizz beat,\n3 mils I love to make 1, all these cars I love to ride 1,\nAll these hoes I love to cut 1,\na tribute to BIG,\nI love to bust 1,\n\n\n\n\nIn the middle of it hammer, bring niggas more drama than they baby mama, nigga wanna battle I will bomb you,\nOne man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta,\nNiggas always ready for war, they don't really wanna see a nigga though,\nWe can hit 'em in a minute, then be finished with 'em\nHit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o floor\nHere with Swizz, oh, no! Nigga's in trouble,\nSomebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them burners (yeah),\nAnd niggas you all heard of me, brick city killer, nigga word to me,\nAnd I'm passed that like Bernie Magic, with a jack that'll snatch that rep, and stack some, drag him,\nDouble on that back random, with the bullets stop brand him,\nFeeling hard you can't harass him,\nPut it up in your magic, catch the magnum flashing cannons, niggas ain't ready for this 1, '\ncause I'm on a mission to get even better than believe it I'm heavily heated,\nIt's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason.\n",
