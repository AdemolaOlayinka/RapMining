I couldn't see it,\nScarface king of New York, I wanna be it,\nRap was secondary, money was necessary,\nUntil I got incarcerated, kinda scary,\nC74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,\nTime to contemplate, damn were did I fail,\nAll the money I stacked, was all the money for bail,\n\nI remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was\nGoin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and\nDimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere,\n",
