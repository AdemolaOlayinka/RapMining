The Notorius B.I.G
Duets: The Final Chapter
2005)
1970 Somethin' nigga I don't sweat the date my moms was late,
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins,
In this world the fly girls, tangeray and hennesey,
Untill I call earl, 10 months in this gut, what the fuck,
I wish moms would hurry up, so I can get buck wild,
Juvenile with the mics n shit, New York New York, ready for the likes of this,
Then came the worst date, May 21st 2:19 was when my moma water burst,
No spouse in the house, so she rolled herself,
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help,
Umbilical cords wrapped around my neck,
Im seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step,
I made it out im bringin' mad joy,
The doctor looked and said he's gonna be BAD BOY!

I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere,

Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to god to reverse it I give my left eye,
With the right I visualized, the king of bed-stuy,
Checkin his daughter tianna into junior high,
If I was in brooklyn, and B.I. was still alive,in 2006 it might sound like this,
N.Y. 718 212, where sue's rendevouz,
Its like moulin rouge,
High fashion, up town air force ones,
And vasquez, puerto ricans with fat asses
Lace dutch masters, we dump ashes, on models and S classes,
For you bastards, catch a cab to manhattan,
With that broadway actin', u hype that belly shit,
Would u get u capped, and wrapped in plastic,
Tell the captain, ask Roge was happennin',
Out here nor speak no evil, inside the Magnum

I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time,

Now I'm 13 smokin' blunts, makin' green,
Or on the drug scene, fuck the football team,
Risk it, ruptured spleens, by the age of 16,
Hearin' the coach scream, make my lifetime dream,
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my doe up,
So school I didn't show up, and fuck my flow up,
Mom said that I should grow up, and check myself,
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself,
Put the drugs on the shelf, naww! I couldn't see it,
Scarface king of New York, I wanna be it,
Rap was secondary, money was necessary,
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary,
C74 mark 8, set me straight, not able to move behind a great steel gate,
Time to contemplate, damn were did I fail,
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail,

I remmember back in time, before all the homies died, before all the dollars and nines, I knew that I was
Goin' somewhere, let me take you back in time, before I even got the rhyme, before I had nickels and
Dimes, I knew that I was goin' somewhere,
