Notorious...


Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat,
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat,


Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,
squeeze your clip hit the right one,
pass that weed I got to light one,
Squeeze your clip
hit the right one,
pass that weed I got to light one,


Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us,
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious, thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us,
You all niggas be scrambling gambling, up in restaurants with mandolins and violins,
We're just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin,
High off weed and lots of gin, so much smoke need oxygen,
Steadily countin' them benjamins, nigga you should to if you knew what this game would do to you,
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I've been through,
So called beef with you know who, fucked a few female stars or two,
Then a bluelight niggas knew like
Mike-shit not to be fuck with. Motherfucker better duck quick.
'cause me and my dogs love to buck shit, fuck the luck shit strictly aim
No asperation to quit the game.

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clicks,
Squeeze your clip and hit the right one
Pass that weed l gotta light one

All them niggas l gotta fight one
All them hoes l gotta like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you wanna do? Fight or run?




Making money livin' marvelous, in god we trust,
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us, got big guns in the cars with us,
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us,
Don't really wanna show you what a G.I.B., I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P.,
When you hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G.,
Brooklyn and K-town, when you checking out the flow, you know it's going rain with persistence,
2 legends on the same track, 2 different plains of existence,
Let's get it crackin' I love to bust flows, hit it from the back 'cause I love to buck hoe,
Spit it for the city I love Chicago, cali-coes buck, I love to bust those,
You think you can spit on the Mike like Biggie and flow just as steady as I,
shit is real you know you love him,
you ain't got "Ready to Die", "Life After Death",
give to 'em, however you wanna nigga, that a day after, give it to you, however you wanna nigga,
'cause the shit is giddie, so I carry big heat, screamin' come and get me,
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz beat,
3 mils I love to make 1, all these cars I love to ride 1,
All these hoes I love to cut 1,
a tribute to BIG,
I love to bust 1,




In the middle of it hammer, bring niggas more drama than they baby mama, nigga wanna battle I will bomb you,
One man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta,
Niggas always ready for war, they don't really wanna see a nigga though,
We can hit 'em in a minute, then be finished with 'em
Hit 'em with the venom of a nigga with a sick-o floor
Here with Swizz, oh, no! Nigga's in trouble,
Somebody better call po-po, it's gonna be murder when I get to serving them burners (yeah),
And niggas you all heard of me, brick city killer, nigga word to me,
And I'm passed that like Bernie Magic, with a jack that'll snatch that rep, and stack some, drag him,
Double on that back random, with the bullets stop brand him,
Feeling hard you can't harass him,
Put it up in your magic, catch the magnum flashing cannons, niggas ain't ready for this 1, '
cause I'm on a mission to get even better than believe it I'm heavily heated,
It's easy to see it, if you wanna see me let that be the reason.
