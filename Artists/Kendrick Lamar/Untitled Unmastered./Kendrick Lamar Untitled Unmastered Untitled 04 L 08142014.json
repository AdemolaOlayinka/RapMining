If you don\u2019t, it\u2019s cool)\n\n(But) head is the answer, head is the future\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself\n(Don\u2019t tell them when you second guess yourself I need you in the kitchen now I forgot\u2026)\nCome on give me some help, yeah\nHead is the answer, head is the future\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself\nCome on, give me some help\n\nAnd I just wanna\nAnd I just wanna\nStraight up\nEyes with my head\nAnd I can\u2019t use some help\nStraight up\n\nHead is the future\n",
