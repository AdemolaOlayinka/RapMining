    "lyrics": "What money got to do with it\nWhen I don't know the full definition of a rap image?\nI'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it\nInstitutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit\nHol' up\nGet it back\nI said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it\nInstitutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?\n\nIf I was the president\nI'd pay my mama's rent\nFree my homies and them\nBulletproof my Chevy doors\nLay in the White House and get high, Lord\nWho ever thought?\nMaster take the chains off me\nLife can be like a box of chocolate\nQuid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious\nOh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it\nBitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive\nI can just alleviate the rap industry politics\nMilk the game up, never lactose intolerant\nThe last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious\nMe scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges\nBe all you can be, true, but the problem is\nA dream's only a dream if work don't follow it\nRemind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this\nI'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal\nK Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god\nTruthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged\nBut somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards\nYou lookin' at artists like the harvests\nSo many Rollies around you and you want all of them\nSomebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry\nI should've listened what my grandmama said to me\n\nShit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga\nShit don't change until you get up and wash your ass\nShit don't change until you get up and wash your ass nigga\nOh now, slow down\n\nAnd once upon a time in a city so divine\nCalled West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga\nHe was 5 foot something, God bless the kid\nTook his homie to the show and this is what they said\nWhat I'm s'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?\nThe convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips\nThe private jets and passports, presidential glass floor\nGold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for\nInstagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?\nOne more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist\nMy defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it\nIt's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?\nNo more livin' poor, meet my .44\nWhen I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor\nNow Kendrick, know they're your co-workers\nBut it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey\nNow I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay\nBut see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA\nRemember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?\nWell that's me at these awards\nI guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy\nShe said...\n\n\nAnd once upon a time in a city so divine\nCalled West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga\nHe was 5 foot something, dazed and confused\nTalented but still under the neighborhood ruse\nYou can take your boy out the hood but you can't take the hood out the homie\nTook his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey\nHollywood's nervous\nFuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service\n",
