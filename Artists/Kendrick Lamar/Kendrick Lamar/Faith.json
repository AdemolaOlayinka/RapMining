    "lyrics": "Cloud nine, Kendrick Lamar, uh\nI take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk\nI ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want\nBut if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance\nto witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man\nI found myself losing focus at a Sunday service\nEmbarrassed so I started questioning God, what is my purpose?\nHe say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me\nSpread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday\nI said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen\nI opened my bible and searched to be a better Christian\nand this from a person that never believed in religion\nBut shit, my life is so fucked up man, I can't help but give in\nI'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met\nHopped on the pulpit and told 'em how I was truly blessed\nFelt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over\nWalked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered\nand lost my faith again\n\nWhat am I gonna do? Gotta have faith\nLife is too much, understood? Where is your faith?\nOh, faaaaaaaith...\nAll you need is the size of a mustard seed\n\nSingle black parent from Compton raising children of four\nThat's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know\nHer day consists of working back and forth with babysitters\nCan't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister\nHer baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit\nSpent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit\nShe pray to God every night hoping that he'll mature\nand maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for\nBaby wanna go back to school but she need some help\nbecause it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself\nShe thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice\nthat said the Devil is a lie, make a better choice\nAnd so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing\nwith them crazy ass people at the county building\nLooked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way\nThen got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8\nThen lost her faith again\n\n\nKendrick, I appreciate the opportunity to vent my nigga\nThis about how faith works, yeah, murk it...\nI had dreams of holding a nine-milla to raise Killa\nAsk him why as my eyes fill up\nEach day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas\nIt's jungle when the niggas ensue\nThe rat's lurking, vulture's circling the serpents\nCats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it\nI flirted with the idea of caressing the steel\nto make karma come faster than she normally will\nIt's ill, to see my faith try and leave me\nIt's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy\nI'm tryna reach cloud nine, that's what my niggas bout\nBut it never rain in California 'less them pistols out\nUntil then, my feet planted on the ground\nShadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding\nAnd if I get no answer, just know I tried\nI should have never looked into his son's eyes\nRay Charles voice\n\n\nThis for my people that stressing whenever times is hard\nYour mind's slipping, wondering is there really a God?\nKnowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain\nBut whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains\nWe can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer\ncause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair\nAnd your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care\nat the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares\nSearching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong\nJust know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room\nI watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost\nand wonder why I ain't never caught that feeling before\nMaybe they know him better, or I don't know no better\nBut what I do know is that he's real and he lives forever\nSo the next time you feel like your world's about to end\nI hope you studied because he's testing your faith again\nI'd rather not live like there isn't a God\nthan die and find out there really is, think about it\n",
