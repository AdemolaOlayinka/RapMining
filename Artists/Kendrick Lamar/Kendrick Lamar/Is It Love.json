Oh-ohh\nNo more silence (no more silence)\nDon't kill this thing we got called love (don't shoot)\nJust searching for the perfect shot\n\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away\n\nI used to write rhymes all day and all night\nWhen y'all was playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines\nMy conscience only knew what's half-tight\nAt 3:14, it's time to get me a slice my nigga\nThis is a dog's fight my nigga\nThe soundtrack to life my nigga\nKendrick Lamar, his momma called him that\nHe watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks\nHe sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack\nHe pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs\nPunk fake, jump-shot, ball hit the back\nBall dreams of being point guard was off limits Jack\nThat's because these Compton streets was built not to win\nYou killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?\nPart of me though, I'm searching for answers (just searching for the perfect shot)\nThe good kid from the ugly city that's mad that he's had some\nWhere is the love?\n\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away (where is the love?)\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away\n\nGive me rings, give me chains mayne\nGive me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range\nGive me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes\nA mansion with marble floors and security codes\nThen give me some landa, or maybe I'll land a\nG5, clear port, say hello to the man\nGive me awards, Grammies, and let the crowd applaud\nmy name till they strain the veins in they vocal chords\nGive me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses\nWith that being said, give me Tiger's sports endorsements\nGive me billboards, whatever that people would kill for\nManhattan at 40/40, no forties but rose poured\nGive me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity\nGive me a city where Channel 7 newscasters' cameras be\nGive me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts (just searching for the perfect shot)\nAnd if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar\nThis is me, and that's love\n\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away\nWhen love comes calling, don't look back\nWhen love comes calling, don't look away\n\nNow everybody smoke to it\nfor this is, the celebration\n",
