Riding with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one

We make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils

Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation, live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?
