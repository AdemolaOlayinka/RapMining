(Who, me?)\nAnd cause such a reaction that the motha fucka's go (Ooh wee)\nIt's like a group of happy children\nYo, it's such a feelin'\nTo see all of my live nigga's carry on now\nOh see how I be gettin' so passionate\nI get a thrill even when I bust my gun off by accident\nThe God bless glory, success story\nWhiteboy Billy put a stash up in my armrest for me\nThe way I fucks it up, it's like a fuck-fest for me\nI get on last and demolish everything before me\nWe run shit and that's a fact now, you're whack now\nAnd ain't no fuckin' turnin' back now, so relentless\nI won't even let you niggas finish a fuckin' sentence\nCall for my people like a school attendance\nAnd then I strike with a fuckin' vengence\nFinger on my trigger\nFigure I'll blast every last one of you bitch niggas\n\nSo (Get out)\nBitch nigga just (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out of here)\nPolice'll try to close the club (Get out)\nYou really should (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out of here)\nBitch, if you ain't got your own dough (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out)\nYou really should (Get out of here)\nIf you frontin' like you really live (Get out)\nAnd you know you not (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out of here)\n\nThe one world alliance\nFlipmode the most reliant for the thorough guidance\nOn how to get most of this money like a secret science\nOnly the live nigga's allowed, there's nothin' you can do\nFrontin' with your crew while you talkin' to corny bitches too\nNevertheless, address the cheddar for the treasure chest\nAnd bless the spot before the thugs protest, one time\nI hope y'all know just what the motherfuck you dealin' with\nWith so much platinum for the street, you thought I was a silversmith\nWe phat now, so look at how we brought it back now\nAnd made it possible for street niggas to hold a stack now\nAnd become the wealthiest, healthiest\nAnd bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius\nHold on, banker's money better roll on, or sing a broke folk song\nMy nigga's so long he paid with a big brim hat, just like a lampshade\nAnd bounce, wildin' in the truck, the joints my nigga Ramp made\nWe be them new millennium prime time niggas\nWalk a fine line, niggas sippin fine wine niggas\nNow, if you cross the line and fuck around them blind niggas\nWith so much pressure it's like we did the illest crime, nigga\nWhat? You know I'm like a loco man, noble man\nTurned global man, rippin' bi-coastal like a postal man\nAnd when we come, you know we came to get it\nAnd what you need to do is bounce if you ain't fuckin' with it\n\nSo (Get out)\nBitch nigga just (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out of here)\nPolice'll try to close the club (Get out)\nYou really should (Get out)\nPlease just (Get out of here)\nBitch, if you ain't got your own dough (Get out)\nYou need to just (Get out)\nYou really should (Get out of here)\nAnd if you frontin' like you really live (Get out)\nAnd you know you not (Get out)\nYou really should (Get out of here)\n\nGet out, get out, get out of here\n",
