I think I love ya, I think I love ya not
I think I love ya, I think I love ya not (I love you)
I think I love ya
(I can't get away from that taste, baby c'mon)
Uhh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (so right, so wrong)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (I love you, I hate you, need it like her-on)
Yeah (OOH!)

Baby girl see you the one, right?
And I love the way you appreciate my son life
Revolve around me how the planets do the sun like
They compliment the god phenomenally just right
Hmm, in the beginning you was just a cutie
But I love the way your flesh and spirit manifest your beauty
Smile pretty, ass bigger than my whole jacuzzi
This my city, have a seat and let me show the movie
Hmm, but I don't like it when you try to fight
Goin through the love and hell for shit to turn right
Instead of turnin LEFT, that's when the pain stick
See I don't like it when yo' ass try to talk shit
That's when the shit's a problem, when you be actin moody
Gettin mad at little shit and hold out on the coochie
Ha, even when I see the wrong sign
Baby girl me love ya long time
Hahahaha

Baby I don't like you - I got a problem baby
Even though I love you - you got me goin crazy
Baby I don't like you - all up in my face baby
Even though I love you - I can't get away from that taste
Baby c'mon, so right, so wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I love you, I hate you, need it like her-on, OOH! (yeah, yeah, yeah, YEAH)

E'ry time you step up on the scene
I love the way you shine, I love the way you gleam
I love the way you THINK, I love the way you dream
I love the way you cook, I love the way you clean
(I love you) The way you rep for me it's hard to doubt ya
I scratch my head thinkin on what else I love about ya
So many different things, sometimes you drive me crazy
But what I love the MOST, is how you love my baby
(I hate you) Hmm, but then again when you be actin psycho
I don't like when you get jealous and be actin spiteful
Emotional and over-zealous got me feelin stifled
See I don't like the way you BLACK when you be on your cycle
Hmm, I think about when you be slackin up
And you get weak, see I don't like when you be actin up
Ha, even when I see the wrong sign
Fuck it, you know me love ya long time
Hahahaha


(I love you) That's why I got you on my side
(I hate you) That's when I put you out my ride
(I love you) That's why I rep you with the fullness
(You know that I hate you) Whenever you be on that bullshit
All my ladies all around the world
Hold your man down, show him how you rep to the finish
All my homies all around the world
Hold your girl down, show 'em how you rep when they with us


(I think I love ya) I love you
I can't get away from that taste
Baby c'mon, so right, so wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I love you, I hate you, need it like her-on, OOH! (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(I think I love ya) I love you
(I think I love ya not, I think I love ya)
I love you
