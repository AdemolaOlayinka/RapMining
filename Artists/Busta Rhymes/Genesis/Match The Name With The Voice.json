(Flipmode)\nGot you gaspin' for air, hot shit muthafuckas\nThrow your hands in the air\nWATCH HOW WE DO IT\nHow we rep and yo we solemnly swear\nTo put it down until it's over and our time is up here\nSO WHO ARE YOU?\n\n\nRampage, new tenant, pack big still\nFuck what ya heard, I'm ready to kill\n\n\nAND HOW YOU DOIN'?\n\n\nDay criminal, street thug material\nFlipmode Imperial, top breakin' officer\nFuck around we warnin' ya, 21 gun salute\n6 official conrads, ain't afraid to shoot\nNiggas see us, we got them shakin' in they boots\nFlipmode, the streets, bigger than Bayroots\n\n\nSO WHO ARE YOU?\n\n\nYeah, Spliff Starr, cunt-crusher, gun-busta\nHard-to-toucha, one bad muthafucka\n\n\nAND HOW YOU DOIN'?\n\n\nGangsta bitch, deadly like cancerous\nI bring it where your parents live, show you what your status is\nSteam-boil your cabbages, I can't take y'all nigaz faggotness\nYou about to die, show him where his casket is\nYou wanted beans, I had your hood under siege\nGuns get squeezed, and bullets hit your knees\n\n\nSO WHO ARE YOU?\nBus-A-Bus now, somethin' fo' sho'\nKeep 'em whilin' till somebody's left a leak on the flo'\nAND HOW YOU DOIN'?\nWe've been awaitin' the God, to make an undernovel entry\nControllin' everything in the yard\nRugged like General Custard it seems\nHow we crush grapefruit, niggaz, and make a mustard out of your team\nYou know we hotter than the 4th of July\nSo sit back and watch the fireworks show light up my name the sky\n",
