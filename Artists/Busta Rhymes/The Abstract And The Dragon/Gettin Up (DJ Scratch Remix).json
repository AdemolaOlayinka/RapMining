Vernon\nThe games coming back to the truth\nTables are turning, I'ma preach\nBitch lemme give you my Eric Sermon\nA lot of niggas is gettin shine they ain't deservin\nRingtone money goin out, they pockets is hurtin\nThey bitches leave em, see niggas like me and get to flirtin\nTake em to the telly poke em now listen how they be cursin\nTip you know this joint is the shit, nigga we workin\nWe back flooding the street, like we quenching they thirst and\nWe bodying the situation, we never let up\nGet out ya and get off ya ass, everybody get up\n\n\nCome over here baby, don't look so grumpy\nThis kinda lifestyle could be so comfy\nWe could start a clan just like the Kennedys\nYou and I again, certainly we could extend\nFeelings that should never end\nYou respect me like a friend\nBut love me like your man, no other could contend\nAnd we could be like those exposed to history\nLike staying with each other with truth or chivalry\nThe things we go through, they shape identity\nYes pretty, let's do this all night\nConsummate this thing and make it alright\nAnd when we cuddle up I promise that I'll bite\n\n\nI like to watch everybody gravitate towards you\nYour magnetic presence make them all come through\nThe same way you got them you got me too\nNow look at our lives so colorful\nA wonderful spectrum, not one tone dull\nFull of excitement and not one lull\nSee we had an understanding, oh yes we did\nI'm bringing it back, I'm puttin in my bid\nHave a couple of kids, have a couple of cribs\nWe like Ruby Dee and Ossie, Martin and Coretta\nDoin it to death, no one can do it better\nWhen we leave our physical our spirits still together\nSo come on now, here's a placement for your hand\nYou rockin with the number one MC man\nThe number one controller of right with the plan\n",
