    "lyrics": "with Q-TIP)\nI always wanted to rhyme on this shit\nYea... La La La La La La\nLa La... I always wanted to sing that shit\n\nYo, when I come with the excitement\nLike a baby when they speak they first words\nSo compelling when I speak can even burst nerves\nSkyscraper rhymes flying like the first bird\nPenthouse view I help ya see the earth curve\nI scorch the street and you can search for burns\nI think sick before I speak my thoughts hurt the words\nHere I come, I come to get you what you each deserve\nFeed the street the shit that make em want to eat the curb\nWell if you lookin for me, here I am, run\nBecause you can't erase me, accept it how it come\nYou might as well embrace me, somehow I'm never done\nMaybach Zeppelin, call em metallic plum\nAnd while im having fun, we gotta keep it bouncing\nUnraveling another bag of the money, keep counting\nWhen a cup runeth over like a broken water fountain\nHere I am like I appeared at the top of the mountain\nOr here I am back from vacation, see ya boy is home\nParading for the kid, they respect cus the cornerstone\nInvading strips so incredibly like im local homes\nConnect the hoods international like a global phone\nIt's so magical how I hold my own or with my brother Kamaal\nOr when I hold the chrome, merciless with my advesaries\nI'm so alone, i'm in a place into planetary i'm in a zone\nInsighting wires int spots see how I get em\nGot em wild see how I be smilin when i'm with em\nThen I remind em, see i'm right behind em when I hit em\nCus when I finally kill em got them bottles in ice buckets\nYou know we gotta chill em, touching us over the streets\nSee thats how got up in em, then im back to my city\nTo properly put em on and make an everlasting\nImpression, my people sing along now\n\n\nThere's a million MCs that claim they want some\nBut see I create sounds that make your ears go numb\nPeace to Sayres Ave., yeah you know how we go\nMy best friend Steven at the Home Depot\nLaurelton is in the house, I can't forget Southside\nWalk past MCs like that girl did to Pharcyde\nI'm labeled as the cat's meow, the MC with the know-how\nAct like you know, not now but right now\nBeast of the East, on MCs I have a feast\nI'd eat that ass like quiche, crack a smile like Shanice\nStraight outta Jamaica, seen? Jamaica, Queens\nBut you could find me out in Georgia, or anywhere in between\nNow if my partners don't look good, Malik won't look good\nIf Malik don't look good, then Quest won't look good\nIf the Quest don't look good, then Queens won't look good\nBut since the sounds are universal, New York won't look good\nPicture Phife losing a battle, come on, get off it\nPut down the microphone son, surrender, forfeit\nDid I hear something 'bout a crew? What they wanna do?\nYou better call Mr. Babyface so he can bring out the cool in you\nOr it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton\nAnd I'll dissect you like a fraction\nOh, you wannabe top cat MCs, I'll pop you like a zit\nYou wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit\nBig up myself every time when it comes to this\nMCs be running scared as if they're watching the Exorcist\nI kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead\nMy styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast-fed\nYou know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nI dedicate this to all the MCs outta Queens\nThat goes for Onyx, LL, Run DMC\nAkinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P\nYou need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other\nNuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover\nYo, Tip don't worry none you know I get the party jumping\nGet on the mic and break 'em off a little little something\nYo, Tip don't worry none you know I gets the party jumping\nGet on the mic my man and break 'em off a little something\n\n\nWe got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit\nSo recognize me, kids memorize me\nEveryday, I be scrounging, really I be lounging\nI play the down low, very very incognito\nAries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme\nSometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the honeys wiggle\nIntellect is the major, some heads like to wager\nThe skills on the hill, overlooking dollar bills\nMan, you're crazy, thinking you can phase me\nThe Ab doesn't study mere nonsense, money\nLife seems to need me, MCs seem too cheesy\nWith their doody ass renditions of defeating competition\nI rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man\nBet your bottom dollar Vinia will make you holler\nAs you stand at attention, did I forget to mention\nMCs will give me twenty if I sense that they act funny\nLyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant\nJust mentioning the fact that the area is fat\nI dwell in the under, so honey it's no wonder\nThat I get plenty of tail, well I even get white\nI'mma bet hitting head crack, there money, take that\nBreaking niggas off, cut their bank, then I'm off\nWhile my Nikes match my Lo hat, beat joint is mad fat\nGot the cutter of the box if a kid think he's ox\nFor tier means creator, the poetry relator\nIt's hemmed like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss\n\n\nQueens got a...\nBrooklyn got a...\nBronx got a...\nStaten Island got a...\nLong Island got the zone\nJersey got a...\nPhilly got a...\nMilwaukee got a...\nL.A. got a...\nOaktown got the zone\n",
