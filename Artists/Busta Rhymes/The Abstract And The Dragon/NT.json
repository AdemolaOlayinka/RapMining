Drink a NyQuil when I'm bed on your ass\nOh well then here comes the gelatin\nTips on some sugars but you yap on your cell to friends\nNow your party is completely blown\nReal name is Kamal I'm in \"complete me\" zone\nIt's rap time for you that means nap time\nReachin for my joint? What the fuck, I'mma clap mine\nSingin songs a sixpence with sit tensed\nSurpised your ass is the end like the sixth sense\nHeavy hitters knockin shit out the park\nYou didn't even really play tell me why did you start\nSpittin' sharp blades laced with bleach\nYou wanna play around kid I'm not a walk at the beach\nA stroll in the park or your fuckin playground\nPut on your headphones and tell me how grenades sound\nPut on your walkmase and go underneath the town\nQ-Tip abstract how I gets down\n\nAll my bitches, dance if you know that you damn sure\nLet your pussy drip on the dance floor if you wanna\n(Get down)\nFuck that niggas will bust gats\nBetter lit a make for their rush that cuz they wanna\n(Get down)\nFlip this piano sick shit\n(Get down)\nChill you can get off my dick and\n(Get down)\nWhile I'm on the hook get on your good foot\nAnd blow up the spot for all of you niggas cuz that's how we\n(Get down)\n\nComin with the brand new quickly we pan to\nThe young black man with intentions to ban you\nSeems that people need an aid today\nSo many fade away, so many fiend to stay\nI really rhyme cuz I feel I should say things\nWhile the fraudulent acts rap just so they cop rings\nOr maybe because when they was young\nThey was fronted on and left alone to have their own fun\nNow they're all grown up to be assholes\nI'm giving you the rope will you tie some lassos?\nYou swing dangling from peach trees\nWhile I sip my Daiquiris in the south west breeze\nWritings so exciting the pen it keeps\nDrippin out jings that's converted to hymns and them\nPeople be hummin em from now to their next of kin\nMy family is starving? You know they want me to win\nWe forfeit nigga please get off it\nSend the check in my name to my office\nMutombo in the lane yo I toss it\nAbstract comin through witness the bomb shit\n",
