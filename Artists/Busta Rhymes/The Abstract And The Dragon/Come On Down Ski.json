You don't respect my lyrics\nMy bars, or this verse? You want the Ra-Ra homie?\"\nSo i went back in their and I did the Ra-Ra\nI did it at the end of the verse\nThat's why when you hear the verse you\nDon't hear the dungeon dragon until the end of the verse\nYo Kane, good lookin for the opportunity big homie\nKamaal Faried, AKA Abstract, Salute\n",
