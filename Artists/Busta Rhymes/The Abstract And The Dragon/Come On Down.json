As I come down and get dumb\nYes roughneck, swingin along with the drum\nSwimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how\nI react, Busta Rhymes will attack\nAs you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain\nGotta make a mega migraine\nWhattup? To the Big Daddy and Tip\nMy trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip\nHey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude\nWack do ya on the stage gettin booed\nThis structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors\nOn a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader\nKeep my volume on extra boom!\nAll the vains in my neck symbolizes that I want room\nWord up, huh! Here I am, damn\nDragon slayer stackin layer after layer\nThis jam will be ran while the record flim flam\nWiggle your front pram, to the runnin man\nSam, Busta, Rhymes, comin on time\nL.O.N.S. did, rip a new design\nFlavor one, taste the unborn baby\nFlip before you move or catch a bad one baby\nChiggy change chump, the over sized puff\nBusta pump you and the love, and then I rump\nEmotional stare point, for the wild\nBusta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle\nUnload, catch you like smell later\nDig on your taste of the third flavor, rrrarrrRHHH\nRARRARRRRH! Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!\n",
