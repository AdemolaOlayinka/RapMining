Imagine how the club sound\nLook and see I'm ready to spark it\nSoon as I zoom on my target, muhfucker better roll out the carpet\nSee the way I comin through, and how I kick in the door\nWatch how I coffee grind like never before.. the way I wreck from the door\nSo I mack wit' em, passin em, when I'm speakin\nI'm preachin, all my niggaz out in EVERY HOOD!\nYou tryin to compete? You better be INCREDIBLY GOOD!\nNiggaz you want heat? I figured you would!\nThat's I waste no time to give it to you niggaz (this time)\nAnd give you all the jewels in (this rhyme), and then I put it down to you all!\nI can't get enough of it niggaz, I gotta ex-plore (many)\nAll of my options, I gotta get me plenty more...\n\n\n\n\nA lot of niggaz shit sound dated\nI'm like Shaq, franchise player just got traded\nto the number one team in the league\nSee I ain't on J Records, I'm on DRE Records, Aftermath BITCH!\nYou need to learn 'cause you ain't knowin the half, BITCH!\nAnd while I'm gone I'm puttin dough in the stash, BITCH!\nSo new and fresh I say it again\nSo what it do, don't test see I'ma blaze to the end\nI'm comin through, so confess you niggaz know who the kid\nI'm like a newborn nigga, that's securing a win\n(HOT!) So new and so current and they hate this\nThe streets'll classify in another level of greatness\nI'm here to fix up the game, I'm givin it a facelift\nNew and improved, watch the way I make the game shift!\nNow watch me swing it out the ballpark\nI come to shut it down, don't let the war start while I come to get the...\n",
