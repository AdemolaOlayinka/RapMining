If you want your man to get down and\n(Taste it, taste it, taste it)\nJust throw your hands in the air, fella's just make it do it too\n(Taste it, taste it, taste it)\nNow you can both do it\n\n\nShorty hit me all on the two-way\nTell me to meet her way in the back by the couches up inside the cheetah\nThen I step up in the club keep it moving wit' my hand on my heater\nStay alert and never moving the sleeper\nEven though this shit was way off the meter\nCouldn't believe her\nShorty buggin' and giving me head in back of the speaker\nNow check it, I love the way she step to it and how she's keepin' it basic\nAnd always be ready to taste it\n",
