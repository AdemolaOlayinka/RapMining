Wanna say some hard shit\nTo show you I'm a artist, but this song is retarded\nI can't think of nothin', but I gotta say somethin'\nAnd since this track is bumpin', these ratchet hoes gon' love it\nI be goin' crazy on these records every day\nI'm getting' to the money every ma'fuckin' way\nI let all these hoes come over but not one of them can stay\nAnd this shit gon' never change 'til I'm old and I'm gray\nSit your ass down... and don't say nothin'\nBetter get excited when you see the don bumpin'\nAnd to me it's like Christmas for these bitches they be blushin'\nIt's disgustin' how they love it but I ain't givin' 'em nothin'\nYeah...\n\nMore money, more problems\nSame shit, just a different day\nIt's the end of the world every day\nIt's called survival\nThis shit is catastrophic\nCatastrophe\nNo room for the weak\nThe weak can suck a dick, and bow down\nConglomerate\nWe the best\nYMCMB\nShaheem Reid\n",
