God damn!\nHoly mackerel, pulling suckers' cards out the satchel\nYou can sleep tonight, it's okay\nB Boys in the cut and we're here to stay\nVibration, sensation\nChatter up on the mic and it's an incantation\nRevelation, elation\nA little patience with the tribulations\nHeed my flow, I got more in store\nRhymes are not just for breakfast any more\nAlways on vacation, like Clark and Rusty\nDon't wanna make the beer fest, trust me\nYour wack style is beyond a pale\nHeel up, wheel up, to the one Judge Smails\nCome at me with rain, I'm coming back with hail\nMy broad sword will cut through your chain mail\nBack up, Mike\nWell, Adrock, one of the greatest of all time, no disrespect\nI gotta go for mine\nBig Mike D, number spitting lead paint\nBringing it back, begin da oh-ah-oh-ah\nA-D-R-O-C-K spells relief\nThere's holes in my story like Leon Spinks' teeth\nGood grief, the middle name's Keefe\nI keep a microphone in a little, weird sheath\nI'm like Oscar the Grouch\nTrashy, rockin' Derelicte, flashy\nI keep it raw y'all\nJust imagine the 42nd Street C train bathroom\nI sizzle on the mic like a battered fried fish\nPundits in the house say -- WHAT! -- that's rich!\nThis is the type of shit that's gonna scratch that itch\nNow I'm-a set it off from up inside this bitch\nI see you're looking at me and thinking 'What him do?'\nWell, I rap upon this mic, Mike D, Sweet Lou\nAlso known as Pretty Lou, a-k-a Pretty Mike\nI switch up my name pretty much how I like\nThis routine dates way back\nA lot of people may remember this routine\nBut it's evolved now\nYeah, from the summer before last\nWell, my name is Mike D, and I gotta new name, and that new name is LARRY!\nWell, my name is Adrock, and then I gotta new name, and my new name is HARRY!\nWell, my name is MCA, but I gotta new name, and that new name is GARY!\nWell, our DJ's name has stayed the same, 'cause his new name is BARRY!\n",
