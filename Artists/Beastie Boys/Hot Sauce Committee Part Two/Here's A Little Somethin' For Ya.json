Honest Mike D\nDon't really care if the press likes me\nI just speak my conscience, just speak my mind\nI don't trip or flip and then I start to find\n\nQueens up front - Brooklyn's in the back\nFlack from flack guns - riot squads smokin' crack\nThe odds are stacked, for those who lack\nI been a lucky motherfucker when it comes to that\n\nI slow roast, I'm steady tappin'\nOh yes, I guess I'm the toast of Manhattan\nIn Miami, I'm sleazy with John Salley\nShout to Andre Leon Talley\n\n\nThis shit is crazy\nThis shit is cra-zyyyy! (DING)\n\nDr Carlton Brasserie A.K.A. Joyce\nDr. Bombay is the ladies choice\nStep on stage with the smoke from dry ice\nEvery time we bring it twice as noice\n\nNow ease up bredren, take an excedrin\nOnly name check to rhyme is Tippi Hedren\nI'm lookin' fine, I'm gettin' much finer\nSteady lounging in my lazy boy recliner\n\nLosing it in traffic, amped up on coffee\nLike kids going wild after school for Mr. Softee\nLike a slice around the corner (Uh) it's sneaking up on ya\nWhen you're breathing down your neck (GASP) it's creeping up on ya\n",
