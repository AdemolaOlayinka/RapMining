Beastie Boys
To The 5 Boroughs
2004)
All you trekkies and tv addicts 
Don't mean to diss 
Don't mean to bring static 
All you klingons in the fucking house 
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud 
Blowin' doors off hinges 
I'll grab you with the pinchers 
And no i didn't retire 
I'll snatch you up 
With the needle nose pliers 

Like mutual of omaha 
Got the ill boat 
You've never seen before 
Gliding in the glades 
And like lorne greene 
You know i get paid 
Like caprese and with the basil 
Not goofy like darren or hazel 
I'm a mother fucking nick at night with 
Classics rerunning that you know all right 
Now remain calm no alarm 
Cause my farm ain't fat 
So what's up with that 
I've got friends and family that i respect 
When i think i'm too good 
They put me in check 
So believe when i say i'm no better than you 
Except when i rap 
So i guess it ain't true 
Like that y'all and you just don't stop 
Guaranteed to make your body rock 

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about 
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out 

Said, "doc what's the condition 
I'm a man that's on a mission" 
Said, "son, you'd better listen 
Stuck in your ass 
Is an electrician" 
Like a scientist 
Mmmm when i'm applying this 
Method of controlling my mind 
Like einstein and the rappin' duke combined 
Hey baby bubba now what the deal 
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal 
Some call it salugi 
Some hot potato 
I stole your mic and you won't see it later 
Cause i work magic like a magician 
I add up like a mathematician 
I'm a bank cashier 
Engineer 
I wear cotton but i don't wear sheer 

Shazam and abracadabra 
In the whip i'm gonna cruise past ya 
Yo money, don't chump yourself 
Put that shit back on the shelf 
Light rays blazin' 
You're out of phase 
And my crews amazin' 
We're working on the record yo 
So stay patient 

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out 

Now, i go by the name of the king adrock 
I don't wear a cup nor a jock 
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre 
Like miss piggy 
Who moi 
I am the one with the clientele. 
You say, "adrock, you rock so well" 
I've got class like pink champale 
Mca grab the mic before the mic goes stale 

Don't test me 
They can't arrest me 
I'll fake right cross-over and shoot lefty 
You look upset, yo calm down 
You look cable guy dunked off of your crown 
I flow like smoke out a chimney 
You never been me 
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip hop b 

Get your clothes right out the dryer 
Put armor all up on your tire 
Sport that fresh attire 
Tonight we goin' out set the town on fire 
Set the town ablaze 
Gonna stun and amaze 
Ready to throw a craze 
Make your granny shake her head 
And say, "those were the days" 

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out 
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about 
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out 
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
