Who the illest?\nYou know my name's Adam stop callin' me Phyllis\nYa hear some fuss, you're like what's the clamor?\nIt's just me naked on the cover of Glamour\nA phenomenon pandemonium\nThe club is blowing up like plutonium\nWhat's all the fanfare what's the to do\nWe're known to bring the hullabaloo\nOn stage or at the spa\nGuaranteed we bring the brouhaha\n\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n\nThere's a commotion that's goin' down\nI talk more shit then drown the clown\nI'm like that freak from Cirque de Soleil\nWith my leg behind my head and a rhyme to say\nTen nine eight seven six five four\nGet upon the mic and I'm a even the score\none two three, three to two one\ndon't carry a knife and I don't carry a gun\nYo we be making mountains out of Cool Whip\nPass me the mint for the julep\nTell me everybody where is the love\nHey yo what's the motherfuckin' hubbub\n\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n\nCommunicator check one two one two\nThis is Bones McCoy on a line to Sulu\nSet the bullshit to warp factor one\nCheck your tri-corder set your phaser to stun\nOh mai oui you can catch me\nAt Jean Vie with a pastry\nC'est ci c'est la oh n'est pas\nQu'est-ce-que c'est le brouhahaha\nHa haha haha!\nJust back from Japan and ooh I'm laggin'\nGoin' rao rao with the dungeon dragon\nYou can dance if you want to leave your friends behind\nBut if they don't dance and then they won't dance they can kiss my fuckin' ass\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n'Cause it's a brouhaha\n",
