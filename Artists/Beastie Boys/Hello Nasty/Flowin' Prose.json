    "lyrics": "I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros\nI'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know\nBut beyond the concepts and emotions that rise\nTo the interconnectedness that underlies\nThe lies upon lies have lost their meaning\nThe plies upon plies of consciousness that is being\nOver and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl\nIt's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all\n\nNow every word that you heard that I said that you felt\nWas put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt\nI steal feels from reels but I pay my respects\nPaying compliments and disses and deciphering affects\nWords are water as I court her, as she is pristine\nWords and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings\nI give in and I win I try to never complain\nIntentions venture to center and then they set the stage\nBut I'll remain sane making gain without pain\nStaining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain\nAnd keep it positive as painstaking as it is\nI'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live\n\nSo like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme\nComing like thunder with lightening timing\nNo hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans\nFerment time like wine no ploys or scams\nLike the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas\nIdeas coming to me in answer to my pleas\nWoke up this morning right out of a dream\nReached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme\nWhat can I do with these bones and flesh?\nWith these animated thoughts in a world repressed?\nI'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change\nI'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range\nI'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros\nI'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose\nI'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King\nHis Holiness and all enlightened beings\nI'll be the one who screams it on the microphone\nI'll be the one who brings it inside your home\nBut the words ain't mine I just pass em along\nFor Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song\nAnd more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes\nAnd more crimes are committed as I say these lines\n",
