The Sumo Wrestler\nGot The Beats In Manhatten You Can Hear In Westchester\nWell, My Mother Was Born Out In Coney Island\nRaised On The L.E.S. Manhatten Island\nMy Dad Camo Out From Detroit And They Had Me\nAnd Back On Through Ellis Island Goes Through The Family Tree\nWell, I'm A Six Point Seven On The Richter Scale\nI've Got Rhymes Gallot And Then I Never Fail\nLike Gravy To Potatos, Luke To Darth Vader\nI'm A Souped Up Sucker And I'll See You All Later\n\n\n\nYou See Me Coming Down The Block With The Funky cuts\nYou Say Mike D. And I Say Mic These Nuts\nI've Got Attractions Like I'm Elvis Costello\nAdam Yauch Grab The Mic 'Cause You Know You're My Mellow\nWell When I Get It Into The Zone\nI'm Gonna Take It To A Place Where It's All One\nMy Shit Is On And The Rhyme Style's Kicking\nMy Brain Is Flowing Honest Like Abe Lincoln\n'Cause I'm The Fuckin' Rythm Ace With The Rhyme Selection\nListen All Y'all I Rap With Perfection\nBecause I Got The Mother Fuckin' Old School Flavor\nThat You Savor So Watch Your Behavior\nTalking Other Dimensions, Levels Higher\nWhy Did Billy Joel Say We Didn't Start The Fire\nTake You To Another Realm, Another Level\nI've Got The Funky Rhymes But I'm Not The Funky Devil\nI Step From Minute To Minute, Lifetime To Lifetime\nStep From Stage To Stage To See It All Unwind\nSlowly But Surely I Seek To Find My Mind\nAnd Every Wall That I Face Is Of My Own Desig\nGlendale Boulevard Boulevard\nGlendale Boulevard Is Where I'm At\nIt's Where I'm At, Where I Live\nCheck It Out Because My Head Is Like A Siv\nAnd We Turn It Out\n",
