Beastie Boys
Ill Communication
1994)
You're coming off like you're Van Damme
You've got Kenny G, in your Trans Am
You've got names like Billy Ray
Now you sing Hip Hop Hooray
Put your Dakleys and your stone wash on
Watching MTV and you mosh on
#1 on the side and don't touch the back
#6 on the top and don't cut it wack, Jack
Shiny chrome rims never rusted
Driving through the tunnel, you might get busted
Never trusted, Mullet head
You know you took that girl to bed
Cruising 8th Street Saturday night
Trying to find a head shop, looking to fight
You've got that stonewash derriere
Spike the top because the week-end is here
You wanna know what's a mullet? well
I got a little story to tell
About a hair style, that's way of life
Have you ever seen a Mullet wife?
Yo, take a chill B, check out my Spillbee
'Cause you don't know about the Mullet head
Cruise in my Iroc, stonewash on my cock
Got it like that 'cause I'm the Mullet head
Put me on trial 'cause I'm worth your while
Pass me the comb 'cause I'm the Mullet man
Read the New York Post, read a story
About Joey Buttafooco in all his glory
They said he tried to freak it with a high school girl
Pimpin' Amy Fisher to the rest of the world
A real lover man, a real Cassanova
Joey got horny and now he's over
Amy got pissed, shot his wife
Joey guest to jail for the rest of his life
Cut the sides, don't touch the back
