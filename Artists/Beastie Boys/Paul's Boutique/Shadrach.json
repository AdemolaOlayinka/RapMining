Truman\nI'm madder than Mad's Alfred E. Newman\nNever gonna let them say that I don't love you\n\nMy noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts\nAdam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course\nSmoke the holy chalice got my own religion\nRally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians\nJerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell\nYou love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well\nVicious circle of reality since the day you were born\nAnd we love the hot butter on what the popcorn\nSippin on wine and mackin\nRockin on the stage with all the hands clappin\nRide the wave of fate it don't ride me\nBeing very proud to be an M.C.\nAnd the man upstairs I hope that he cares\nIf I had a penny for my thoughts I'd be a millionaire\nAmps and crossovers under my rear hood\nThe bass is bumpin from the back of my Fleetwood\nThey tell us what to do hell no\nSHADRACH MESACH ABEDNAGO\n",
