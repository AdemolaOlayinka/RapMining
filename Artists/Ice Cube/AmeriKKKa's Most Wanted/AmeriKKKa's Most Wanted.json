Saw my face on TV\nDamn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out\nStruck out, I gotta get the fuck out\nPack my bags and tried to hit the dough when\nthe ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in\nCos the feds was out there ten deep\nI got hassled and gaffled in the back seat\nI think back when I was robbin my own kind\nThe police didn't pay it no mind\nBut when I start robbin the white folks\nNow I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope\nI said it before and I'll still taught it\nEvery motherfucker with a colour is most wanted\n",
