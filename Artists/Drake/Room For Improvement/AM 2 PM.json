Give 'em a quick shot\nNow I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch\nYeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock\nIt's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering\nAnd tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT\nThey don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked\nSaran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh\nI'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh\n\nIt ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit\nYou cut us a check, then we go through some hits\nThen you show us respect, then we'll say you legit\nAnd this is the life that I lead from AM to PM\nI'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows\nSoon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos\nThe concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old\nAnd this is the life that I lead from AM to PM\n\nAyo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in\nDJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving\nFrom the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins\nGot me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in\nWell guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'\nAnd all the bottles wrapped in cellophane\nHundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win\nVirgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me\nTo the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll\nOrangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal\nI ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map\nLight that fire, realize they ain't born to rap\nPass the torch and sell they soul\nMaybe they can bring they career back\nBut these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that\nCause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's\nCigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive\nAll my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check\nMy cousins, they paint they to get respect\nThis can't be life, dominoes and dro and twenty stacks\n\nRest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!\nYou think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny\nPull the jack rabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!\n\nIt ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit\nYou cut us a check, then we go through some hits\nThen you show us respect, then we'll say you legit\nAnd this is the life that I lead from AM to PM\nI'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows\nSoon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos\nThe concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old\nAnd this is the life that I lead from AM to PM\n",
