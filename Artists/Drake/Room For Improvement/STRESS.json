It's Drake man.Yeah\nAyo Ren this that gritty shit here man\nI'ma half to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean\nHO! Southern Smoke!!!\n\nVery few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics\nOr can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doing\nThe samples that they using, can't get through the clearing\nI'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it\nMy father's early careering forced my parents to split up\nMy mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up\nWith just being a florist, the choir sang his chorus\nAnd he got back into doing what he was doing before us\nBecause money is an issue, your son he gon miss you\nAnd plus you got a wife at home because mommy still exist too\nNow you looking for exes, you ain't never expect this\nYou end up doing time, and me I end up with a step-sis\nNobody passing judgment, or question where the drugs went\nYou know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't\nAnd mommy I'ma support her, I keep it all in order\nSee her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border\nBut\n\nI got stress on my shoulders\nTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder\nYoung black man dodge your bullets trying to get older\nAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers\nIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz\nMake a little money, find a bunny\nto make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz\nMake a little money, find a bunny\nto make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!\n\nThis is my life, and so the rest is kinda been cool, question what I been through\nI write a verse addressing it, and yes I might offend you\nPicture when I was in school,\nMe being the closest thing to black, and guess what rap music what I was into\nRest of the kids were sheltered, I never liked to fight\nBut when someone called me a \"nigger\" I'd punch them I couldn't help it\nNow I'm grown I can say what it is\nIt's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raising they kids\nAnd your daddy want it very right\nI make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve, I think he want you to marry white\nHe want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White\nBecause black is black honey, even if he's very light\nAnd so I never been for dinner at they places\nAlways brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces\nI live it so the case is, whether Drake is\nWay ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist\n\nI got stress on my shoulders\nTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder\nYoung black man dodge your bullets trying to get older\nAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers\nIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz\nMake a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz\nMake a little money, find a bunny to make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!\n\nAm I hot as the rest, should I strive for my spot as the best\nLike girls with Double D's, I gotta lot on my chest\nThere's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test\nInstead of staring at quizzes (?) now it's models with breasts\nAnd yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen\nI sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician\nHomie, I probably could of been on TV consistent\nAn artist like Pablo, or maybe Petey's assistant\nAnd my mindset is come and get me\nI'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody running with me\nSo, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady, daughter, and her grandson\nNigga get the handgun\nIf not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond\nThat have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen\nLast couple of months I done probably been\nAround the world and back, and I don't wanna question half the places Nick been\n\nI got stress on my shoulders (Uh!)\nTrying to keep my heart pure but this world is making it colder (Yeah!)\nYoung black man dodge your bullets trying to get older (Oh!)\nAnd you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers (Yeah man!)\nIT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz\nMake a little money, find a bunny\nto make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (This that gritty shit boy)\nI'm just trying to live my life cuz (Got me winded over here man)\nMake a little money, find a bunny\nto make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO! (Uh)\n",
