Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nIf I need to talk are you around?\nAre you down for the cause?\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\nAre you down? Are you down? Are you down?\nAre you down for the cause?\nYou still down? You still down? You still down?\n\n\nThese days these new girls got me nervous\nThey go to school and do bottle service\nThey can't decide, they keep switching majors\nBeing indecisive makes me anxious\nCall your number and it's out of service\nWho can I call for your information?\nWhat am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?\nWho is your replacement?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\nAre we still good? Are we still good?\n",
