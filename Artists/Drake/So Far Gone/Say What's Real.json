    "lyrics": "Why do I feel so alone\nLike everybody passing through the studio is in character\nAs if he acting out a movie role\nTalking bullshit as if it was for you to know\nAnd I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go\nSo they stick around, kicking out feedback\nAnd I entertain it is if I need that\nI had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that\nMy privacy about the only thing I need back\nBut, It's hard thinkin in polite flows/\nWhen Stephano Polato suits are your night clothes\nAnd Jordan sweat suits are you flight clothes\nAnd you still make it even when they say your flight close\nEyes hurting from the camera phone light shows\nLife was so full, now the shit just been lypo'd\nAlways said I'll say it all on the right track\nBut in this game you only lose when you fight back\nBlack diamond bracelets, showing you the basics\nI can't live and hold the camera someone got to tape this\nI make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss\n24 hours from greatness, I'm that close\nDon't ever forget the moment you began to doubt\nTransitioning from fitting in to standing out\nLos Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South\nWatch Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out\nAnd my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out\nSo I park about 5 houses down\nShe say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown\nBut I don't want to feel the need to wear disguises around\nSo she wonders where my mind is, account's in the minus\nAnd yet I role around the fucking city like ya highness\nGot niggaz reacting without a sinus\nCause what I'm working with is timeless\nAnd promoters trying to get me out to they club\nAnd say I have fun, but I can't imagine how\nCause I just see my ex girl, standing with my next girl, standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now\nAnd shit can get weird, unless they all down\nAnd so I stay clear, we from a small town\nAnd everybody talks, and everybody listen\nAnd somehow the truth just always comes up missing\nI've always been something that these labels can't buy\nEspecially if they trying to take a piece of my soul\nAnd Silvia be telling Taz damn Drake fly\nAnd he just be like silly motherfucker I know\nThat was your bad, how can you pass up on 'em\nHe just take them records and he gas up on 'em\nWayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em\nSurprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em\nOh they did Po, at least they tried to\nAnd that's what happen when you spitting what inside you\nBut slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video\nAnd they think they can market you however they decide to\nNah, before they told me to 'do me'\nAnd don't listen to anybody that knew me\nCause to have known me, would mean that there's a new me\nAnd if you think I changed in the slightest could have fooled me\nBoy, and to my city I'm the Two Three\nDrug dealers live, vicariously through me\nI quit school and it's not because I'm lazy\nI'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy\nUnderstand, I could get money with my eyes closed\nLost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo\nSo If you find a blackberry with the side scroll\nSell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know\nCause they need it much more than I ever will\nI got new shit, I'm getting better still\nLittle niggaz put my name in they verses\nCause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal\nFuture said cause it's Ye shit you better kill\nAnd I think this got that making of a legend feel\nProblem with these other niggaz they ain't never real\nYea, it's all I can say\n",
