    "lyrics": "Yeah Look\nIt's what you all been waiting for ain't it?\nYour weekly entertainment\nFor me to get a hold of this beat\nAnd go ahead claim it\nI'm about to paint a picture\nYou niggas go 'head frame it\n'cause we getting Seinfeld\nOn some Jerry and Elaine shit\nI flow far from mediocre\nAnd if we talking cards\nI will fold 'em with the poker\nYou and your whole crew are like a deck of 54\nSo it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rollin' wit' some jokers (unh)\nAnd me I'm rolling with some brokers\nLike damn, could you niggas get any broker\nGot my new girl so content\nJust save yourself the embarrassment\nDon't even approach her\nDisguise yourself, go buy a costume\nI am making stocks work while you working stock room (unh)\nAnd I was praying I would drop June but label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes\nSo I keep it rockin' for Pete's sake\nYou fake gangsta rappers are clich\u00e9\nAnd if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake\nI be in your face like \"No speaka la englis\"\nSoon as you hear it, you quote it\nThey tryna be the one that I done left out the show with\nBut trust me I'm aware and my car's right there\nIs this interior enough for your ulterior motives\n'Cause if you like it you should stick with me\nMy money good I ain't ever had to flip a key\nA lot of ice a lot of cream like Dicky D\nMight cut the phone and disappear like Mishy me\nBut I'm tryna have you on that trip with me\nSliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery\nAnd your ex-man is a hater, officially\nProbably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he'd be\nYeah, that's the reason why he looking hard\n'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out his cookie jar\nHe just mad 'cause his girl at the house with her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card\nLet me address this, pardon me while I fix\nCouple subliminal lines caught me in the mix\nI guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks\nBut at this point I'm just poking her body with a stick\nNowadays rapping is a children's hobby\nAnd girl's keep telling me I'm still as snobby\nI tell 'em myself who I am feeling probably\nJust because I got a buzz like a building lobby\nIt ain't a song that your ass finna skip\nI tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip\nThe way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car\nSeems like she don't really need no gas for the trip\nMillionaire shades, fade with waves, I smirk at a nigga if he still rockin' braids,\nThat just lets me know that we ain't on the same page and that goes out to every nigga except Trey\nAy, I'm outta here baby\nThey asked me about the past years and how does it phase me\nI wouldn't take it back, nah, not if you paid me\nMister bet you that's expensive cause it's not a Fugayze\nSpittin' that crock pot of bottomless gravy\nThe shit is so nasty, how is it tasting\nAnd you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's\nForget a girl, they just thinking how to replace me\nExit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope\nHe took that\n'Ye beat and you put that shit in a choke,\nwell, I think that I should leave out on this note nigga keep your two cents,\nI ain't tryna leave you broke\nLife of a Don, lights keep glowing,\ncoming in the club with that fresh shit on with something crazy in my arm, (arm),\nand here's another hit, Barry Bonds'\n",
