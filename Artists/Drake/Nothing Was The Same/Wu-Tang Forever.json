Agrhh!\n\nI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten\nWe used to be friends, girl, and even back then\nYou would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that\nWell, made me think about the game, girl\nAnd how I switched it up with a new thang\nYoung nigga came through on his Wu-Tang\nAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure\n\nHow you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?\nIf you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fucking out of spite\nCause your man don't do you right, do you right\nI could fuck you so good then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like\nBaby who you like\n\nMachine gun raps for all my niggas in the back\nStadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map\nI just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first\nIt's about who did it right, niggas looking like \"Preach\"\nOpen cases on me for a half a million each\nI find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets\nI know, luckily I didn't have to grow there\nI would only go there cause there's niggas that I know there\nI don't know what's getting into me\nI just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club\nAnd you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy\nYou ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be\nPeople like Mazin who was a best friend to me\nStart to become a distant memory\nThings change in that life and this life started lacking synergy\nAnd fucking with me mentally, I think it's meant to be\nParanoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys\nBut you gotta understand when it's yours\nThey don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice\n\nI just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten\nWe used to be friends, girl, and even back then\nYou would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody in that\nWell, made me think about the game, girl\nAnd how I switched it up with a new thang\nYoung nigga came through on his Wu-Tang\nAnd nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nNobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours\nIt's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure\n",
