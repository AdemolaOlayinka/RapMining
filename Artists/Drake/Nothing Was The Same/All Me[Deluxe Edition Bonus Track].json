She want all the fame\nI hear that shit all the time\nShe said she love me\nI said, \"Baby girl, fall in line.\" OK\nMade a million, off a dinner\nFork, watch me switch it up\nWalked in, \"Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!\" (Damn!)\nYou need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo\nJust bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note\nFrom the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off\nAnd my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off\nThis that sauce, this that dressing\nGivenchy, nigga God bless you\nIf having a bad bitch was a crime\nI'd be arrested (True)\n\n\nI touched down in '86\nKnew I was a man by the age of 6\nI even fucked the girl that used to babysit\nBut that was years later on some crazy shit\nI heard your new shit, nigga hated it\nDamon Wayans homie don't play that shit\nI get paid a lot, you get paid a bit\nAnd my latest shit is like a greatest hits\nGod damn\nAin't no wishing over on this side\nY'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side\nGod damn\nShould I listen to everybody or myself?\nCause myself just told myself, \"You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help.\"\nCashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,\nYa'll keep talking 'bout who next,\nBut I'm about as big as it gets\nI swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,\nI'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,\nI'm a make it last forever,\nIt's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,\nLook, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,\nI was made for all of this shit,\nAnd I'm on the road box office sales,\nI'm getting paid for all of this shit,\nAsk you to please excuse my table manners,\nI was making room for the table dancers,\n'Cause if we judging off your advances,\nI just got paid like eight advances, God damn!\n\n\nHOE, SHUT THE fuck UP\nI got way too much on my mental\nI learn from what I've been through\nI'm finna do what I didn't do\nAnd still waking up like the rest do\nNot complicated, it's simple\nI got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full\nAnd to them hoes I'm everything\nEverything but gentle\nBut I still take my time\nMan I guess I'm just old fashioned\nWearing retro shit, that's old fashioned\nNigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption\nI paint pics, see the shit\nGood sex, need to hit\nKeep a bra on the floor\nYear round like season tickets\nI plead the fifth\nDrink a fifth\nLoad the nine\nLeave you split, in the half\nSmoke a half, Need a zip\nMy new girl is on Glee and shit\nProbably making more money than me and shit\nI swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one\nI got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one\nLike I got trust issues\nI'm sorry for the people I've pushed out\nI'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom\nAnd still gotta pull out\nBut that's just me\nAnd I ain't perfect\nI ain't a saint but I am worth it\nIf it's one thing, I am worth it\nNiggas still hating but it ain't workin'\nLil' bitch\n\nOh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305\n'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,\nSmoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized\nGirl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that\nThey don't really fuck with you like that, they ain't never did me like that\nI just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that\nI been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back\nAnd I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)\nI'm blessed than a motherfucker,\nNiggas been stressed than a motherfucker\nNiggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,\nDamn that's a motherfucker\nTell the truth, I don't listen to ya,\n'Cause I don't like being lied to\nAnd that ship won't sail,\nAnd that wind won't guide you\nDaddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,\nLike a motherfucking drive-through\nThat was back then man,\nNow my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do.\n",
