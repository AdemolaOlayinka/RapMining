    "lyrics": "Yesterday when we were gettin high\nYou were invited, you would've liked it\nUh-uh-I-I know you all too well\nI said that we can kiss the past goodbye\nBut you weren't excited, there's no way to fight it\nYou could stay but shorty here I go\n\n\nTermanology... uh\nThey call me one thing, but they treat me like another\nI'm cheatin but do I love her, well more than any other\nSo it's personal, to paint you this type of picture\nWhen your wife is like your sister, seems you barely ever miss her\nBut another dude kiss her, you lose it, you wanna diss her\nWanna hit her, like you hope no one do to your sister\nGo figure, I ain't got a missus\nThey say it's none of yo' biz when them boys call their miss\nAnd the hall's shatterin, cause life is like a battlefield\nAnd y'all battlin cause, you got you a rapper deal\nSo I guess you start feelin how those rappers feel\nRaw dog, hope she go and get that mornin after pill\nBut if she get knocked up you gon' have to peel\nOr your career gonna be pushin up daffodils\nTake care of yo' kid, go check your mistress\nHit the lab and record, go handle your business\nWhat type of life is this? So many different choices\nToo many different opinions, too many different voices\nWhat am I afriad of, just to say love?\nI love you baby but, this is what I'm made of\nAnd I'ma be me, cause I can't be no other\nSo I don't know if Aaliyah's gettin a little brother\nBut all I know is I already got one baby mother\nAnd that's too much trouble, sorry I can't love you\n\n\nWhat am I afraid of?\nThis is supposed to be what dreams are made of\nBut people I don't have the time to hang with\nAlways look at me and say the same shit\nThey say - you promised me you would never change\nOhh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh\nYou promised me you would never change\nOhh, oh oh, ohh, oh oh, ohh (ohhhhh)\n\n\nUhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on\nWhen 40 got some shit for me to snap on\nNow that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on\nI'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on\nI heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home\nAnd I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone\nBut hit redial, you'll see that I just called\nSome chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all\nAnd, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected\nTextin sayin she wish she woulda kept it\nThe one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it\nMan I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's\nLike I'm high right now, the guy right now\nAnd you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now\nThat nothin really comes as a surprise right now\nCause we just havin the time of our lives right now\n\n\n\n\nWell alright, uhh\nI live by some advices girl, Lisa told me\nThe other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me\nUh, which made me question when I went missin\nAnd when I start treatin my friends different\nMaybe it was the fast-paced switch-up\nOr the two guns in my face durin the stick-up\nMaybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up\nOr the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up\nI know, but same time I'm quick to forget\nI'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets\nBurn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh\nCause half the time I got it right I probably guessed\nDid I just trade free time for camera time?\nWill I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?\nYeah.. I just need some closure\nAin't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over\n",
