(for you.. for you..)\nFresh (fresh.. fresh..)\n\n\nFor all you sucker MC's perpetratin a FRAUD\nYour rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold lost\nYou're the kind of guy that girl ignored\nI'm drivin Caddy, you fixin a FORD\nMy name is Joseph Simmons but my middle name's Lord\nand when I'm rockin on the mic, you should all applaud\nBecause we're (wheelin, dealin, we got a funny feelin)\nWe rock from the floor up to the ceilin\nWe groove it (you move it) it has been proven\nWe calmed the seven seas because our music is SOOTHIN\nWe create it (relate it) and often demonstrate it\nWe'll diss a sucker MC make the other suckers hate it\nWe're rising (suprising) and often hypnotizing\nWe always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in\nNo curls (no braids) peasy-head and still get paid\nJam Master cut the record up and down and cross-fade\n\n\nBecause the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail\nWitty as can be and not for sale\nAlways funky fresh, could NEVER be stale\n\nTook a test to become an MC and didn't fail\nI couldn't wait to demonstrate\nall the super def rhymes that I create\nI'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard\nAnd anything else is quite absurd\nI'm the master of a mic, that's what I say\nAnd if I didn't say that, you'd say it anyway\n\nBust into the party, come in the place\nSee the first things come, the music in your face\nTears down the walls, some of the floor\nwith the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore\n\nSo listen to this because it can't be missed\nand you can't leave til you're dismissed\nYou can do anything that you want to\nbut you can't leave until we're through\nSo relax your BODY and your mind\nand listen to us say this rhyme - HEY\nYou might think that you have WAITED\nlong enough til the rhyme was STATED\nBut if it were a test it would be GRADED\nwith a grade that's not DEBATED\nNothing too deep and nothing dense\nand all our rhymes make a lot of SENSE\n\nSo move your butt, to the cut\nRun amuk, you're not in a rut\nEach and everybody out there, we got the notion\n\nWe want to see y'all all in motion\n\nJust SHAKE, WIGGLE jump up and down\nMove your body to the funky sound\n\nSide to side, back and forth\n\nWe're the two MC's, and we're gonna go off\nStand in place, walk or RUN\nTap your feet, you'll be on the one\n\nJust snap your fingers and clap your hands\n\nOur DJ's better than all these bands\nHUH!!\n\nWe got all the lines\nand all the rhymes\nWe don't drop dimes\nand we don't do crimes\nWe bake a little cake with Duncan Hines\nand never wear the vest they call the Calvin Kleins\nCause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine\nDon't want nobody's name on my behind\nLee on my legs, sneakers on my feet\nD by my side and Jay with the beat\n\nJay Jay Jay Jay Jay Jay..\nWe don't.. we don't.. we don't stop!\nDon't.. don't.. don't.. don't stop! (JAY!)\nOne.. two.. three..\nHollis Crew.. crew.. crew..\nFor.. for.. for.. for the love now..\nCool T now..\nHah, ?? ..\nMy, my man Jam Master..\nis in his place to be.. (JAY! Jay.. Jay..
