I'm grande gato pa-po\nRun and Bo, D.M.C. and Fat Joe\nFo' cats on the same track got dough\nUs cuatro, lock flow, you don't know?\nFrom New York City to Puerto Rico (whoa)\n\n\nAy papi, tu sabe, yo tengo (??)\nYou got my fire burnin..\nAy papi, tu sabe, yo tengo (??)\nYou got my fire burnin..\n\n\nUhh, uhh\nWhat's goin on black? Goin platinum and beyond that\nLayin down the format, sippin on that Cognac\nWhere the Don at?\nI'm at Hollis with the kings payin homage to the things\nthey accomplished in they teens and I never stop throwin them flings\nControl of the game, I'm right here over the rain\nA human pot of gold, I already had a lot of flow\nReady to rock steady with Run and make a lot of dough\n\n\nYou might tell from the way I talk\nthat sucker MC's is who I stalk\nCreate in a rhyme that is in formation\nOr why I made such a rap creation\nThat is bound, to be reknowned\nwithin this city as a funky sound\nAnd to those that try to put me down\nMy DJ has jams, by the pound (c'mon, let's go)\n\n\n\n\nSkaggs Nit'\nAiyyo I rolled up, in the spot that I rolled up\nMy ice glitter like hold up\nAll the chickens like, \"Look at Bo, he done growed up\nThinks he the bomb, bet his beeper stay blowed up\"\nSo much frost on my wrist look my fist froze up\nA photographer is tryin to get a little close up\nWhy cause I'm a star now? Buy out the bar now?\nOr I press one button, start up my car now?\nI heard that you wanna spar now, so baby it's on\nI spit flows, rip shows 'til the day that I'm gone\nAnd this day I hit 'em off I'll have America sewn\nRich plat', rims chrome, spin (?) to your dome\nI entered your home, lick you down, strictly to bone\nThe hit that I'm on got Spanish mamis singin my song\n",
