Cool chief rocker, don't drink further 
Used to keep chiffon inside my locker 
Used to get toed down, now I slow down 
Hold the flow down from mo town to yo town

But if it's luck, then I'm the luckiest you know

Rhymes so def, rhymes rhymes galore 
Rhymes that you've never even heard before 
Say you've heard my rhymes, we're gonna have to fight 
Cause I just made the hot shut up last night 
That's right I'm rhyming tight to catch on the block 
Took it to new heights look at Kid Rock y'all 
I eat the rock crock, to put y'all on 
To have a Limp Bizkit in a piece of corn

Devastated mic controller 
The word wizard and the chief rock puller 
Bad beat boy made for the beat girls 
Rock through the rhymes as the turntable swirls 
Supreme people who was born to talk 
And over any recorded rap king we'll mix all 
These are the kings from around the way: 
Run, DMC, and Jam Master Jay

And this be going on and on 
Since the days of rock n' roll
