Crown Royal
2001)
For they, is the kingdome and the power, and the glory 
Forever...

The King's a ruler, the ruler rules 

 
I'm the epitome of royalty, you versus me, it's a joke 
I'm a rage, amazing blaze, you cigarette smoke  
Your video's number one and that was part of my plan 
Went from Rock Box to a whole countdown jam 
Took rock music, switched and flipped and made it raw 
Anyway you've played it, we've played it before in '84 
Every show, a hundred thousand people or more 
Famous still give us tours, and we be tryin' not to take em' all 
I bake em' all quicker than Sara Lee, come battle me 
Imagine that, what a sight that'll be 
Front page of the times, I can read the headlines now 
Rev Run beat clown down, when tryin' to take his crown

The King's a ruler, the ruler rules 

I'm the reason you started rhyming 
I'm the reason rap sales started climbing 
That's why I'm still headlining 
I'm the King and before I leave your ass gonna learn 
Yeah, y'all each wanna burn, wait your turn 
Run, I'm a living legend, my suggestion is learn your lesson 
I'll leave you stressing, confessing and begging for a blessing 
And whatever your impression..it better be, 
that we the top pedigree bringing y'all energy since '83 
I run this here since way back when 
I picked up a pair of adidas, and make y'all wear em' again 
If you thought it, I done did it, heard it, I done spit it 
New cats wanna pay their respect, son I'm with it 
But if not, I'm a reclaim the top of the charts  
Doin' shows with dough flows frip 'em apart 
Other than that, I'll just be holding my own 
Crown royalty up on a throne, for real

The King's a ruler, the ruler rules 

 
Our father, who art in heaven 
hollowed be thy name, thy kingdome come  
Thy will be done 
Forever...
