Let's stay together 
Yo, yeah, DMC my man 
In the place to be 
Yo, this song is dedicated to (word) 
(Whether good days, happy or sad) 
To all of those that's been down with each other since day one 
Aha, let's keep it together

 
Now we've been all around the world 
From the corner of the block to the top of the world and back 
We're the royalty on the Ave, ain't nobody ever have 
And the brand new jet black Cadillac 
We've been down since day one 
And no matter where I go people want to see him next to me 
They say "What's up with D?" I used to jam all across the land 
The coliseum, even MSG, when Raising Hell were cassettes 
In the shelves, and the plush hotel after every show 
We were just kissing the mic, living the life 
Of MTV and the radio 
And so you Jay and me said "it's 83'" 
We're living and sticking together like a family 
And no matter what, the rule must be 
That it's guaranteed that I'm for you, and you for me 
So:


Let's stay together let's stay together 
Loving you whether, love is good and bad 
And happy or sad

Yo, my love of the mic, can't touch my love for my wife 
Baby I ain't going nowhere, specially the way you smile 
When you have my child, or when I rock the crowd 
Can't wait to be right there 
Even my kids that ain't yours is still yours 
Cause you love him and treat him like your very own 
We be holding hands and I be holding doors 
And when my mother in-law spend time alone 
Call her about five hundred times a day 
When I'm often gone cause I'm on the road 
And when I'm on the phone, you know I want to be home 
Cause that's the one and only spot where I really belong 
You know our love, called you the preachers' wife 
But the keys to bed lead living it up 
And everybody would know, them seen us in the video 
On the dance floor straight cutting it up 
I love you baby


Let's (come on)let's stay together, let's stay together 
Loving you whether, days are good or bad, or happy or sad

To me, you mean the world 
No matter what it is you say or do 
I always I will be there for you 
So no, no matter what, let's stay together

In the good life, happy or sad 
You mean the world, no matter what is it you say or do 
I always will be there for you 
So no, no matter what, let's stay together 
In the good life, happy or sad 
Let's, let's stay together 
Loving you whether, love is good or bad, and or happy or sad

Ain't no beats to lead somebody you love 
Best thing in life, is to have somebody ya heard 
So keep it together 
Good days, happy or sad
