Ah, Ya, yeah, ya

 
Seen this girl on the block by the boon-ah 
On the spot she was down for the boom-mark 
Drop doc she was rockin a Tupac 
Said: yo D now me, what's you got 
He says: ba boo bang, ba boo bang 
Ba boo bang

 
Seen a girl so crystal clean, I mean 
Since I've been on the scene I've dreamed 
Of girls to tops poofs on rooftops 
Now this girl, who cruises the two pack 
Get this girl in my bathtub, and rub my back rub 
My bathroom's like a nightclub 
A few ladies in my tin to find the limb 
A few ladies in the bin, to put some yellow in 
Any mighty fine fellow men like myself 
To organize the panties on the shelves


Them girls, them girls 
Them girls I do adore

I like em' sweet and fine 
I get a wine to bind 
All kinds I love them all

Them girls, them girls 
Them girls around the way

I like a limit to a lime 
The women so fine sometimes they make me say:

Had a fly girl go called her honey 
Make this spent up all my money 
Fred went to bed with a girl from college, what 
He told me she was looking for dollars 
E to MC that don't get played 
Girls gonna chase him, but they don't get paid 
They might get naked, but they don't get laid 
The school needs girls who made first grade

I like the small girls, I like the tall girls 
I like all the girls looking merry, call girls 
So Run, let's bring the girls in 
And their girlfriends, but no one let the squirrels in 
As for the boyfriends step on joy 
When the girlfriends come home and bring Limp Bizkit toys in 
I like erection when I'm in the states 
But no silicone cause' I don't like the fake shit


Them girls, them girls 
Them girls I do adore

I like em' sweet and fine 
I get a wine to bind 
All kinds I love them all

Them girls, them girls 
Them girls around the way

I like a limit to a lime 
The women so fine sometimes they make me say:

Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls

Yo, yo girls in line now 
Girls galore, girls I've never even seen before 
The way they sway, that makes me smile 
And Run gett a dime on the top of the pile

Girls are freaking things are good 
Girls can fill up my neighborhood 
But don't take my sunshine I'll be OK 
Some seam girlies I hear are snakes


Them girls, them girls 
Them girls I do adore

I like em' sweet and fine 
I get a wine to bind 
All kinds I love them all

Them girls, them girls 
Them girls around the way

I like a limit to a lime 
The women so fine sometimes they make me say

Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls 
Them girls, them girls
