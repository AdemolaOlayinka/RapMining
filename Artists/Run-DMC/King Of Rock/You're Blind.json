    "lyrics": "Tenement buildings, and skyscrapers\n\n\nAre polluted and often invaded\nwith troubled hearts, and weakened minds\nLiving their lives and hoping to find\nthe golden key, to prosperity\nNever have a grip on reality\nThis makes day to day living hard\nTrumpin your fate, never peepin the card\nYou just goin through life without a trace\nwhen the answers you seek are in front of your face\n\nYou're blind!\nTell 'em D!\n\n\nYou're headed for the top, or so you think\nBut that's not true for you, your life is on the brink\nof self-destruction, total corruption\nYou better get out or die from consumption\nSweat for a dollar, to get nothin back\nCause at the end of the week, you still get taxed\nYou'd even sell your soul to make your life correct\nBut with the rate of inflation you should eat your check\nSo you try to make a hustle, to get ahead\nBut the only thing you manage is to stay in the red\nCoppin from John, to sell to Rex\nAnd your jones for success has put your life in check\n\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\n\n\nSo you think the facts means you can't win\nSo you devote your time to a life of sin\n\n\nHangin out late is how you survive\nMakin deals, talkin jive, and tellin lies\nPressure beatin you down\nLike you're not handlin\nAnd all the while, your mind is ramblin\nAbout bein fly\nOr even sly\nAnd bein held low in the public eye\nYou decide these things but you don't know why\nYou're standin on a corner cold playin the post\nCause another sucker you were chillin the most\n\nYou're blind!\nYo you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\n\n\nYou (Run) round talkin bout what you hate\nLivin your life just to perpetrate\nYou think your style is chill, because you're always cold\nwith your platform shoes and your fake gold\nSo you think you're bad\nSheer dynamite\nBut if you only knew the crew called you freak's delight\n\n\nWearin the tightest jeans, and shortest skirt\nYou think you're cold chillin, lookin like a jerk\nNo matter what you do, come out second rate\nThinkin you're on time but you're already late\nYou're blind\n\nYou're blind! And you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\n\nThe moral to the story may not be clear\nAnd the only way to catch it is to lend an ear\nStop frontin so hard\nWhy don't you peep your card?\nAnd your goals in life may not be far\nBecause these words I say are meant for you to hear\nSo if you bust these facts you will persevere\n\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou needs to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\nYou're blind!\nAnd you can't see\nYou need to wear some glasses\nlike D.M.C.\n",
