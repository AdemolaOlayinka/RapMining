    "lyrics": "Well I rehearsed for the verse and I'm number one\nNot the best, not the worst, cause my name is Run\nAnd I'm second cause I wreck it, that you want to see\nAn emcee (like D) inside the place (to be)\nAnd have you heard that he is third and his name is Jay\nI'm Run the A\nD the Deuce\nand Jay's the Tre'\n\n\n\n\nI'm the rapper of the year and this the year of the rap\nAnd I'm never drinkin beer, it's champagne at the tap\nAnd I'm cold makin money on a regular basis\nPullin out, knockin sucker MC faces\nTravel round the world with my mind at ease\nNo Calvin Klein, just wearin Lee's\nGot credit in countries I've never been\ncause the records I write are in the top ten\nThe top of the chart, is where I stay\nbut I also chill, around the way\nIn Hollis, Queeens, is where I stop\nOn the streets with the beats is where I walk\n\n\nWhen I perform, many hearts I warm\nI'm better known, as the Quiet Storm\nI don't talk too much but I got beef\nWhen I kill MC's, I cause grief\nDevestating mic control is my main goal\nMy name is Darryl, and his name is (Joe)\nThe Master of music his name is Jay\nLeave us alone, and let us play\nWe give it up, and turn it loose\nWe're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose\nSucker MC's like punks who are picking flowers\nGo for yours, WE WENT FOR OURS!\n\n\n\nStart at 3, end at 6\nJam Master Jay is on the mix\nFor all the young ladies\nand all the chicks\nWe got all of the girls\non our tips\nDon't buy gold lighters\nonly Bic's\nRock all microphones\njust for kicks\n\n\nSucker MC's I will be snuffin\nIn my pocket I'll keep on stuffin\nWhen I say I'll beat em up I won't be bluffin\nThey can't beef cause that ain't nothin\nBut it don't matter, my pocket gets fatter\nI got more hats than the Mad Hatter\n\n\nWell I'm the rapper with the mic, drive a Caddy not a bike\nDrop a rhyme in your face, and you'll damn sure like\nHe's an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time\nNever ever goin low, cause he only climb\n(And Jay's the DJ with the) cut (move your arm) and your butt\nSo D take the mic, huh hah\n\n\nSay what? I will not stop, I will not quit\nBecause some at the top but I'm on the tip\nThat's as high on the top as you can get\nAnd you best believe, I'll be on it\nSo before you decide, to try me out\nI'm gonna let you all know what I'm all about\nI'm a fresh MC, who's on his way\nto be an MC with the most to say\nAnd to all those out there, that don't know me\nI go by the name of D. M. C.\nIn the place to be, I will MC\nThe Master of the Ceremony cause it's easy to D\nControl of the mic, is so devestating\nthat all other rappers you will soon be hating\nNo matter what race, creed or color\nwhen we pull forward things don't get duller!\n",
