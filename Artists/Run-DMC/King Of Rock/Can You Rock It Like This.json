    "lyrics": "If I eat, a little kid, sticks his finger in my plate\nI be signing autographs, for three months straight\nI got jet-set women, who offer me favors\nMy face is a thousand lipstick flavors\nNeed a sip of lemonade, I'm a slave to my trade\nFrom all these lights my complexion might fade\nSecretary overworked, by a money hungry jerk\nGot a letter, answer woman, won't you freak out on my shirt?\n\nWell can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nCan you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nHuh!!\n\nYour ears are clogged, your head as hard as a log\nMy privacy robbed, let me do my job\nYou funny lookin slob eatin shiskabob\nYou're the reason why my eyes are on the doorknob\n\nCan you rock it like this? I think I rock it like that\nBut can you rock it like this? Homeboy I rock it like that\n\nI'm straining not complaining for a casual life\nSomething normal nuttin formal three kids and a wife\nI'm dying from the spying that you're putting me through\nI perspire I'm on fire when I'm thinking of you\n\nBut can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nWell can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nHuh!!\n\nCan you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nBut can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nHuh!!\n\nNews reporters, invade my borders\nIf I think it I will say it, you might have a recorder\nAnd then, UHH-OHH, the nation's in upheaval\nOld dating always thinking at me evil\nYou're stepping on my heels, you're breathing down my neck\nI'm not Rodney Dangerfield, so give me respect\n\nCan you rock it like this? I-I can rock it like that\nBut can you rock it like this? Homeboy I rock it like that\n\nCan you rock it like this? Yo I can rock it like that\nBut can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nHu-Huh-Huh!! *echoes*\n\nWhat it all adds up to, is just one thing\nRun-D.M.C is, the king of the swing\nAnd if you mess with us, you'll be a real short liver\nYou may be big but our bodyguard's bigger\n\nCan you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nCan you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\n\nCan you rock it like this? I can rock it like that\nCan you rock it like this? Homeboy I rock it like that\n",
