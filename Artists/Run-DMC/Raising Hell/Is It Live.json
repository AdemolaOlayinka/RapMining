Be for real, I'm not a thief\nDictator and hater of those that beef\nThat's right I can fight and I'm the chief\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople in the place don't put D down\nI'm the microphone master the best around\nThere's not too many of my type\nAnd all rap titles I will swipe\nYou'll see me talkin to a girl\nA sweet young thing with jheri curls\nI never ever wore a braid\nGot the peasiest hair and still get paid\n\n\n\nWell I'm dropping MC's with just one punch\nCos it's the baddest of the bunch so call me Capt. Crunch\nSlayin MC's, make em walk the plank\nAnd what's next, start the decks while I count I count my bank\n\n\n\nAnd I'm the wizard of words, the ruler of rap\nNot soft, not a sucka, could never be a sap\nYou might get jacked cos you talk crap\nWhen I bust my rap they all step back\nI'm paid on stage, Run's on my left\nOn his right, on the mic, I recite I'm def\nBecause every performer is only a goner\nKeep all sissy soft suckas off my corner\n\n\n\nCos Darryl Mac will do things like that...\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sophisticated sound, not soft or sour\nIt's servin you suckas, sellin dreams in the shower\nIt's rockin this party hour, hour after hour\nIf a girlie tried to diss this (What's up with that?)\nI won't allow her\nCool chief rapper, I see a girl I tap her\nThen I take her on the floor, she don't dance, I slap her\nThe girl starts to cry and the crowd asks me why\nIf Run says \"dance\" you do or die!\n",
