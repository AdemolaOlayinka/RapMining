It's Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Trrrrrricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky\n\n\n\nIn New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme\nThey really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time\nAnd in the city it's a pity cos we just can't hide\nTinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside\n\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky...(How is it D?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky...Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky) huh!\n\n\n\nWhen I wake up people take up mostly all of my time\nI'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cos I make up a rhyme\nI'm not braggin', people naggin' cos they think I'm a star\nAlways tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far\nA girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play\nThen D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay\nI ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cos I'm on TV\nThey even bother my poor father cos he's down with me\n\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky...(How is it?) Tricky (Tricky) Tricky (Tricky)\nIt's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time\nIt's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tr-Tr-Tr-Tricky) Tr-tr-tr...\n\n\n\nWe are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)\nThey offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone\nIt's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit\nYou keep on (rock!) shock! Cos this is it...\n",
