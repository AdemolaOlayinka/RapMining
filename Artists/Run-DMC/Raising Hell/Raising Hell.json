    "lyrics": "Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings\nWe're raisin hell like a class when the lunchbell rings\nThe king will be praised, and hell will be raised\nS-s-s-suckers try to faze him but D won't be fazed\nSo what's your name? D.M.C.! The King is me!\nYour High-ness, or His Majesty!\nNow you can debate, c-c-c-concentrate\nBut you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great!\n\nDissin all devils, causin havoc in HELL\nAt a very high level base and treble shall YELL\nHeard in the heavens are the sounds supreme\nSo clear to the ear it is sometimes seen\nSo loud like a cloud with thunder and LIGHTNING\nSo proud to the crowd it is somewhat FRIGHTENING\nNo calm in the storm like a beast unleashed\nThere's no stoppin cause the rockin cannot cease; BREAK!\n\n\nYou see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft\nCourageous and contagious so you better break North\nNot a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?\nJust listen while I'm dissin cause you're pissin me off\nCold bedding is spreading all across your face\nYou can't take when I break and if that's the case\nI'll go on, and on, and kick the bass\nSo back up off the cup while I take my taste\n\n\nIt's highly appraised when the hell is raised\nSo demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed\nThe unbelieving receiving prophecy so true\nI cut the head off the Devil and I throw it at you\nMy mighty mic control, already brought his soul\nThe rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll\nA black hat is my crown, symbolizin the sound\nSignifyin, we won't play around; BUST IT!\n\n\nRappin and climbin beat-makin every day\nNo synthesizer sound, so silence when I say\nI am great, get it straight, cause that's my fate\nMy name is Run I'm number one, that's how I rate\nHe's in the place with the bass, and style and grace\nHis name is J he's here to play, and win this race\nHe's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D\nKind of tall yes y'all, he's down with me\n\n\nFrom the mountain valley to the deep blue sea\nThe word is heard as told by D\nI don't sing I bring, much delight\nLike a star shinin bright in the darkest night\nIf you are cold, I'll bring you heat\nLike I brought the whole world my funky beat\nMysterious and serious I ain't no joke\nFire from the depths of hell AND YOU CAN SMELL THE SMOKE!\n\n\nKickin and tickin while you're havin a ball\nLike chicken finger lickin I'll be vickin you all\nSo do the bird, have you heard, did they give you a call\nJust me and D.M.C., cold shakin the walls\n\n\nThere's no fearin when hearin sound of this kind\nAcross the land every man is goin out of his mind\nOn the face of the earth spreadin like disease\nContaminating infiltrating like a horde of bees\n\n\nLord of lyrics, duke of discussion\nRuler of rock, your king at cold-crushin\nPuller of people - controller of crowds\nLingering lyrics all lasting and loud\n\n\nLeft y'all, ah to the left y'all\nbecause I rock upon the mike real def y'all\n\n\nAnd to the right y'all, ah to the right y'all\nbecause I rock upon the mike all night y'all\n\n\nYou see, I..\n\n\n.. want respect, if I'm correct\nThey're all like a ball that I have checked\nAnd the shots they take have no effect\nThe pope try to dope but he broke his neck\nCause I rock harder, and I get farther\nYou wanna battle D hey please don't bother\nTo waste your time, messin with my rhyme\nThe only kick you get out of is in the behind!\nttin' behind\n",
