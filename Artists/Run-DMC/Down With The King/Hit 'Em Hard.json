Another boom bash\nSee me and first thing they'll be like cursin I'm rehearsin it\nYou're weak and you're wack and you'll be the second and I'm first in it\nComin at you hard with God we're never feelin odd\nTell me how you figure pull the trigger nigga gettin scarred\nTroop without a care my dear, you never hear a fear\nStandin in the corner my daughter, you wanna - call me\nYou wanna call me out, you wanna call me out\nYou wan' you wan' you wanna wanna call me out a with the\ntrendy wear and your nappy hair\nNever give a glare too rare you just stare\nPrepare for your prayer, remember the tear\nCause Run'll beat ya, got to reach ya, ??, and I'ma\n",
