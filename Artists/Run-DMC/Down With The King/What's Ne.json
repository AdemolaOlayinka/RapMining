So..\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nin this direction, where do we go from here?\n\n\n\n\nNow bust it pen to the hand I am the grand writer\nWrote a plan for you ma'am and damn, beautiful\nto make you move to my groove is here\nSo my dear be of good cheer I make it perfectly clear\nNot number two you're the one when all is said and is done\nSerious as the cancer give a answer to Run, so..\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nin this direction, where do we go from here?\n\n\n\n\nI kick the lyrics strictly wreckin the head\nNot forgetten what is written, stickin to what is said\nWhen D is MC'n there's no bein mislead\nGot to have her and like Shabba I am wicked in bed (hehehehe)\nThe woman made me wonder, she's the one I will wed\nSo I turned to the ??, and a dis is what I said\nI said give me your number I'ma give you a call\nCheck it out y'all, check it out y'all\nCheck out my records, I make my message clear\nin this direction, where do we go from here?\n",
