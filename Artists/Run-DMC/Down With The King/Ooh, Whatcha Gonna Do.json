What's the word up?\nPress your luck or buck another sucker just ducked\nOoh, whatcha gonna do\n\n\nA vain from my brain means I'm causin em pain\nComin rough with the stuff that's just a part of the game\nThe rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam\nSo I'ma pull my jammy out and I'ma murder the man\nBust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul\nTake the trigger then you figured that I'm losin control\nI go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold\nAnd I broke those pros with the dope flows\nI slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those\nLeave the blunts for the punks in front rows\nI said mine, headline or deadline\nYou see redline, here comes your bedtime\nI lay it down, lay it low\nNow I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow\nI flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son\nfill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one\n\nNever let a punk get away with murder\nGun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a\nWhat's up? What's up? What's the word up?\nPress your luck or buck another sucker just ducked\nOoh, whatcha gonna do\n..\n\n\nNow mic check and respect, come correct, and I can protect\nYou never knew (DJ who?) DJ Run'll wreck\nhard, God, may be dope you never knew me nope\nWhere you been your hand is sendin DOWN, can you really cope?\nForever makin and breakin it and cold wreckin it\nAs for my title it's vital, you're never TAKIN it\nI throw a stand across the stage and you'll get BUCKED down\nLike Kris-One said, I fly a head you better _Duck Down_\nI sold good and then plenty like ? Charlie said\nLike Mike I glove it you love it and now it's for my bread\nIt's goin down on the mound watch a nigga pitch\nBang your thang and hang your damn NECKS, now you gettin it\nI see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin weak\nAnd now I'm flippin the script and they can hardly speak\nI bust a nut then run amuck all on a sucker COOL\nNow whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?!\n\nNever let a punk get away with murder\nGun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a\nWhat's up? What's up? What's the word up?\nPress your luck or buck another sucker just ducked\nOoh, whatcha gonna do\n\nNever let a punk get away with murder\nGun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a\nWhat's up? What's up? What's the word up?\nPress your luck or buck another sucker just ducked\nOoh, whatcha gonna do\n\nNever let a punk get away with murder\nGun shots, gun shots, all you heard-a\nWhat's up? What's up? What's the word up?\nPress your luck or buck another sucker just ducked..\n",
