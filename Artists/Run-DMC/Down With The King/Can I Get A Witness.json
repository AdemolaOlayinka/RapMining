(Yes you can!)\n\n\nNew jacks better back up, before they get smacked up\nby the R-U-N-D-M-C (that's where it's at cuz)\nKnown as the tough cats, kickin tough rough raps\nIn jeans, leather jackets, my Adidas and gangster hats\nA ??, yo here we go\nI'm tired of brothers tryin to front like they don't hear me though\nKnowin if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be able\ncause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh\nA lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet\nAlbum number seven and we still ain't finished yet\nI didn't get old, I got better at the craft\nSat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh\nSo get back, you already had your chance to dance\nYou proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants\nWord to God, I'm back fo' sho'\nHollis Queens gettin wreck so act like you know\n\n\n\n\nAs I spit this and get this out of my throat\nI need a witness to get with this - take notes\nGreat quotes like boats float flowin so dope\nNever givin up hope, nope, know what I wrote\nI'ma saver spectator educator entertainer\nYou wanna ask me, can't be now or later\nI'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start\nDarryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart\n(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run\nBut if you wanna step up, step up and get that ass - done)\nA reporter with recorder was recordin the slaughter\nas I'm peepin 'cross the border leapin water keepin order\nLit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit\nCause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits\nDippin down to grip this microphone I rip this\nI'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness\n\n\n\n\nCan I get a witness, can I hit a, never been ?? fitness\nDon't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best\nand I make a suggestion save it David with your bull\nCause you're full of congestion\nSoft? Never me, never get more hard\nThe King of Kings, Lord of Lords, is the one Lord God\nCan I can I get a witness ?? next\nTo my God, DJ Run and I kick it\n\n\nSuckers suckers suckers\nSuckers get flipped when I start to flip\nSlip in a clip when they die I dip\nStill spray a gun, see how DJ Run\nLeave a sucker stunned, gettin ill to the drum\nMic check and I wreck and I'm second to none\nAccept it don't regret it I expect to get dumb\nSo don't you forget this, we'll put you on the hitlist\nto stick ya stick ya wicked wickedest can I get a witness\n",
