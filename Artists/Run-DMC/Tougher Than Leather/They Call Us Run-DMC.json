I rule\nI come to town they stare ( Cause D.M.C.) is cool\n? because, the crowd, is on it\nDrop this beat and pause, the tables are turning\nBreak backs on track and I can even act\nSo max, relax, new jacks, and get the facts from\n\n\n\n\nThey call us on the phone\nThey call us all alone\nThey call us where we roam\nThey call us when we're home\nThey call us up to par\nThey call us in our cars\nThey call us in the bars\nThey call us superstars!\nThey call us\n\n\n\n\"Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay...\"\n",
