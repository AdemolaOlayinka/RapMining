D that's me, the King, the MC\nRhyme get mine on the t-o-p\nCan another MC ever rock this beat? (Hell yeah)\n\n\nIt's like the A the B to the C\nIt's easier than (1, 2, 3)\n(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)\nSo here's Run\nIt's time for we to cease (So what?)\nSo rhymers speak your peace\nWhy? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)\nCause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)\nDance to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow\nChance to give em is done I told yo\nFor these routines like 1983\nIt's just a little reminder\nSo those suckas is kinder\nA little message from (Run-D.M.C.)\n\n\nCuts for days will amaze and maze\nBut will make you sad to tan all the dance aways\nGot the mic, the man, the master plan\nBut the ram, the jam\n(Know I am?) Goddamn!\nSpins he wins, clocking MS ends\nTo his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends\nJay lose today, this is what I say\n(Dick in your mouth all day)\n\n\nMy beats were played and laid rhymes made\nJay DJ'ed and I got paid\nMade something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)\nYes my brother I would do it for you\nI roam in the zone of the microphone\nAnd I'm on the throne but I'm not alone\nGot bones of steel and not of stone\nI'm known to be prone and make your momma moan\n\n\nTime for the rhyme so let the stars shine\nShame for the fame and the name combined\nRun for the fun but you can gimme your ring\nShow I gotta go so now a word from the King\n\n\nHardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more\nAnd like I said before...\nBeats to the rhyme the name of this jam\nD that's me and that's who I am\nRocking on the mic cause you know I can\nYou gotta understand I don't give a damn\n\n\nJay hit a play today I must say\nHooray to the way that is A-OK\nAs we wax the tracks all the DJ's play\nWith (dick in your mouth)\nA little (dick in your mouth)\nA big (dick in your mouth all day)\n",
