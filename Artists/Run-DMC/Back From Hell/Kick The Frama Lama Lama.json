Don't ever close your lid\ncause if you sleep I keep the cheap motherfuckin\ntape you gave me, so behave see\nMy name is Run and I'll run this ruler up your ass\nand measure the shit you're poppin\nThere's no stoppin or coppin or playin with me\nyou see, I'll break your fuckin neck, I'm deadly!\n",
