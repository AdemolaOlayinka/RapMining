As we come back on..\nAs we come back on..\nAll in your face, I place this rhyme!\nFacin this crew, you're facin your doom\nYou got punched in the face\nas soon as you heard this tune!\n\nI race at a pace with no shoelaces\nto racist faces, placin disgraces\nTaste the bass of the racial facial\nDisgraceful tasteless racist faces\nGet out my face, don't bass, don't waste my time\nmy brother, I'm not color blind\nI walk the face of the Earth, face death\nface the best and I'll just\nrip flip and trip won't shut up or let up\nGet out my face so we can go head up\n(Damn D!) Yo yo yo they don't understand me\n?? when they always try to ban me\nHypin the stereotype of a face\nand that's the problem with the human race\nHaste makes waste, don't trace to other places\nWe're all the same but with different faces\n..\n\n\nYeah D, and everywhere I go I see faces\nFaces sweatin you and they sweatin faces\nAround around the world, international faces\nYeah, now bust it\n\nYo, I took a look in the face of a girlie\nThe way she looks that Jay must say\nsomethin bout the way my afro is growin\nBut is it funky? (YEAH!) Well okay\nIs she jockin my 'fro or my fade?\nDo she want me because of my name?\nI like the ladies, sweet and serious\nnot those hoes, that plays, the game\non every Tom Dick and Harry\nShawn Jerry John Nick Curly Moe and Larry\nYou thinkin you married? Well you CRAZY\nmy baby you won't carry\nCause I like a girl that's low-key\nThat's how it's gotta be to be with me\nAnd I'll take her to all the exotic places\nThe name of this jam is called FACES\nYeah.. so many faces..\nand everywhere I go I see faces\nand everywhere you go you see, the faces\nInternational faces, I'm a Afro and I'm outta here..\n",
