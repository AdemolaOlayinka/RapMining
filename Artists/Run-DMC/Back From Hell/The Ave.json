I must be dreaming\nEverybody's ?? when I see men dealing\nfor a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke\nSometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke\nMany many many records broke laws, broke jaws\nA few months ago I had to \"Pause\"\nDuring that time, me and my man\nwas chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands\nA beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot\nIt was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot\nI seen him drop - then came the cops\nSayin, \"Nobody run - everybody stop\"\nI wanted to run, cause I was carryin my gun\nDarryl Mack packin mine, strapped with my nine\nEveryone on the wall, that's what the cop said\nEveryone complied, except Bald Dread, he said,\n\"Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat\nYo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'im Darryl Mack\"\nI turned around and said, \"Word up cop!\"\nHe said, \"D.M.C., take your ass down the block\"\nIf it happened to him, it could happen to you\ncause that's what's happenin on The Avenue\nwhen I.. \"uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh..\"\n\"Na-na-na-na-na! The Ave.\"\n\n\nNow on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin away\nI got the feelin the illin will never ever pay\nCause on the street, you're never in the fast lane\nYou go to jail or get a bullet in your brain\nPeople laugh and smile at a stick-up\nA young man in a rut, shakin a big cup\nPeople pass his ass and say, \"Tough luck\"\nTo waste time for a dime is cold fucked up\nA loud shot in the air - not rare\nA brother fell to the ground, nobody cares\nYou ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh\nNobody give a damn, that's how they livin on The Ave.\n... AUUUGH!\n\n\nAway from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets\nAnother world of girls that crawl the backseats\nSystems that are kickin, sinkin many black beats\n(This and that goin on ?? street)\nI remember the time there was a jam in ??\n??, the music, no ?? til after dark\nThat's when the shit starts happening\n(Brother from The Ave. this and that again)\nBody move in the back and a quarter in the jar\nFind the rules by the basketball court in the park\nAnd the ? by the bench where the 40 dogs spark\nThe crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark\nThe young, hung, and swung on a swing\nGlidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling\nI didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw\n(Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore)\nI'm throwin fate to the gate ??\n(And my man from Japan got vicked for sure)\nDo me a favor when you roll with your crew\nYou gotta check out, check out, The Avenue\n",
