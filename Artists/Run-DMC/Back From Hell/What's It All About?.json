SEER CAUSE I'M REASON WITH RUN\nAnd now that the point is out\nLet the jam slam my man and tell me\nwhat's it all about?\n\n\n\n\n\nI flex my muscle, what I must do\nis bumrush you, FUCK YOU I'll crush you\nThe Ku Klux Klan is fucked up\nAnd every good man'll understand\nBeginnin and winnin, from the first fuckin vocal\nI spoke to you, I ain't no joke to you\nI do what I want to do\nIf you don't like what me and my crew is doin then FUCK YOU\nWhat I do and what I done with Jay and Run\nNone could ever become, to sum it up bum..\nget off my DICK and out my KINGDOM\n(Yo yo D tell em where you're from)\nStraight from Hollis, Queens\nI'm still eatin collard greens and I'm doin the same things\nI ain't never goin out suckers..\npunk motherfuckers!\nWhat's it all about?\n",
