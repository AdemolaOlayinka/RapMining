I know you wanna play\nThe funky jam I never quit until the break of day\nHere we go on a Afrolistic journey\nHere come the jam but don't forget to bring ??\nto make sure the beat is upheld\nThe beat is raw and Run's banged it well\nto make it take you to your destination\nIt's just the jam that slam across the nation\nI gotta rock, you know I gotta good rhyme\nSo grab a girl, and listen to the good times\nNow sweat til you're wet and get done\nand I'll bet you get some..\nheat to release the piece to have fun\nSo just grab a girl, cause it's party time\n\n\n\n\nGroove, breathe, wind blowin the leaves\nI'm at ease, can you feel the funky sensation\nI might take a vacation\non the seven seasons\nReasons to be cheerful, sun shinin, Run rhymin\nI'm right behind him\nJay, you know where to find him\nShinin like a diamond, if I'm lyin I'm dyin\n{girrrrrrrrrrrls, drive me crazy}\nSo fine, goin out of my mind\nI keep em goin, they sayin, I've got the rhyme\nOoze, cruise, gonna take a cruise\nJing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling I'm never singin the blues\nAfros, studios, doin shows\nfour-O's I suppose, no one knows\nwho's rockin the hoes, tell me that\nYou gotta be (funky)\n\n\n\n\nNow let your body be free\nAnd yeah, go you know\nNever slow the flow til it's time to go\nCause that ain't the way you play the crowd\nYou gotta mingle, single girls allowed\nSo round em up, get a cutie in the spot\nLook at the booty, do me, time to rock\nAnd make all the girls give up the play\nGet on the floor and make your day\nSo you're illin, still it's four o'clock\nYou won't leave til you see em close the spot\nYou gotta stay til they play the last song\ntil the night gives light to the early morn'\nCheck the place and the taste of the bass is on the case\nA negative thought that you brought just erased\nPut away the nine and keep in mind\nthat the jam'll slam when it's party time\n",
