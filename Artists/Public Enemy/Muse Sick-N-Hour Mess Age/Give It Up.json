Yeah, you got ta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yeah\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up now\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nCome again with the same old bounce\nI'm calling a foul and once again it counts\nMad tense, mad tense brothers know\nThe blunts in the back got the black behind and that's wack\nAnd once again it's on!\nHey, Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin', \"I don't care\", it's on\nI'm comin' with a rhyme, what? I'm lettin' go a rhyme, yeah!\nI gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times\nYou call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her\nThey don't hear me though, so here I go\nI'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher\nWhen I'm takin' his sound to bring you down\nRappers rippin' a lyrical kickin' finger-lickin'\nBut to the rhythm I'm givin' but never cotton pickin'\nLike James Brown I'm sayin' it loud\nAm I loud enough? Huh, you got ta give it up\nSome ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change\nSome ain't gonna never ever change\nSome ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change\nSome ain't gonna never, ever change\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up now\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nAnd when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum\nSome second guessing my lessons about saving young\nSome don't know like Run said, \"So here we go\"\nWhere it is inside, whoop, there it is\nThere it is, there it is, damn right\nMy man X is a bad mother, shut your mouth\nI'm talking about Terminator, he's the man\nThere it is, can you hit me off with another one\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up now\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up now\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nI never did represent doing dumb shit\nSome gangsta lying, I'd rather diss Presidents\nDead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing 'em\nI vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing 'em\nFlick 'em, and I fling 'em, you can go with 'em\nHall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing 'em\nGo Grandmama, close but no cigar\nI got mine for I'm using my rhyme\nThe flow go wherever I want, and that's clever\nGive a piece of my time to prevent some crime\nAnd who behind puttin' the guns to the young ones\nThe ones that make 'em is the ones that take 'em\nRugged for no reason, down in duck season\nI don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor\nSo check yaself before ya wreck yaself\nRespect yaself, hah, you got ta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up yo\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\nGive it up, give it up, give it up now\nGive it up, give it up, gotta give it up\n...\n",
