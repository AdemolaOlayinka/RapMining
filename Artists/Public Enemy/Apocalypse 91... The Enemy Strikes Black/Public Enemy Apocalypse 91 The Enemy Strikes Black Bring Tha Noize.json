    "lyrics": "Bass! How low can you go?\nDeath row what a brother knows\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nThe rhyme animal\nThe incredible D. Public Enemy number one\nFive-O said \"Freeze!\" and I got numb\nCan't I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?\nBut it's the wax that the Terminator X spun\nNow they got me in a cell 'cause my records they sell\n'Cause a brother like me said \"Well\nFarrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to\nWhat he can say to you, what you ought to do\"\nFollow for now, power to the people say,\n\"Make a miracle. D, pump the lyrical\"\nBlack is back, all in, we're gonna win\nCheck it out, yeah y'all, here we go again\n\nTurn it up! Bring tha noize!\nNever badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad\nAt the fact that's corrupt as a senator\nSoul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope\n'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope\nListen for lessons I'm saying inside music that the critics are blasting me for\nThey'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across the\ncountry has us up for the war\nWe got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait\nTill we get it right\nRadio Stations I question their blackness\nThey call themselves black, but we'll see if they play this\n\nGet from in front of me, the crowd runs to me\nMy deejay is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know\nHe can cut a record from side to side\nSo what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide\nSoul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll\nMusic for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man\nMakin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know\nYou call 'em demos, but we ride limos, too\nWhatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you\nBeat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono\nRun DMC first said a deejay could be a band\nStand on its feet, get you out your seat\nBeat is for Eric B, and L.L. as well, hell\nWax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells\nEver forever, universal, it will sell\nTime for me to exit, Terminator X-it\n\nFrom coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose\n'Stand, my man? The beat's the same with a boast dose\nRock with some pizzazz, it will last why you ask?\nRoll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as\nWe got to pleed the fifth, we can investigate\nDon't need to wait, get the record straight\nHey, posse's in effect, got the Flavor Terminator\nX to sign checks, play to get paid\nWe got to check it out down on the avenue\nA magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you\nYeah, I'm telling you\n",
