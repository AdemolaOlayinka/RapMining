Hawkes and I'm down wit' the cop scene\nI'm a rookie and I'm rollin' wit' a swat team\nPackin' a nine can't wait to use it\nCrooked cop yeah that's my music\nUp against the wall don't gimme no lip son\nA bank is robbed and you fit the description\nAnd I ain't your mama and I ain't your pops\nKeep your music down or you might get shot\nThis is a warning so watch your tail\nOr I'm a have to put your ass in jail\nI'm the police and I'm in charge\nYou don't like it get the fuck outta Dodge\n",
