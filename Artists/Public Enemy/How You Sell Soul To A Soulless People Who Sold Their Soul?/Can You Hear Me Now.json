    "lyrics": "Damn if i be some slave again\nGot no fake ass friends no timbs or rims\nSure nuff dont know no designer names\nAnd i never played no video games\nI aint got no diamond rings\nNo bling, bling, no minks\nNo 2 earrings\nNo pimp glasses mugs\nOr cups and things\nOr whatever the hell they be\nCarryin\nDont treat my highs too high\nOr my lows too low\nYou wont see my soul souled on no video\nBdont need no checks to get no chicks\nOr be some hypocrite to get you on my\nSo let the young sing and rap to the young\nAs long as yall dont think freedom\nIs free to be dumb\n\n\nIts suicidal to think im your american idol\nHypnotic trapped in a 3000 mile box\nChicks bobby sox today be botox\nNow that hip hops the new so called rock\nParents dressin the outside\nOf their kids\nAn what they wear\nInstead of stressin the inside\nWay back , my peoples gave me pride\nNow in 2004 i aint gotta hide\nIf you cant afford it just leave it to the side\nCause you looking real stupid with that tear in your eye\nGotta a 1994 hear you talkin\nBut its damn sure better than walkin\nIt might be old, it sure aint gold\nBetter than stylin in the cold\nIt aint no rolls,so wont get stoled\nBut you wont see me walking on no side of the road\n\n\nAt the age i am now\nIf i cant teach\nI shouldnt even open up my mouth begin to speak\nI need some radio\nTo help me reach\nBut i heard they get their money on\nBy makin you weak\nDrowning in the sea of\nSome big dose of now\nNo past no future\nLet the young grow wild\nAint gave em nuttin\nSome done robbed the child\nFrom substance\nDont currr , fill em up wit style\nLike hip hop started on trl, like wow\nTook the game and made it a gdamn shame\nHell wit history you dont even\nKnow my name\nI aint the same damn thing\nThat yall used to playin\nIm non stop rocket\nHeadin to your brain\nNow thats what im sayin\n\n\nI may not got no flow\nBut i aint pimped by no negro\nBacked by some\nCracka wit\nHis ass by the door\nTherefore\nI can never be poor\nCause my mind , body, and soul\nCannot be sold\nPriceless\nSo i avoid the trifelin\nWorms in my cipher\nStuff yall cant get enough off\nGots no time for\nSomebodys jail\nMy time is just like the US mail\nMy time is richer\nThan them new astro pitchers\nI be damn if my face\nBe under some picture\nWhere you heard the nword\nSo save your liquid\nPe we just here to flip it\nFind somebody new to get wit\nThe next time you hear a\nCat who cant Stand or even look in the mirror\n",
