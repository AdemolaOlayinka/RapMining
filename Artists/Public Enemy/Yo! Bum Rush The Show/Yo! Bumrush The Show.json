Bum rush the show\nI am taking no prisoners, taking no shorts\nBreakin' with the metal of a couple of forts\nWhile we're hearin' that boom supplement the mix\nGonna rush 'em like the Bears in the 46\nHomeboys I don't know but they're part of the pack\nIn the plan against the man, bum rush attack\nFor the suckers at the door, if you're up and around\nFor the suckers at the door, we're gonna knock you back down\n\nYo! Bum rush the show\nYo, around\nYou're gonna tell us, man\nThat we can't get inside your spot?\nYo man, let me tell you somethin', man\nWe came all the way down here from the Welch\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nYo man, you're talkin' about gettin' busy\nYo, you wanna get busy?\nCome on, let's step to the back\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nI take you to the back and show you some of my techniques\nAnd I'll stomp a mud hole in your ass\nBitch\nSearchin my body for fuckin' what\nMy gun's just for fun and my knife don't cut\nHow can I make you understand\nI get ill on a posse with my goddamn hands\nTroubles, not me, I don't mean to cause\nBut you took one look and began to pause\nDidn't hoolar at the dollar we was willin' to spend\nBut you took one look, wouldn't let our ass in\n\nYo homes, I don't know what you're talkin' about, man\nBut yo, bust a move man\nYo, me and my crew, we were in a four limo over last night\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nAnd they are on their way my crib, man\nNow yo, when you feel a\ntalkin' that garbage\nYo, me and my crew got cold crash this side of the door\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nTalkin' about a nine?\nYo, a nine ain't gonna stop the bum rush, homes\n\nCold bum rushin' doors like at first it's something\nAll we realize that the show ain't nuthin'\nFor the stunts and the blunts, whole world inside\nThe reason that the mighty used force supplied\nNo comp, we'll stomp all in our way\nGave me static so I don't pay\nIt might be a trick that you don't like\nComin' in the side door then I'm grabbin' the mike\nWalkin' and talkin' - fist full in the air\nIt might seem like that we don't care\nA ho for an oh, a pow for an ow\nGirls start screamin' all I say is wow\nGet that sucker who shot that gun\nWhip his monkey ass till it ain't no fun\n5-O showed and wouldn't you know\nThey blamed it on the kid cause all I said was...\n\nYeeaah man, yo\nI was at the park last night\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nGold clocks for megadollars, man\nAn' these brothers, man\nWalked up to me talkin' about they was gonna stick me up\nYo, man, let me tell you somethin', man\nThese are the same brothers, man, that tried to stick up\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nBut yo, I got a posse, man\nThat wouldn't let them bum rush my operation\nYa know what I'm sayin'\n",
