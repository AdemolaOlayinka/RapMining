Yeah the 'g' lied.\"\nStuck in the corner while the 'g' cried\nAnd then from the back - my homeboys came\nWear Uzis and knives and said, \"Go blame.\"\nYa lying ass girl with the fake tears\nWe got a big posse and we show no fears\nWe got too - too - too much posse\nWe got too - too - too much posse\nYeah, that's right\nAnd I'm get ready to step off\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nAnd all you posses out there\nThat's trying to help posse to posse\nYo, we gotta stop that as\nScatter your brain from here to White Plains\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nWe got the shit that you just can't fuck with\n",
