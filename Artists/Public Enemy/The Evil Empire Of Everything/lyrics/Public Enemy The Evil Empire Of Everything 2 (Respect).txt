Public Enemy
The Evil Empire Of Everything
2012)
Dave cut the record 
Down to the bone
Now hes on the bass
I'm on the microphone
Real talk new york
So now we rock
1 rhyme at a time 
Old school design
You candance to it
Romance to it
Throw your hands in the air
Take a chance to it
Run till its dark
Knock it out the park
Rock that box
With the real hip hop 
Ordodox
Not on my watch
Ain't paying for pay
To pay no jox
Beats doing work 
Rhymes in reverse 
My hood is hurt
From all the dirt
Underneath them streets
And all concrete
Is mother earth 
For all its worth
Pay attention
Cheapest price to pay
Might save your life 
Give you another day 
And rock on
