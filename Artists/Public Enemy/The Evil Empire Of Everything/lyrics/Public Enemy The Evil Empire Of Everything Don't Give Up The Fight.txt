Public Enemy
The Evil Empire Of Everything
2012)
I occupy
The planet earth
I testify 
Its a piece of woirk
I'm gratified
Down to the dirt
Been around the world a few times
So I seen the hurt
Quakes hurricanes and tornados
Warning times to mans designs
Under that concrete
Yall call the street
The heart of land
You can hear the beat
Pain of all the lies
Pain in all them lives
Pain of losin homes
Pain of the unknown
Pain of what you spent
Pain of government
No matter what you say 
You don't pay
Here they come to take it away
Don't give up the fight 
Foreign lands and the 7 seas
Radiation is the worlds disease
Bringing nations down to the knees
Mother nature she ain't pleased 
Trees diseased
Deep freeze
Doin us like that govt cheese
Smell that burning in the breeze
Summertime 120 degrees
Pain of all the lies
Pain in all them lives
Pain of losin homes
Pain of the unknown
Pain of what you spent
Pain of government
No matter what you say 
You don't pay
Here they come to take it away
Don't give up
Don't give up the fight 
So shut em down
In appreciation
Of the world itself
And gods creation
What good is the hood if you up to no good
Them govt gangsters would hang you on wood
Stop the tape
My minds stuck in 68
Haight asbury
Now our ass buried in hate
I paraphrase
Beyond the gaze
A haze hovers over a crowd that disobeys
Staying rich off them so called better days
Do I do a song for the masses
Besides whats moving them asses
I make stew out of the ashes
