Public Enemy
The Evil Empire Of Everything
2012)
From the pages of the cress theory, I know you hear me
If you out there, listen up, u might feel me
Do I, look suspicious on this track, wit the black in it
Black hoodie, consciousness and black facts
Young kid shot, is the cry we heard
Like emmitt til, it was tears and our hearts fell
No arrest warrant and no weapon found
One eye witness, black body down
I can hear it now, it's the same ole racist shit
Thought he had a gun, is the same ole some bullshit
Confessions, of a trigger happy hit man
Murderous homicidal nature, there racist plan
Burying our black boys, blood thirsty hungar games
The face of race is white, they got no shame
Stand your ground, legalize lynch law
Touch another black kid you have to touch us all

Its time to stand up and just fight for what you believe in
I don't call it violence I just call it self defense, call it black intelligence braw to you by the people
You just in it to get it, I am in it to make a change, in it to change the game, in it to rearrange, modern day lynching
All that leave us is pain, knowledge is power, all I give you is with brains, you see its money power respect, all seems the same.

Get fear looks 
But I live round here
My house right next to yours
But I still get stares
In a
World of wrongness 
And fights for the strongest 
What's the innocent to do 
When the fight gets brought kid
No way your that scared of my hoodie 
People everywhere getting snared over hoodies
Seen a couple pairs get aired by the hoodies
But
They don't care
My skin's bared under hoodies

This world is so chaotic
all I witness is violence
Watching my brothers die and their sons grow with no guidance
Truth's what I'm providing
to all those who've been blinded
Being sold this equality bullshit I ain't buying
I'm so sick and tired of being profiled and instantly
Watched close suspiciously because of my ethnicity
So stereotypical its despicable
And every black male in a hoodie isn't a criminal

This is everyday life where I'm from it goes on but I swear it can not go beyond trevon because I'm wearing a hoodie I gotta get shot or stopped by the cops its not just in flordia its out in farrock people really expect us to act civil right we got a black president and still fighting for civil rights we need to come togeather and unite because its time to fight the power so put your fists up in the sky 

Freed the ass
Mind followed 
With raps that killed tomorrow
Cant support it
Fought it
But somebody bought it
Community caught it 
But the government taught it
And all you heard 
Violence hard drugs sex and murder
Songs never hated artists who
Keep making em
Strong against the wrong
Whats been created
But look
Many neighborhoods still devestated 
I say it
Flows overrated 
Shows underrated
I hate it
When its degrated and downgraded
Spittin copywritten
To music
Some of yall grew up to use it
People don't dance to it and just abuse it
Yall say that
When I say this
Injustice still goes on
Beyond trayvon
Thank you nme sun
For this word to the young
You the future
Save our daughters and sons
