    "lyrics": "I know a silent nation in dislocation\nFrustration from legislation\nLed to demographic in isolation\nAnother participation in decapitation\n10-4 die river deep mountain high\nIs a wall stuck between dying and doing time\nCant ignore smack dab border war\nAs the beat goes on, words flowed on\nI caught the law\nPyramids machu pichu\nThings they don't teach you\nDon't apologize\nYou were here first on this earth\nBefore these millennial cowboys claimed their turf\nNow who's 1000 miles and ran\nDeserted in the desert\nWild wild west hurt to the dirt\nAnti immigration\nAgainst brown swkin\nSounds like brown shirts\nSilenced by so called legal violence\nSomebody had permission\nTo put humans in this condition\nThis land is who's land??\nThey must've forgot\nKicking the black in the ass\nWhile keeping the brown out\nThis one sided law makes me scream and shout\nI. c. e. is what I'm talking about\n\nSgt hawke and I'm found where the cop be\nI get on illegals like I'm a paparazzi\nYou see the flash but it ain't a camera\nGunfire shells hot enough to damage ya\nNo trafficking no drug smuggling\nI.c.e and we came in thugging\nStraight off the wire like snoop and chris\nYou get rush like limbargh we get at you quick\n\nWhat will they do when they find out about this\nCome for me, for what I represent\nThis is my accent and I'm proud of it.\nWe're bunches and cannot be stopped\nAbsurd laws with racist intentions\nBenefit only to these classifiers\nThey insist, I insist - so here we go\nBroken chains, jumping borders\nThrive or die, we're no longer satisfied\nIts time for power to change hands\nMore righteous humans, is more human rights\nThey say, they owners, but we were here first\nThe world is free and without fear we broadcast\nMulti-color race, is how we're painted\nI have a dream and that dream has become my desire\nPower to my peoples, not power to the governments\n\nCar radios highway hoes\nMotorbike types\nSkateboard whores watch em close them doors\nClap them hands and stomp them feet\nTo more government wars\nGood man bad government\nGreat driver wack car\nSo I seen it before\nMarxism dual citizens\nChina support\nMeaning yall go get a passport\nSlavery is americas past sport\nHomeland security\nAgainst my homeboys securing me\nChained brains diaspora\nComin nafta\nThe same idea of the united states of africa\nBering strait\nBefore palin and paleface\nWaiting for the ice to break\n70% of americans ain't been no place\nSo the human race gets displaced\nWhile the greedy man\nSees the land\nHis plan\nSeize the land\nTo feed his face\nA child lost in the wild\nPicked your food\nBuilt your house\nWhile still on exile\nBarbed wire and cactus the new middle passage\nTo a person\nThis new whirl odors just rehearsing\n\nBy the time I get to the end of my verse\nCalisthenics of the tongue exercising the first\nThat's freedom of speech so I speak my right\nSeems to me there will always be powers to fight\nSo chuck let them know that the bulls break ice\nWith the power of these words that we put within a mic\nLike those in the past put power to pen\nIt was number 13 made us all equal men\nNow arizona back to legislate the hate\nGuess freedom ain't free on this side of the gate\nBut everything changes if I look a certain way\nSecuring the homeland from how it was made\nNow the ice that we skate upon is definitely thin\nBut we got to break bad to let the good begin\nA cold flag pole grabbed a hold of my tongue\n5-0 froze and we all got dumb\n\nOne man's terrorist, another's freedom fighter\nFuture tech molotov cocktails and a lighter\nLegalized gang shit, federal b.i.\nYou wanna buy a weapon, they won't hesitate a second\nWether african, mexican, middle east of haitian\nThey'll slaughter the indigenous and plunder your nation\nPetition the u.n. to gain legal traction\nThen call you the enemy to justify the action\nThe brown in this world is to draw ire\nOf the secret society soul sucking vampire\nEither I come from a long line of liars\nOr a degenerate senator's pants are on fire\nSurround you with walls to protect freedom\nOver-lapping laws to ensure confusion\nProtect your neck in the 2012 season\nThen bounce a check in the bank of illusion\n\nHome grown terrorist, for the benefit\nCan't find a title or a name that truly fits\nThese land jackers, pale face land grabbers\nCaught in a border war, the stench from the border whores\nReal demons, feinin for a real reason\nCan't truss em cause they always fuckin schemin.\nBroke treaty's wit the redman, they said dam\nKlan disqized as fam, fuck uncle sam\nPause for the cause, open the mental doors\nForeign invaders, human traffic traders\nUn-documented worker, want it back\nPanic when the brown man link wit the pro blacks\nWho's the real citizen, have you ever been\nYou raped and robbed every people that ever let you in\nLegalized theft , of the natives land\nSpeak with a fork tongue, rum and gun in hand\nThe I c e,\nWho get's deported and who goes free\nWho get's detained and remains\nWho get's a card and who gets the blame\n",
