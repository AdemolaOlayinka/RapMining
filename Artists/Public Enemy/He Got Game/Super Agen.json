Nuttin.\nYea.\nSold, black gold, one strong buck,\nTo the Milwaukee Bucks, for a million bucks.\nJust get him off the streets so he don't get bucked.\nSuper agent to the rescue so he won't get fucked.\nUh. Run nigga run to the auction block.\nBut you can't pledge alligence to the block.\nThis buck here, is the right kinda stock.\nFor sale for passin, the right kinda rock.\nYo. Auctioneer Stern, to massive fuck.\nCan a nigga go home to where he used to walk?\nCome back, but super agent said, \"You can't talk\"\nI didn't know basketball had a bauk.\nUh the Buck runs laps, while they run craniums.\nPlayers be drainin em, owners be claimin em.\nSuper agents fraimin em and then nicknamin em.\nDrainin they ass, to pack them stadiums.\nSuper agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nSuper agent (What a hell of a man)\n(Where you at?) Super agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nNever flagrant (Big daddy moves).\n(Where you at?) Super agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nSuper agent, (Backstabbin) super agent,\n(Super agent, where are you now?)\nNever flagrant (Watch yo back)\nLet's get it on!!\nThe players ear word for word verbatum.\nSuper agent got him locked. Coaches be hatin him.\nSuper agent wouldn't even come in my hood.\nIf I had no skills, was wackin' no good.\nUh, in my neck of the woods the leagues concrete.\nOne can only dream about wood, yea.\nFeel the grain and let the bills get paid.\nPay respect to the projects,\nAnd the half court rejects.\nScholarships, save that college shit.\nThen championships, don't pay for the head trips.\nCan I get a chance if I don't sing or dance?\nRight about romance? Or wear short pants?\nSo I rave and rant, and you can't say I can't,\nGet my grants, cold chillin in a b-boy stance.\nSuper agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nSuper agent (What a hell of a man)\n(Where you at?) Super agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nNever flagrant (Big daddy moves).\n(Where you at?) Super agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nSuper agent, (Backstabbin) super agent,\n(Super agent, where are you now?)\nNever flagrant (Watch yo back)\nLet's get it on!!\nFuck that trophy, find the loot then approach me.\nLand a milk and honey can I get a quickness to the money?\nAll witness, no cheers the four years I ain't wit this.\nHell wit the N-C-double A cause my super agent's paid.\nWith his dollars I could buy a fuckin' college.\nMister Ra-ra campus isn't keepin school bustas.\nLookin who's lovin' ya, going for the juggeler.\nThey know they can't contain me on the regular.\nPimps pushes, the pocket book guzzeler.\nWould you pardon my father please, Mister Governer?\nThought he had it made, dreamin about a trade.\nThings we get, help but the roof on this bitch.\nDark side of the room when he jumped the broom.\nSuper agent got this player, nine figure wages.\nBack of sports pages, off ghetto stages.\nShootin sleepin pills and runnin to the hills.\nSuper agent (Super agent, where are you now?)\nSuper agent (What a hell of a man)\n(Where you at?)
