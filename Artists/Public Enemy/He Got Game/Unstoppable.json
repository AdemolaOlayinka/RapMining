Hell yea\nLet me take you elsewhere, where you stand, there's a curse there\nfor sure, unless you're mature, grow up\nIf you're immature, then you're livin sinister\nYou reject the words of the minister\nYou better get witcha Qu'Ran or bible, you won't be livin long\nif you're livin idol, the t'cha, that's my title\nShakin it up, wakin it up, makin it up, breakin it up\nTakin it up higher, no liar, you can't deny the\nPublic Enemy, with the public enema\nI gets way up in your buttocks, I rocks cause it's hip-hop\nThe long-laster, Chuck D with BlastMurderer\nI know you heard of the word I be swervin and servin ya\nAlertin ya, while splurtin a divine speech\nSlow the party down so I can spit it\nTo each I teach mystic lyric, don't stop, you can get it\nYou better hear it.. battle? Quit it!\nUnstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc\nUnstoppable\nRunnin the game, Chuck and Kris\nUnstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip\nUnstoppable\nYou don't wanna take this risk\nUnstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc\nUnstoppable\nYou don't wanna take the risk!\n\nCan the black hear his stepchild, run the mile\nForever like a juvenile, to stay alive\nSurvivin in the freestyle, yo hold it down\nWalkin on the wild side, to live or die\nDamn another slow song\nYo Money put the recrod back the FUCK on\nNo respect for the Usual Suspects, mad teens\npourin fire on the gasoline, defeat fiends\nFeelin like fever, I'm gettin warm\nChalk marks in the rainstorm, children of the gone\nlost and forgotten, minds rotten\nThe arcade shot em, Channel Zero on the TV got em\nIf you don't love yourself you can't love nobody\nIf you don't know yourself, then you nobody\nDo your thing, no bang, in the same damn gang\nI never sang, I'm back, but I transmit slang\nSilence in the face of violent crews\nMy rhymes and news be blacker than most blues\nTroublein, it all come tumblein, for the strugglin\noccupations, daily operations stimulations\ncausin mental violations, minds on vacation\nIn the middle of Revelation is a nation\nUnstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc\nUnstoppable\nRunnin the game, Chuck and Kris\nUnstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip\nUnstoppable\nYou don't wanna take the risk!\nUnstoppable, Public Enemy on a disc\nUnstoppable\nRunnin the game, Chuck and Kris\nUnstoppable, bet you didn't know they had grip\nUnstoppable\nYou don't wanna take the risk!\nUnstoppable\n",
