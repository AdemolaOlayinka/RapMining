    "lyrics": "I got a letter from the government\nThe other day\nI opened and read it\nIt said they were suckers\nThey wanted me for their army or whatever\nPicture me given' a damn - I said never\nHere is a land that never gave a damn\nAbout a brother like me and myself\nBecause they never did\nI wasn't wit' it, but just that very minute...\nIt occured to me\nThe suckers had authority\nCold sweatin' as I dwell in my cell\nHow long has it been?\nThey got me sittin' in the state pen\nI gotta get out - but that thought was thought before\nI contemplated a plan on the cell floor\nI'm not a fugitive on the run\nBut a brother like me begun - to be another one\nPublic enemy servin' time - they drew the line y'all\nTo criticize me some crime - never the less\nThey could not understand that I'm a Black man\nAnd I could never be a veteran\nOn the strength, the situation's unreal\nI got a raw deal, so I'm goin' for the steel\nThey got me rottin' in the time that I'm servin'\nTellin' you what happened the same time they're throwin'\n4 of us packed in a cell like slaves - oh well\nThe same motherfucker got us livin' is his hell\nYou have to realize - what its a form of slavery\nOrganized under a swarm of devils\nStraight up - word'em up on the level\nThe reasons are several, most of them federal\nHere is my plan anyway and I say\nI got gusto, but only some I can trust - yo\nSome do a bid from 1 to 10\nAnd I never did, and plus I never been\nI'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall\nCell block and locked - I never clock it y'all\n'Cause time and time again time\nThey got me servin' to those and to them\nI'm not a citizen\nBut ever when I catch a C-O\nSleepin' on the job - my plan is on go-ahead\nOn the strength, I'ma tell you the deal\nI got nothin' to lose\n'Cause I'm goin' for the steel\nYou know I caught a C-O\nFallin' asleep on death row\nI grabbed his gun - then he did what I said so\nAnd everyman's got served\nAlong with the time they served\nDecency was deserved\nTo understand my demands\nI gave a warnin' - I wanted the governor, y'all\nAnd plus the warden to know\nThat I was innocent -\nBecause I'm militant\nPosing a threat, you bet it's fuckin' up the government\nMy plan said I had to get out and break north\nJust like with Oliver's neck\nI had to get off - my boys had the feds in check\nThey couldn't do nuthin'\nWe had a force to instigate a prison riot\nThis is what it takes for peace\nSo I just took the piece\nBlack for Black inside time to cut the leash\nFreedom to get out - to the ghetto - no sell out\n6 C-Os we got we ought to put their head out\nBut I'll give 'em a chance, cause I'm civilized\nAs for the rest of the world, they can't realize\nA cell is hell - I'm a rebel so I rebel\nBetween bars, got me thinkin' like an animal\nGot a woman C-O to call me a copter\nShe tried to get away, and I popped her\nTwice, right\nNow who wanna get nice?\nI had 6 C-Os, now it's 5 to go\nAnd I'm serious - call me delirious\nBut I'm still a captive\nI gotta rap this\nTime to break as time grows intense\nI got the steel in my right hand\nNow I'm lookin' for the fence\nI ventured into the courtyard\nFollowed by 52 brothers\nBruised, battered, and scarred but hard\nGoin' out with a bang\nReady to bang out\nBut power from the sky\nAnd from the tower shots rang out\nA high number of dose - yes\nAnd some came close\nFigure I trigger my steel\nStand and hold my post\nThis is what I mean - an anti-nigger machine\nIf I come out alive and then they won't - come clean\nAnd then I threw up my steel bullets - flew up\nBlew up, who shot...\nWhat, who, the bazooka was who\nAnd to my rescue, it was the S1Ws\nSecured my getaway, so I just gotaway\nThe joint broke, from the black smoke\nThen they saw it was rougher thatn the average bluffer\n'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact\nNow the chase is on tellin' you to c'mon\n53 brothers on the run, and we are gone\n",
