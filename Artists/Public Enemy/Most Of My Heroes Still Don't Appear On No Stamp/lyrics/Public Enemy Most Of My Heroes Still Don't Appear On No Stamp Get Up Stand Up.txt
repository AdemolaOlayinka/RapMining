Public Enemy
Most Of My Heroes Still Don't Appear On No Stamp
2012)
This song don't give a damn 
If the rhymes don't fit
Beat don't bounce 
If the dj quit
This song
Don't give a damn
If you can't sing to dance to it
Can't romance to it
This song ain't arrogant 
If you don't try it
Buy it
If your radio deny it
Don't care bout what who got
What's cool on tv
Or what spots hot I forgot
I ain't mad at evolution
But I stand for revolution 
Enough is enough
Somebody stand up 
Get up, stand up, 
Get up, stand up 

This track ain't asking you a damn thing
Not the brand name bottle with your champagne 
Not where you land your private airplane
How many blood diamonds shining in that chain?
How much compromise is tied to that fame?
How many more times we gotta hear that lame
Line I'm inspiring them
To do what? roll better weed and get higher than them?
Feed the needy greedy ass fire in them?
Be the same damn dog but to finer women?
They gonna tell me that I'm preaching to the choir than I'm
Sure they right but I'm trying to light a fire in them
Cause I was raised by the enemy
And ever since then thats been my identity
So I'm trying to give back whats was given me
Truth told delivery is my tendency
Youth fold to the spirit of my energy
Bottom of my feet is something that you'll never see
Thats cause I'm standing singing the anthem
Fist on my hand, and a list of demands and
When they hear this might piss in their pants and
Try to get the children to not listen to the man 
But the mighty pe is what birthed ali
So what you gonna think come after me?
Chuck d 
Get up, stand up 

Occupy if you denied
Protest songs cause I see wrong
Most of my heroes still don't appear on no stamp
So I rant even when they say I can't 
I rise against
Rage against
Hope I don't end up being the same thing I'm fighting against
Hence
I wince never on the fence
Since they think the masses powerless
Ain't on no power list 
I ball my fist w my audience
Like this
Get up, stand up, 
Get up, stand up 

Got so much to shout about
What the 1% is gettin out
Recession depression desperation due
Never have so many been screwed by so few
Cheapest price is to pay attention
No need to dumb down to what I mention
No need to young down how I mention 
In spanish portuguese english french and
No satisfaction 
Listen to the world reaction
Americas still black and white
Like an old tv set
What we gonna do about it?
Laugh sit back forget & quit?
I get racial
Just talkin about the ratio
People are no longer patient
Now the brown they don't want around
Thats why sammy got that facial
My wife says its spacial
Politics that stick way beyond baseball
I think its self hateful
Anti immigration
Disgraceful 
Get up, stand up,
