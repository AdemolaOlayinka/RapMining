Power to the people
Cause the people want peace
Have no fear
You're safe right here
You are protected 
You are respected
The people gotta voice
The people gotta choice
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
A fool believes.....

Who the government?
Who the terrorists?
Where the hit list?
Pump the raised fist
Make em spread the wealth
As long as you got your health
Cause I know I cant get no help
So I jump back and kiss myself
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
A fool believes......

Swear to god
You thought the yard was hard
Come get your god with a credit card
Preacher lyin on the truth to raise his roof
Cmon holla preacher flow got yo dollar
Devil succeeded in never 
Givin you what you needed
Playin with religion
So the people believe it
They playin with god
While preyin on god
While you prayin to god
They playin with god
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
The who, the when, the why, the what
A fool believes.......
