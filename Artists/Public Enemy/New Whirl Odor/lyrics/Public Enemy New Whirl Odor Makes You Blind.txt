Rap like hell make it sould like heaven

Black supermen is back as your hero
Here ye , here yo
America the beautiful
Beatiful, the plentiful
Now lookin sorta pitiful
A third of the world at war
Wait a minute
Gotta take care of the rock if yall wanna live in it
Medicine and medicare
Cause they dont care
Your favorite millionare
Is high up in the air
See em every where
But they aint there
So rally and protest against the world in fear
People people
Can we take it to the square
You dont matter
And they dont mind
These be the things that
Makes ya blind


Uh pimp or preach
Same thing
Nuttin worse 
Than a new black church
Lyin on the truth
Cause it hurts
Black man came first
In the sweet name of jesus
Cost me a dollar
At the flow of creflo
Like how the hell he supposed to know

I see they ass

Runnin to the radio
And the tv issues and views
Shaped by one sided news
Got us like 
Planet of the apes
Under cds and tapes
Preachy
Young cats askin ol heads 
Teach me
Over beats that reach me
Radiation of a radio tv movie nation on your gdamn mind
Makes ya blind

You dont matter
And they dont mind
These be the things that
Makes ya blind


Now yall keep on bouncin to
What i said
These are the facts that gonna blow your head
Yall know what i said 
When i say no to thugs
Thug life runs at the top
And yall thought it was pac
These government gangsters
Makin robots
Who forgot
Hypnotic in a 
2000 by 3000 mile box
35 year olds lost in a x box

Playstation and videos

So thats how it goes

World begins and ends at the tip of your nose
It aint eminem
Its m & m & m
Mcdonalds mtv and microsoft
Cant you see they 
Got the young strung at a cost

Yes that treacherous 3 go off, go off

You dont matter
And they dont mind
And these be the things that
Makes ya blind


So i pray to god
Life and health
Feel like i got a church in myself
So i jump back and kiss myself
Cutbacks lookout
Cant get no help
Hands in the air
Bush and blair dont care
While the unaware, 
They just stare

This nation said screw the organization
Of the united nations
Cross tv stations
And they sent to the masses
They consider them asses

Take a look at the world
Another son of a bush disaster
Do the math
Cause the loudest they comin after
These same cats who wiped out half of africa
And you dont know the half 
Have nots robbed by the haves
Signin new money like signin autographs
Mcdonalds billions sold
America billions told
Houston we have a problem
Isnt this a bitch
When i wanna hear blues
I turn on the news
See the rich get richer
And the poor keep bitchin
Buckle down
Knuckle up
When times is rough

You dont matter
And they dont mind
These be the things that
Makes ya blind
