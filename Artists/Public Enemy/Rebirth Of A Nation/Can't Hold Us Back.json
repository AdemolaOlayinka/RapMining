    "lyrics": "Today we are together, we are unified and on runnin' cower\nWhen we are together we got power\nThat is why we gathered today, celebratin' our own....\n\nWe spit flows on foes\nListen to the message that you never know\nGot a plan for the man and it's federal\nThe rhyme animal, back to play the part again\nClear the madness, and put the message in\nD, the Enemy is back to rip the mic\nWe come together, so don't believe the hype\nCheck my tone, there's a war here at home\nWe united and strong, and never move alone\n\nWe rep justice, equality and freedom now\nPut fam first, man, woman and child\nNever mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise\nWhere we say, what we mean and we mean what we say\nIt's been a long time comin' that we mob as one\nGuerrilla Funk, Hard Truth nigga, that's what's up\nNo peace on the street 'til the justice come\nFrom the ballot to the bullet, if it's on, it's on\n\nI ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nSee, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nBelieve, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nMy brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nThat's real talk on the one\n\nYo, yo, yo, yo, I'm a target, I got proof\nMy buildin' got an 'X' on it\nBloomberg threw the hex on it\nIt's like a pistol with effects on it\nOn a nigga with arrest warrants\nHittin' pigs in their chests Quadrant where they vest wasn't\nNow he dead cousin\nAll you snitches hit the red buttons, we some Uncle-Tom killers\nMini-nina concealers, political cap-peelers for this freedom for rilla\n\nYo, if police stop the whip you got to eat them trees\nI ain't got no 'G' to give it to them crackers and court fees\nYou know my steez, security first, prepare for the worst\nNever caught slippin' if you stay on alert\nMalcolm X said send them to the cemetery if they touch you\nA revolutionary virtue, a dull blade'll hurt you\nI'm up early workin' my machete\nIn war, it ain't no warning, you just got to be ready\n\nI ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nMy nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nMy nigga, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nYou see, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me, yeah, uha\n\nYeah, my nigga it's bigger than rap\nYou really think you gon' be left alone\nOn sayin' that you believe and ain't gon' have to get your scrap on?\nThen yap on, and will see if that's the right route\nWhile I get my clap on and turn niggas' lights out\nI tried to be nice, now we gon' have to bleed them\nI'm willin' to do a killin' for the price of freedom \"that's right\"\nComin' from the left, nigga, hood is how we kept it \"right\"\nSo prison or death is just somethin' I done accepted\nSo we'll murder a snake, and we'll kill a skunk \"that's right\"\nThis ain't the word of a fake, it's Guerrilla Funk\nSo right now is the time and you turf the location\nY'all about to see the Rebirth Of a Nation\nEven if some got de-rebelized\nThe revolution still will not be televised\nU.S. Government tellin' hell of lies\nAnd it's evident, when you look in this president's devil eyes\n\nI ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nYeah, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nNo homie, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\nMy brother, I ain't lettin' nothin' hold me back or block me\nThey gon' have to pop me to stop me\n\nThat's real talk on the one\n\nThat is why, I challenged you now\nTo stand together, raise your fists together\nAnd engage in our national black messiness\nDo it courage and determination..\nI AM, \"I AM\" - SOMEBODY \"SOMEBODY\"\nI AM, \"I AM\" - SOMEBODY \"SOMEBODY\"\nI LIVE IN POOR \"I LIVE IN POOR\"\nBUT I AM, \"BUT I AM\" SOMEBODY \"SOMEBODY\"\nI NEED YOUR WELFARE \"I NEED YOUR WELFARE\"\nBUT I AM, \"I AM\" SOMEBODY \"SOMEBODY\"\nI'm MAYBE YOUR SEAL \"I'M MAYBE YOUR SEAL\"\nBUT I AM, \"BUT I AM\" SOMEBODY \"SOMEBODY\"\nI AM \"I AM\" BLACK \"BLACK\" BEAUTIFUL \"BEAUTIFUL\" RAW \"RAW\"\nI MUST BE EFFECTIVE \"I MUST BE EFFECTIVE\"\nI MUST BE PROTECTED \" I MUST BE PROTECTED\"\nWHAT TIME IS IT? \"UNIFICATION\"\nWHEN WE STAND TOGETHER, WHAT TIME IS IT?\nWHEN WE SAY NO MORE ?? WHAT TIME IS IT?\nWHAT TIME IS IT?\nWHAT TIME IS IT?\n",
