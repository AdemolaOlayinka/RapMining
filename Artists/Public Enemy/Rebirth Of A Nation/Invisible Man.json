    "lyrics": "I came from a place I forgot\nI woke up in the parking lot, far from a meal and a cot\nOn the corner where all the streets got the same name\nMaybe my brain's on the brink of (INSANE!)\nPain between the papers while sleepin on the train\nThis the land of milk and honey (know what I'm sayin?!)\nThe invisible man times three\nBlack, down and out - out standin on a corner (no doubt)\nNow a nation of homeless sleepin in bus stations\nAnother win for the pilgrims who said (NO MORE HAITIANS)\nAs I proceed, someone to feed me is what I need\n(Three blocks of dealers tryin to hit me off with some weed)\nYeah, avenues and boulevards hungry as a (FUCKER)\nHope to get a ride from a (TRUCKER - aiyyo man)\nEverybody know I ain't no (SUCKER)\nEvery time I used to drop thirty at the (RUCKER - that's it)\nAway from the crazy kids in Generation Wrecked\nDissin pyramids while praisin projects\n(Walk past old folks gettin no respect!)\nCallin young folks a bunch a no-good rejects\nAnd I walk on\n\n\nAn eye for an eye, I can't recognize the man in the mirror\nIs it I? It is I\nNow who this cat I'm lookin at?\nCause I've been waitin so long, to get where I'm goin\nAn eye for a eye, in this country 'tis of thee\nNow how the hell, can I be free\nAnd who this cat I'm lookin at?\nCause I've been lost so long without anybody knowin\n\n\nSo I move on (uh-huh) and I walk on (yeah-yeah!)\nPast the preachers and the pimps gettin their talk on (SAY WORD?!)\nWhy do home gotta be where the negative roam\nTo be or not to be (so I roll alone)\nI'm trapped within, this skin and these bones\nAmongst temporary kings, on cellular phones\nCan I last, as I walk past\nMad cigarette billboards, and malt liquor ads\n(Walkin on da bottles and potato chip bags)\nEveryone I see got the nerve to brag\nWhere they from, what they got, and don't own squat\nDisrespect where they from and you might get shot\nZombies askin me, what the latest bomb be\n(You shoulda shot the fuckin sheriff and the fuckin deputy G!)\nFor okayin the drug trade and lettin it be\nBut I know prison for me, is an industry\nSo I walk, heard the best things in life be free\n(Didn't God make this land and the air that we breathe)\nNot for the homeless, don't give a damn about me\nIn the mirror somebody else is starin at me\nMaybe prison is the skin I'm within\nAll this time I been sufferin can't fix it with a Bufferin\nPlus they said I'll never work in this town again (God damn!)\nSo I keep on walkin - yeah\n\n\n\n\nLil' DayDay is Big Day and just did time\nSeen him standin (on the unemployment line?!)\nWhich collided with the line of the health clinic\nI seen Crazy Stacy, her ass standin up in it\nNo more welfare, they cut her Medicaid\n(DAMN! My momma used to do her braids)\nI keep walkin, so they don't see me\nBut I doubt if they doin much better than me\nSo I walk on, never take the planet for granted\nI paved the concrete, asphalt and granite\nI walked past three brothers, sittin on the porch\nWith a yard of dirt, and littered with Newports\nTalkin how they comin up while they sittin on they ass\nAs I walk past 'em I'm the target of they laughs\nAnd one said \"Let's get him for his fuckin stash\"\nAs I walked fast, past the other yards with grass\nHad a little cash, I tried to make it last\nFrom a few deals I made from cleanin windshields\nI ran like a (rally) they caught me in the (alley)\nCan't get out the ghetto from New York to (Cali)\nI thought I had nothin, 'til I felt the knife\nAnd now I ain't even got a life...\n",
