We need a change..\"\n\n\"One of these motherfuckers different\"\n\nBringing you back what you miss in hip-hop\nHard truth sol-sol-sol-sol-sol-sol-soldier radio\nWord! \"Pay attention real close, we just begun\"\n\n\nYeah! Immortal Technique, part of the rebel militia\nWeapon I brandish, don't need the canvas to paint a picture\nFuck who you askin, I'll tell you what it is\nIt ain't music motherfucker it's the way that we live\nParty crashin, leavin the door with a broke lock\nAnd make a toast to the cancer of Rupert Murdoch\nI got a hit, on the Grand Wizard and the cyclops\nAnd I'll be snipin, campus security bike cops\nFuck around, and I'ma start blastin they kids\nPayback, for what they did to John Africa's crib\nThese pigs talk a lot of shit, shit, wavin the badge\nCan put it down and go the fuck home wrapped in a flag\nI have nothin but, empty shells for enemies\nStrike me down, that'll give birth to ten of me\nForbidden chemistry, my verse is the dirty bomb\nUrban combat, next year nigga it's on\n",
