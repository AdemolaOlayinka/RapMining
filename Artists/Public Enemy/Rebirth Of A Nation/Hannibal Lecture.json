    "lyrics": "Being here in America doesn't make you an American\nBeing born here in America doesn't make you an American\nWhy if birth made you an American you wouldn't need any legislation\nYou wouldn't need any amendments to the Constitution\nI don't see any American dream, I see an American nightmare\nI'm one of the 42 million black people who are the victims of America\n\n\nAiyyo we all in together now, all in together now\nHard truth soldierin, hard truth soldier SHIT\nKeep on servin 'em, cause you know we do work\nMashin in my Chevy down the streets of New York, they feel me\nI smooth grip, and hit up the spot\nSnatch Flav as my dual pipes burn up the block\nWe bumpin hardcore, heavyweight, b-boy blast\nOn the street they hear my beat, my 69 is fast\nSmash down Lennox, head up to the 'View\nSome reporter wanna holla and I said it was cool\nWanna know about the album and the Enemy's new\nHow P.E. and Guerilla Funk is keepin it movin\nBreakin bread talkin politics, you know how it go\n'Bout the war and how it's shitty that we murder for dough\nThen the reporter asked a question, that I had to mash\nHow, I would act if every day was maybe my last\nHow if every day I worried 'bout my family in this\nI'd be murdered on these street in a puddle of piss\nOr if I would get some news that my brother had died\nIf they ran up in my house and held my kids and my wife\nOr if we was looted and somebody took all our thangs\nIf my sister was abducted, never heard from again\nI began to compare it, so he could observe\nWhen I made the parallels with how they livin abroad\nI can't ignore it, these pigs ride deep in the streets\nCap a nigga for his wallet, beat another for free\nAnd the cold part about it, life is cheaper than that\nDown there people on the bottom kill each other for scraps\nImagine that, propoganda got the people confused\nDamned by the media that keep 'em subdued\nI been around the world, seen a lot of shit in my life\nSame sirens, same ghetto birds swirlin at night\nSame racism, profilin each of us all\nSame outsiders where we live enforcin the law\nGats clappin on the streets, gunplayin with heat\nSame prisons full of brothers herded in like sheep\nSame turncoats that'll burn folks for pay\nSame conditions in communities we die everyday\nSame brutality and ignorance, now what will it take\nto break the motherfuckin cycle, get the people away?\nThat's why I'm fresh out of tears for 'em, all out of tears for 'em\nEven though my heart goes out, what the fuck you cryin 'bout?\nMoney for rebuilding but, what about home?\nWhen the way we live is shitty where's the love for our own?\nI can't decide it, it's real, I hit you with proof\nMaybe I'll be suicided cause I hit you with truth\nSee they kill for less than what we say on records to you\nHear the message in the music from a rebel to you, now listen\n\n\nSave my life you gotta, save my life you gotta\nSave us, save us\n",
