    "lyrics": "Yeah that's right Chuck man, that's what you gotta do\nYou got to tell 'em JUST LIKE THAT, you know what I'm sayin?\nCause yo, man let me tell you a little somethin man\nAll these brothers around here fiendin for that crack-a-lack-a-lack\nYou dig what I'm sayin? Yo man, all they wanna do is get what you got\nBut when you ain't got nuttin, then they wanna cut you off\nSo what you gotta do, you gotta play 'em long distance\nYou know what I'm sayin? I mean long distance\nThey think we takin shorts, show 'em this is Cold Medina man\nC'mon, kick it!\n\n\nBack one more time, here to put the message in a rough rhyme\nIt's important that you knowin the time\nCause I'm seein the program, know what I know and\nuntil we get together we will never be up for sure\nSo I wreck like I'm posessed by Malcolm X\nSee the feds want us dead, we too complex\nI always speak the truth, comin from me to you\nWe movin as a unit so you KNOW we refuse to lose\nI got my eyes on the lies from Washington\nI'm a survivor, I know how the West was won\nSee a show and tell, the way the CoIntel\nundermind the REAL hip-hop so the cops can trail\nBut know bad boys move in silence\nSave us all from the pain of a life of violence\nThey tappin my phone, full grown and knowin\nAnd still prone to refute the lies, won't stop until we rise\n\n\nRise up! \"C'mon, ah-c'mon\"\nRise... rise up! \"One more time\"\nWe rise... rise up! \"C'mon, ah-c'mon\"\nRise... rise up! \"To the beat y'all\"\n\n\nI'm a hard truth soldier to the bone for change\nDemonstrate and seperate the fact from strange\nBlame companies killin our children\nWhen the villain's on the record never think for a second that's the way we live\nWanna squeeze on the fleas at MTV\nWe quiz knots for the cops at BET\nSeize the time, always rhymin combinin the antidote\nfor dope Interscope and fake gangster quotes\nCause I can recollect times when records set\nCollect a dead brother you mind if you silence it yet\nRest the program, defeat the beastie\nCause on the street they do as we influenced by what we see\nAnd yes it \"Weighs a Ton\" I say it once again\nThat's why the Enemy is down with Paris and KAM\nIt's all fam, we collide we live\nBetter decide on which side you ride, won't stop until we rise\n\n\n\n\nY'all don't know, y'all don't know uhh\n\n\nI know the power of fame, ain't never playin no games\nNever croonin is provin, that we ready for change\nNever simpin but they pimpin my people, for the dollars\nSo I holla back it keep us from EVIL 'til them devils are collared\nAnd like I said it's on, I say it once again\nBetter know the plan to keep us ignorant\nBrother to brother, ain't no other can smother\nOr erase my case, we marry words with BASS\nJust another wicked rhyme that I'm rappin on\nS1's got my back if the clappin come\nPass on the work, makin sure the words are known\nKeep 'em nervous, make 'em understand we servin foes\nKeep it goin strong, nevertheless, know the enemy\nAnd never back down, you can take it to press\n'Less the mic like the art dart told you before\nWe for the prize emphasis the fight, now c'mon and rise\n",
