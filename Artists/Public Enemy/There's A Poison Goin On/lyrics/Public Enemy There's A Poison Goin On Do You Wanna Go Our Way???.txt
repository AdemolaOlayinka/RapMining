Public Enemy
There's A Poison Goin On
1999)
Now what sound of my DJ cuts
Terminator's back on some ol' fools track
Takes a nation of sellouts to keep us back
Flippin disco raps used to be whack
Now what you hear is what you lack
Take a lil bit of this a lil bit of dat
Who dropped the bomb on hip hop
Who got biggie and who shot tupac
What's forgot / ain't no eazy, no scott larock
Now what's rap gotta do wit what you got
For whom the bell tolls
Is that the way the story goes
85% believing all the videos
God knows / who controls the radios
Some people chose the road to be hoes
And so i rose / in the middle of all the woes
And def jam / negroes turnin up their nose
There's one way in no way out
No doubt the body count
Gettin headz checkin out
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Time to make life shine again like glass
Gotta make it shine like glass
Outraged against the scene
Proofread the script
Flipped it back so I'm back in gang green
We interrupt this routine I had a dream
Da clean protein smacked the gangsta lean
Between the triple team
Wiped em out like a drought
Damn I'm raps tetracycline
Them lips foretold these apocalypse
Everything had a shot
And got hit wit bullshit
Twisted politics tricks I couldn't get wit
As one quits another nitwit hits
All the way crazy, shady
World turned upside down
I put it down
Why destroy what you love
Look around
Surrounded by chalk marks on the ground
Where the lost got found
Why it all come tumblin down
Why he and she gotta die
Now how dat sound
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
On & on to the break a dawn
Some the 100 meter dash I'm the marathon
Been around a long time
But the rhyme the same
Sound remains insane
Exchange the reign
Ain't that somethin
Figure I smashed the pumpkin
So I parallel the brains of cobain
Show no shame like the pain of kane
Gettin madd opposition hip to the game
It's that gran ol' pe ammo
Different time different channel
Funky piano
Here to witness get on up with a quickness
S1's in the house
Wit the thickness that get dis
1 2 3 4 5 attackin they frat
Griff is back got 5 on it black
The track got x on the decks
Terminators back cause a dat is whack
On the 1 and 2
Yeah go flavor
Pe hit the road gettin set to explode
Fight the power for peace
Can't forget the war mode
Overload
There she blows
Here we go
Now you know
Damn another alamo
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
Do you wanna go our way
This the way we puttin this down
