I ain't understanding\nWhat's better to understand then be misunderstood?\nCos the FBI is up to no good\nPower to the peeps who come with their own drum\nAnd don't end up like sheep\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\nMad heads confused by the isms\nBustin caps incoginisms\nPhone taps, makin sure they record ya\nFrom my midnight plane to Georgia, uhh\nAncient to\u00a0 player\nThe life giver, the name take-awayer\nPropaganda can't gasp the last man standing\nAssassinate all the plannin\nGet wreck, what you see is what you get\nTo plunder more stars than Trek\n21st Century Robin Hood\nI guess the politics are robbin hoods\nFuck the Government 'cause you know that I would\nCos the FBI is up to no good\nPower to the peeps who come with their own drum\nAnd don't end up like sheep\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\nBe a bitch is a foreign crime\nEngine, Engine Number 9\nEngineerin monopolies, triggers and uninsured jalopy's\nCatchin more lock than companies\nEngineerin opinion and policies\nHerd following like sheep\nFollowing of the sheep will be sheep\nbased on what they heard from their peeps, uhh\nAble to straddle quick beats without a battle\nPolitician assassinated\nRappers get shot, quote Chris Rock\n\"To have, to have not\" is the question\nYes, them 'have nots' be robots\nAll the sheeps have forgot\nThe 'haves' keep the 'have nots' guessin\nunder them Smith & Wessons\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n(Kill!)\n(Kill Em Live!)\n",
