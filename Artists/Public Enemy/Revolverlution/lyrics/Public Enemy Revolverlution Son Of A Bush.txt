Oh no
Struck by greased lightning
F'ed by the same last name, you know what?
China ain't never givin back that gottdamn plane
Must got this ol nation trained
On some kennel ration
Refrain
The same train
Fulla cocaine
Froze the brain
Have you forgotten
I been thru the first term of rotten
The father, the son
And the holy bush-it we all in
Don't look at me 
I ain't callin for no assassination
I'm just sayin/ sayin who voted for this asshole of the nation
Deja bush
Crushed by the head rush
15 years back
When I wrote the first bum rush
Saw you salute
To the then
Vice prez 
Who did what raygun said
And then became prez
Himself went for delf
Knee deep in his damn self 
Stuck in a 3 headed bucket
Of trilateral bush-it
Sorry ain't no better way of puttin it
No you cannot freestyle this
Cause yo ass still ain't free
If I fight for yall
And they get me
How many of yall
Is comin to get me?
None
Cause its easier to forget me
Ain't that a bush
Son of a bush is here
All up in your zone
You ain't never heard so much soul to the bone
I told yall when the first bush was tappin my phone
Spy vs spy
Cant truss em
As you salute to the illuminati
Take your ass to your 1 millionth party
Hes the son of a baaad 
Hes the son of a bad man
Now heres the pitch
High and inside
Certified genocide 
Ain't that a bush repeat ain't that a bush
Out of nowhere
Headed to the hothouse?
Killed 135 at the last count...texas bounce
Cats in the cage
Got a ghost of a chance
Of comin back
From your whack ass killin machine
Son of a bush ain't that a son of a bush
Cats doin bids 
For doin the same bush shit that you did
Serial killer kid uh serial killer kid
Hes the son of a baaad 
Hes the son of a bad man
Coke it's the real thing 
Used to make you swing
Used to be your thing 
Daddy had you under his wing
Bringin kilos to fill up silos
You probably sniffed piles
Got inmates in texas scrubbin tiles
That shit is wild
Cia child
