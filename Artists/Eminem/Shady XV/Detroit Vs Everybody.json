static\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\nI took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree\nAll these females need to email to make noise\nAnd now things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority\nThen he shall sea shells, but not by the seashore\nIf he gang bangin' or not\nIt's simple as the alphabet\nHe F with me, that G shall surely see\nHe definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's sweet\nThe honest gesture\nThe trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tell flaw with heat\nThe same soldier, it's me, myself and I\nRidin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography\nRange Rover, this ain't the squash beef state\nYou thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face\nThe Twin Eagles ol' air his coup might as well ride by in the ambulance\nMy pair ol' shoot like sky divin' in Hammer pants\nSo call it siblin\u043f rivalry\nTake his life, call it the unforgivable robbery\nA wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like\nLettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free\nReal talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns\nY'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea\n(That's Nickel) Ridin' around this block\nAll we knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop\n(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?\n\nShawn Don\n(Welcome to Detroit)\nBoy I need no half's a half, I want the game in entirety\nHundred percent cut, no stitches required\nWelcome to Detroit where is you get that promotion\nDon't worry, man those bullets will still be at your ass firin'\nI still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpiring\nBoy hit the beat & just treat that shit like it's a diary\nI'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me\nSelf made, I've never needed your bail or a wire, see\nI'm never callin' collect, I call to collect\nMy homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in a vet\nHa plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boys, is all that I fetch\nIf the the ball in my hand then the ball in the net\nBitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me\nI'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me\nI'm over respected, my mama gated community's over protective\nSo futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch\nReminiscin' all listening to 50 fifty times a day\nBack when tenth grade was like 50 days away\nTryin' to get paid 50 ways a day\nUsed to put 50 on the layaway, now my closet 50 shades of grey\nTwenty six and I done lived a life time a few times\nFrom futons to Grey Poupon's\nIn church tryin' to get a little savings, yeah coupon\nI spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes\nNow the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines\nTakin' down my number like \"you still ain't got a new line?\"\nNaw it's the same, we been laborin' for years\nI know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time\nI turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though\nDon't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral\nWhen you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful\nThis is just part one, wait 'til the sequel\n\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little static\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\nComin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat\nJust a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D\nArguably the whole reason for all of this honesty\nHonestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets\nCause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya\nPut a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River\nIf you think your hood harder then I might beg to differ\nKnow some killas pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller\nIf the blicka hit ya kisser, bet yo ass not remembering\nThey say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'\nSo nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman\nHad K's in front ya school, but I ain't going to Ketteran\nCough up a lung, 313 where I'm from\nGhan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son\nAny nigga try to copy, put a hole in his top\nIt's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody\n\nLately it seems as if it's me against the world\nLike it was before my life became a movie\nAnd they used to use my mother fuckin' trailer to tease me with\nBut I flipped that script like a refilla a\nPainkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal\nIt made me feel amazing, navy seal of bravery\nAnd if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script\nAin't bein' conceited\nBut I made it to radio, eat a dick\nI still never ABC'D the shit\nMainstream appeal but the skill is what made me iller\nSince before they called Jay Dee Dilla\nI was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit\nAnd if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here\nStill in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real\nDon't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler\nBreak all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer\nPeel off back to the same block that we came from, on a rampage to crazy?\nFor me to flip\nWhat's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson\nWhen he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid\nOn the track get spanked like he just did\n(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch\nSick of bein' treated like me and shit\nBut Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features\nAnd them cyphers on BET cause if\nI wasn't me, I probably wouldn't wanna play with me neither, shit\nSeems to be reachin' it's fever pitch\nOne hundred and eighty degrees in here\nShoulder blade full of cedar chips\nMC's just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish\nOr Lorena with a two penises\nHateful and genius ness, inconvenience\nAnd for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life\nWhen I'm makin' you cling\nMay consider tryin' to reinsulate ya windows may be in or another crazy winter\nCause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away\nBut ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blond\nBut ain't we sick of bein' underdogs\nDon't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit\nMay even seem as if\nI'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit\nIs playin' with ya\nAnd it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer\nSince the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter\nWith the potato peeler mushed her face into the entertainment center\nIt's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again\nThe Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safe descent\nAwaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger\nDid you make arrangements with the gangsters 'for you came here?\nAnd if they mention\n\nTell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static\nI swear I love my city, I just want a little static\nSee me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static\nDetroit vs. Everybody\n\nWhat up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'.\nDetroit!\nOkay!\n",
