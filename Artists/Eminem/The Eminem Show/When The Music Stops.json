    "lyrics": "Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference\nBut we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids\nSike!\n\n\nIf I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow\nWould you feel sorrow or show love\nOr would it matter\nCan never be the lead-off batter of things\nShit for me to feed off\nI'm see-saw battling\nBut theres way too much at stake for me to be fake\nThere's too much on my plate\nAnd I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away\nAnd not say what I got to say\nWhat the fuck you take me for? a joke? you smoking crack?\nBefore I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back\nI get up 'for I get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out\nI'm trying-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark\nYou all steady trying to drown the shark\nAin't gonna do nothing but piss me off\nLid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off\nSee me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out\nFuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle\nTalk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap\nYou're slim, you're gonna let him get away with that?\nHe tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that\nMan I hate this crap, this ain't rap,\nThis is crazy the way we act\nWhen we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops\n\n\nThere ain't no getting rid of McVeigh\nIf so you would've tried\nThe only way I'm leaving this bitch is suicide\nI have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessey,\nGot drunk then I finished he\nI'm every niggas favorite arch-enemy.\nPhysically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef\nI spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently\nI'm not what you think\nI appear to be fucked up\nMentally endangered\nI can't stay away from a razor\nI just want my face in a paper\nI wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres\nI murder you\nDanger had me turned into a mad man, son of Sam, bitch, I'm surgical\nI'll allergic to dying, you think not? you got balls? We can see how large\nWhen the music stops\n\n\nI was happy having a deal at first,\nThought money would make me happy but\nIt only made my pain worst,\nIt hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg\nWhen you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls\nAnd you're stressed from the calls of your new friends\nBeggin' with they hands out\nChecking for your record when its selling\nWhen it ain't, that's the end, no laughs\nNo friends no girl\nJust the gin you drink till you car spin you then\n\nDamn!\n\nU slam into the wall and you fall\nOut the car, trying to crawl with one arm\nAbout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol\nIf my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops\n\n\nLet's see how many of your men loyal,\nWhen I pull up looking for you,\nWith a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil\nI'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode\nWith red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon\nBraggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you\nNiggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance\nUnderstand I can enchance the spirit of man\nDeath itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really\nIrks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk\nBe smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark\nHug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic\nI'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like\nYou high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night\n\nWhen The Music Stops\n\n\nInstigators, turn pits in cages\nLet loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors\nYou all don't want war, you want talk\nIn the dark my dogs all bark like woof\nProof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof\nCaved in like reindeer hoofs\nStomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose\nThe more you all breach, the more I moves\nThis hill street, this is hardcore blues\nPut a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)\nOr make the news betcha all you all move\nWhen the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop\n\n\nMusic's changed my life in so many ways\nBrains confused and fucked since the 5th grade\nLL told me to rock the bells\nNWA said fuck the police\nNow I'm in jail\n93 was strictly R&B\nFucked up hair cut\nListen to Jodeci\nMichael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike\nAss cheeks painted white\nFucking Presilla at night\nFlying down sunset smoking crack\nTransvestite in the front\nEddi Murphy in the back\nMOP had me grindy and griddy\nMarilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue\nAnd grew some titties\nLudacris told me to throw them bowls\nNow I'm in the hospital\nBroken nose and a fractured elbow\nVoices in my head, I'm going in shock,\nI'm reaching for the glock but the music stops\n",
