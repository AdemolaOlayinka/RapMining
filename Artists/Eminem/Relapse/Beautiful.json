    "lyrics": "Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world where they can be alone\nAre you calling me? Are you trying to get through?\nAre you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?\n\nI'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump\nIf I could just get over this hump\nBut I need something to pull me out this dump,\nI took my bruises, took my lumps\nFell down and I got right back up\nBut I need that spark to get psyched back up\nIn order for me to pick the mic back up\nI don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in\nI'm starting to feel distant again\nSo I decided just to pick this pen\nUp and try to make an attempt to vent\nBut I just can't admit\nOr come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap\nI need a new outlet, and I know some shit's so hard to swallow\nBut I just can't sit back and wallow\nIn my own sorrow\nBut I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow\nOne tough act to follow\nI'll be one tough act to follow\nHere today, gone tomorrow\nBut you'd have to walk a thousand miles\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you\nSo don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nOh, they can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you, yeah, so...\nI think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor\nEverything is so tense and gloom\nI almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room\nJust as soon as I walk in\nIt's like all eyes on me\nSo I try to avoid any eye contact\n'Cause if I do that then it opens the door for conversation\nLike I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention\nI just want to be just like you\nBlend in with the rest of the room\nMaybe just point me to the closest restroom\nI don't need no fucking man servant\nTrying to follow me around and wipe my ass\nLaugh at every single joke I crack\nAnd half of them ain't even funny like\n\"Ha!, Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, God damn\"\nUnfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown\nSo why don't you all sit down?\nListen to the tale I'm about to tell\nHell, we don't gotta trade our shoes\nAnd you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nOh they can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you so\nDon't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nOh they can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you so\nNobody asked for life to deal us\nWith these bullshit hands we're dealt\nWe gotta take these cards ourselves\nAnd flip them, don't expect no help\nNow I could have either just\nSat on my ass and pissed and moaned\nOr take this situation in which I'm placed in\nAnd get up and get my own\nI was never the type of kid\nTo wait by the door and pack his bags\nWho sat on the porch and hoped and prayed\nFor a dad to show up who never did\nI just wanted to fit in\nIn every single place\nEvery school I went\nI dreamed of being that cool kid\nEven if it meant acting stupid\nAunt Edna always told me \"Keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that\"\nMeanwhile I'm just standin' there\nHoldin' my tongue tryna talk like this\n'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old\nI learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no more\nBut I already told you my whole life story\nNot just based on my description\n'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting\nIt's probably 110% different\nI guess we would have to walk a mile\nIn each other's shoes, at least\nWhat size you wear? I wear tens\nLet's see if you can fit your feet\nIn my shoes, just to see\nWhat it's like, to be me\nI'll be you, let's trade shoes\nJust to see what it'd be like to\nFeel your pain, you feel mine\nGo inside each other's minds\nJust to see what we find\nLook at shit through each other's eyes\nBut don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh\nThey can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you\nSo don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful\nOh, they can all get fucked.\nJust stay true to you, yeah, so...\n\nLately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own\nEverybody has a private world where they can be alone...\nSo are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?\nAre you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?\nSo oh oh\n\nYeah... To my babies. Stay strong.\nDaddy will be home soon\nAnd to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes\nTo fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em\nBe yourself, man, be proud of who you are\nEven if it sounds corny,\nDon't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful\nSo...\n",
