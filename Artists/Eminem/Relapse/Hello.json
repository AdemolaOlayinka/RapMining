Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth\nDown the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it\nA rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet (A tac-tac-tacin a whore) with a damn hatchet\nA nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs\nShorty come back, I'm trying to score me some lapdances I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels\nFormula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules\nThe bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya\n\nWell I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nAnd are you menstruating baby, my little friend's waiting to say Hello\nThe way your titties are wiggling and your booty shaking like Jello\nGirl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nMy equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em It just becomes everyday extracurriculum No reason in particular, it was strictly fun\nA fifth of rum and two bottles of 151 51 people asleep in my damn living room\nScuse me hun? But what is your name, (Vivian?) (I woke up) next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?\nOf course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun? I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one\nNo offense baby girl I don't mean any harm\nBut disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from (I find the package) and I'm cool,\nI immediately run like Speedy Gon- Zalez to see if I see anyone\nWho might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some My head is pounding to the beat of the drum\n\nWell I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nAnd do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?\nSome are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow\nGirl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nOh, those were the days, they certainly were\nIt's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good\n(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)\nI second that and a third, rush to emergency surgery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged\n(He's no longer getting) the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-adins\nBuster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in\nPain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurting him'\nTirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up muscle relaxants for his back and a couple of packs\nSince now he's doubling back-wards and he stumbling back\nSlipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack\nNow he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap\nAlmost ended it that soon because of the fact I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap\nResuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back\nAnd so I'm saying...\n\nWell I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nAnd do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow,\nSome are oval, and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow\nGirl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello\nHello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself My name is Shady\nSo nice to meet you It's been a long time sorry I've been away so long\nMy name is Shady I never meant to leave you\n",
