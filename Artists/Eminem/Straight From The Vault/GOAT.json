No\nYou better save some of them kids from Madonna\nshe needs all the publicity she can get\nyou want a Shady? Well, you got it, man\nI ain't apologizin' for shit.\nI'm a goat\nand I don't mean to gloat\nbut I know what I know and I know what you think\nand these magazines'll never put it in ink\nbecause how would it look if they considered me as a goat?\nand for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is\nit means the greatest of all time\nand I consider myself one of those\nso thank you very much, here it goes!\nMan, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man\nshit is too easy\nnobody even wants to pass me the ball cause\n(I'm a goat)\nso don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game\nand y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best\nbut y'all know that\n(I'm a goat)\nand like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best\nbefore you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch\nbut before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start\nand thank you very much to everybody who was\nand y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it\ncause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know\n(I'm a goat)\n(hahahaha)\nI'm out, y'all\nit's been real, peace\n",
