    "lyrics": "Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest\nPencil is full of insolent bullets\nI'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'\nMixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken\nI begin to spitting like vintage Pac, demented\nDemonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me\nThe day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit\nSo to not see him with me would be a shocking image\nAnd I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is\nCause no matter how many times you sock me in it\nAnd knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics\nKnow that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish\nEat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope\nBut I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this\nAnd put emphasis on the \"dope,\" so when names come up\nIn that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it\nAnd don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow\nYou won't find anywhere, where it fires and I unload my pen explodes\n'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time\nLet insults fly even sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it\nIn school I was so shy, timid\nTwo pairs of jean's I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member\nBegging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new\nSt. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted\nBut kissed them old days, adios, I did it\nThey said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic\nNow you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument\nCause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front\n\nDon't front, you know I got you open, kid\n\nRest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me\nMolded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me\nI love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete\nI'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet\nI'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne\nBetter watch the fucking tone that you speak, feel like I'm in the zone\nI'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me\nNo opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat\nFrom beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat\nI'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appetit\nCause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat\nBitch, nobody's mind works like mine\nIt's nose to the grindstone time, holmes, your mind's blown\nCause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed, up in the Ebony Show-\n-case with Denaun screaming \"Who the fuck passed you the mic?\"\nNever asked you like my shit from the get\nI'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch\nYou had you a nice run, now take a hike\nI ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first\nCause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers\nThe real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking\nWord to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?\nYou don't like it? Suck a cock! Almost forgot\nBefore I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down\nCause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud\nThey jerked me around so what's up now?\nWow, how much of an asshole would I sound like\nRubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front\n\n\nLate at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write\nNow I write the type of shit to make you wipe\nBut wear diapers cause you might leave a streak\nI'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe\nIt's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight\nCause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting\nThis fire under me, it's breathing new life, it's like I already died once\nI guess some people only live twice, and it's funny\nMy days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money\nBut you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me\nOh shit, I'm down on one knee\nI'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey\nFrom boy to man, it's still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland\nI'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars\nI never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band\nNo offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met\nMiddle finger pressed against Moby's nose\nShouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show\n(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)\nYou can't take it, oh\nGot a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow\nBut convince me you've heard\nAn MC since me who's this good with the fucking mincing of words\nWithout mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve\nWhose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn\nIt'll be like my skin being Indian burned\nHah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?\nNever been served if memory serves\nI'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words\n\nYou know I got you open kid, stop fronting\nYou know I got you open, Word Life\n",
