You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in trouble!\nWhat's occurin befo', after and durin the show\nhas no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa\nWhat is it, wordplay? No I'm pushin you out the do'\nSo suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow\nNow stomp your fuckin feet 'til you get to squishin a hoe\nIt's pandemo-nium standin know when you see him, oh\nDamn baby you look good, you're givin me wood\nYou should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood\nIt's neck work, get her polly on, you and me both\nBreak bread while I'm coppin over this game to pinch a loaf\nNow homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?\nWho claims to be spittin the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed\nIn other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas\nDestroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash\nWent through 'em and laughed\nCame back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!\nSo stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass\nSlaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap\nand Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?\nSlut, answer me that, Royce where you at?\n\nI'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you\nLump on your head designed by a bar stool\nDesigned by a cartoon\nBefore I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall\nThe 9 tucked against the linin\nI pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in\nIt's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!\nFUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!\nYou're screamin fuck the world with your middle finger up\nWhile I'm over here shovin my dick in a hole in the mud\nMy bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder\nbecause I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove\nI got a Posse of Insane Clowns\nBlow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds\nBad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral\nYou on your last burrito!\n(What that mean Nickel?) It's a wrap if you eatin\nGet a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern\nSlaughterhouse on FIRE, nobody touchin that\nGood day and good night, Ortiz yo where the FUCK you at?\n\nI'm right here in my Nike Airs, Buzz Light-years\nahead of my mic peers, quite scary to look at a nightmare\nWhere my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares\nI harbor the art, of you nice swear {?}\nIt's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear\nUncle Al's breath after polishin off his ninth beer\nHomie chill, listen, I swear\nI'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears\nI'm right here, why wouldn't I be?\nJust waitin to be hooked to IV as {?} as well when you look at my pee\nAnd this joint, no exception, so just point a direction\nAnd record the pig's oink, when I rip his intestine\nThis isn't just an infection\nThis won't go away with penicillin injections\nMillions of questions arose after they did an inspection, what I exhibit\nseems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it\nAw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen\nI emitted this phlegm, this time it's alongside Emiddinem\nSo tell a friend to tell a friend write a disgustin hook\nJump in shark water and swim, yo where the fuck is Crook?\n\nI'm right here lettin the shottie pop, quick as a karate chop\nGet your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop\nCall it Maserati drop, in the body shop\nGet your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped\nI take your life to the ninth inning\nA knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winnin\nI laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny\nI'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money\nMan, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches\nthen jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala\nI ball like Iguodala, I bear more arms than six koalas\nAs soon as I draw, get sent to Allah\nBilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun\nI'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn\nI pillage your village for fun, an egregious con\nA syllable gun, real as they come, Long Beach Saddam!\nSlaughterhouse equals swine flu, are South flyin\nWe do it to try to do without tryin\n(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy\nWhere's, Jumpoff Joe Beezy?\n",
