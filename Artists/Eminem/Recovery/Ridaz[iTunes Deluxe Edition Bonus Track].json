    "lyrics": "Aw man...\nYeah\u2026\nYou ever be in the club man, you get in a fight\nAnd people that you don't even know jump in?\nYou feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed\nYou just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this\nYou're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away\nFrom splitting your shit wide open, no stitches can save\nYou'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way\nYou end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid\nRazors, scissors and blades make Jason say \"Isn't this great?\"\nOn-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate\nThat's starting to take place in the middle of the street\nLittle did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat\nEmergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late\nIt's absolute pandemonium\nWhisked away in an ambulance is your fate\nNothing nobody told you when you left the house today\nCould of made you anticipate Such an ass-whipping, okay\n'til the anger dissipates\nYou get punched in the face, reciprocate, come on\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nYou step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case\nAnxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies\nYou better go get your mace cause Shady said so\nYou may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face\nThat's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?\nIf you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill\nCause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill\nI got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill\nGirl howdy, how do you feel ma?\nThis cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah\nHe must be trying to kill my buzz\nI will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?\nNow here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat\nAnd that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that\nCause they want in on the act, there's a cognac bottle\nWe snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap\nI'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts\nYou're frightened like \"This guy might hurt me\"\nYou're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder\nPlay smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to\nDig your way out or go powder your nose\nPussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes\nYou set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose\nWe settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nIt's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles\nWe're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and\nAdrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing\nToo much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing\nMy signature ligature marks, look at you all\nBig with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart\nAt least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart\nAnd dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are\nThe predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car\nThe pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre\nShit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far\nAs having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ahh\nYou hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that\nYou catch an open hand slap like a female like bap\nIn fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves\nWhere's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nYeah, what the deal?\nI'm feeling hard as hell right now homie\nI almost feel... Invincible and shit\nAy Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool\nI'm unstoppable\nDamn\n",
