I said wiat first\ntry this hallucionagin, its better than heroin and the the booze and the gin.\ncome here lets go in here. Who's in the den? (It's me and Kelly) my bad! lets\ntry another room \"I don't trust you\" shut up slut chew up this mushroom. this\nwill help you get in touch with your roots. We'll get bare-foot but naked and run\nin the woods. \"oh hell might as well try 'em this party is so drag.\" Oh dag I\ndidn't mean for you to eat the whole bag! (huh)\n\n\n\"Yo Sue!\"\nGet away from me, I don't know you\nOh shoot, she's tripping..\nI need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)\nI wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major\nI just wanted to make you appreciate nature.\nSusan stop crying i don't hate ya. the worlds not against you I'm sorry your\nfather raped ya. So what, you had your coochie in your dad's mouth. Thats no\nreason to start wiggin and spaz out.\nshe said \"Help me I think I'm having a seisure!\"\nI said \"I'm high too (bitch) Quit grabbin my T-shirt (let go!)\nWould you calm down you're startin to scare me.\nshe said \" I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married. I don't have any\nkids and I can't cook\"\nI'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!\nWe need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late\nCause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate.\n\n\nSusan (wait!) Where you goin? You better be careful\nLeave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled\nI'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue\nWant some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb\nI'll be right back just chill baby please?\nI gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these.\n\"John, where's Dave at before I bash you?\"\nHe's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!\n\"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance\nThere's a girl upstairs talkin to plants\nchoppin her hair off, and there's only two days left\nof Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?\"\nWell it depends on how many you had? I took three she ate the other\ntwenty-two caps Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs,drinking lysol.\n\"She's gonna die dude.\" I know and it's my fault!\nMy god!\n\nMy God, I'm so sorry!\nI'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!\nPlease! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!\nYou're not dead!! You're NOT dead!\nI know you're not dead!\n",
