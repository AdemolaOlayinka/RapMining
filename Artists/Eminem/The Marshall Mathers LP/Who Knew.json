Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up\nYou want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?\nFuck that, take drugs, rape sluts\nMake fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up\nGet aware, wake up, get a sense of humor\nQuit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement\n(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace\nYou shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents\n\nCause I never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid\nI never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch\nI never knew I, knew I would get this big\nI never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid\nI never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist\nI never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch\n\nSo who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)\nI couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London\nAnd last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie\nwhere he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi\nI sees three little kids, up in the front row,\nscreamin \"Go,\" with their 17-year-old Uncle\nI'm like, \"Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads\nwho got mad when I asked if they liked violence?\"\nAnd told me that my tape taught 'em to swear\nWhat about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?\n(Hmm?) So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words\nwhen his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse\n(\"Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!\")\nAnd fuck was the first word I ever learned\nup in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)\nSo read up, about how I used to get beat up\npeed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months\nMy life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)\nFucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike\nSo how much easier would life be\nif 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?\n\n\nI never knew I.. knew I'd..\nhave a new house or a new car\nA couple years ago I was more poorer than you are\nI don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?\nFuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)\nSkibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves\nSonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)\nHow many retards'll listen to me\nand run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a\nteach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?\n\"Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!\"\nDamn! How much damage can you do with a pen?\nMan I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been\nif you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought\nSlim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought\nthat woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop\nI just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not\n\n\nHow the fuck was I supposed to know?\n",
