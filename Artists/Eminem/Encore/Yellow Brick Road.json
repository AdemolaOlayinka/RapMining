If you wish to be\nsaved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or\nwhich over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should\nmove up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.\n\n\nCome on, let's cut the bullshit enough\nLet's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up\nLet's take this shit back to basement\nAnd we can discuss statements thats made on this tape\nAnd its whole origin of the music that we all know and love\nThe music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy\nLet's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit\nCrossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory\nI'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me\nYou will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here\nYou've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere\nFrom Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there\nFrom the black side all the way to the white side\nOK there's a bright side a day that I might slide\nYou may call it a past I call it hauling my ass\nThrough that patch of grass over them railroad tracks\nOh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks\nThem good old notorious oh well known tracks\n\n\nSo lets go back\nFollow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\nI once used to call home sweet home\n\n\nI roam the streets so much they call me a drifter\nSometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike\nJust to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke\nAnd steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard\nAnd drop it off at the park that was the half way mark\nTo meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark\nTo sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's\nThats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps\nAt Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows\nAt Centerline High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime\nHe looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme\nI spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place\nAnd we both had the same rhymes that sound alike\nWe was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined\nFrom that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line\n\n\nSo lets go back\nFollow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\nI once used to call home sweet home\n\n\nMy first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school\nIt was cool till your man MC Shan came through\nAnd said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops\nIt was rumors but man, god damn, they flew\nMust've been true because man we done banned they shoes\nI had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too\nAnd we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news\nGuess who came through next, X-clan debut\nProfessor X vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green\nWith a key sissies now with this being a new trend\nWe don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums\nBlackness is in, African symbols and medallions\nRepresents black power and we ain't know what it meant\nMe and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em\nAll over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all\nWe was being laughed at you ain't even half black\nYou ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that\nAnd that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that\nAll I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement\nsaying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...\nWhich reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time\nShe was tryna two time me and there was this black girl\nAt our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me\nAnd oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus\nThe same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs\nThe bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it\nNot only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time\nBut it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy\nAnd thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl\nBut I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad\nBut it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize\nI was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe\n\n\nSo lets go back\nFollow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode\nJourney with me as I take you through this nifty little place\nI once used to call home sweet home\n",
