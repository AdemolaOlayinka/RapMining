Snoop Dogg
Tha Blue Carpet Treatment
2006)
I was chilling, right around my way, 
21st Eastside at a beach, 
This motherfucker ran up on me, 
Talking shit wit his homies like he was 
A straight... 
G! 

Asking where I'm from while he running up, Gangbang my set’ll nag one of them, 
Some things, sons they just won’t change, 
Fools dont respect nothing but the gang bang, 
What's seen is what's sawn, Dogg is the law,
I hate you niggas running like a marathon, Lil G's tryna creep on the east wit it,
Talking bout they gon get my chain and they gon leave with it. 
But they dont know, once they get close its tic tac toe,
3 motherfuckers laid on the floor (Watch out),
Yea this happened yesterday, on the West they
Spray, 
I Heard an Ese Say... 
He said.. 


Vato you won't believe what they saw, 
I saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?) 
They twisted fingers say you know who we are... 
He said: I dont give a fuck I’m Snoop Doggy Dogg ... (Ah huh) 
They kept fucking and it went too far, 
So Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?),
he got his gun and they start running hard,
he started firing and then he just charged... 
PLOW!!! 


Run Nigga, Run Nigga (Plow) 
Duck Nigga, Duck Nigga (Plow) 
Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 
Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow) 

I didn't mean to hit what I hit 
Now that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit 
But these niggas a scream wit plea but for like a G like me it’s just a case 
Believe and you can see 
I crack the mac back and pop off rolling 
And smack your neck back, you drop off falling 
I haven't seen my mama in a week 
And she ain't even ran her mouth about me 
Fuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law 
Niggas say they wanna brawl 
You would think that they wore bra’s 
Believe in all the things that you never saw 
In it y’all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menathol 
You think you know? But this can't go 
You think you’ll blow, all my dough? 
What the fuck, no 
See these niggas proceed with speed 
So feel the need to bleed 
All you hear my enemies going

Run Nigga, Run Nigga (Plow) 
Duck Nigga, Duck Nigga (Plow) 
Run Motherfucker, Run (Plow)

I wouldn't be the nigga that I am 
If I didn't pop niggas in their mouth. 
God Damn 
If Snoop a keep a foot on the streets 
And lead and cover the sheets 
Run wit them niggaz wit the heat 
You never seen a thug like this 
You never seen a dub like me 
And I ain't weak for wanting peace in fact 
I could be beast of the East motherfucker. 
I never hesitate to blaze 
A nigga really tryna change his ways 
We gotta move my team cuz my people’s 
Are screaming that we need more for fun or is it legal (With a bang) 
On this song make it feel like a drive-by 
It's ashame but somebody gotta die 
They say it happens state to state 
But when I'm mobbin’ LA 
All I hear the Ese’s say they go
