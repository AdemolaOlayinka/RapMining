I was just thinkin to myself man\nY'know this Blue Carpet Treatment record is deep to me\nAnd I need to let my peoples know how deep it is to me\nOn some real talk like...\n\nIt's like lookin and poppin and seein whoppers and movers\nDespite a Guidant, I try to be hard on the low\nNobody's guidance so I decided to sleep by the do'\nOpen my mind try to slip inside my grandpa's fo'\nDriftin off into another stage of life\nNigga paid ya price and big homies made ya fight\nNiggaz ain't wanna see ya nigga be-bop, no\nToe for toe, I beat a nigga down to the flo'\n\n\nIncredible, forgettable, better blast, past, to move the mind\nMany men were eradicated by music minds\nOpen ya eyes and take ya time to visualize\nAnd once ya decide to move ya mind in due time\nIt's so erotic, if it ain't exotic, it's gettin naughty\nFreeze and groove, get rowdy, rowdy; girl move ya body\nIt's melodic, I'm bein honest and modest\nYou done fucked off my whole rap flow, think about it\n\n\nFuck that nigga, I'ma do it right\nThangs ain't movin right, I don't think that you would like\nfor me to be mad, saying, \"Niggaz can't stand me\"\nSittin at home, watchin motherfuckers at the Grammy's\nWishin I was there, naw nigga I don't wish no more\nI'm the big cat, fish in the bowl\nBasically you hear these rappers out here using my flow\nThey need Snoop on they song to make they shit official though\nIn dismissible, police a nigga, modern day KMI\nTakin my time, chronolizing my rhyme\nWriting my rhyme, tryin to get intellectual\nDirecting the weather, makin my negative records more intellectual\nTryin to change the direction of flowin\nAnd sayin, born sayin, \"You know I get live-er when I get fluent\"\n\nAin't been nobody to change game since King came\nSame thing, same lane, hit it and ya get banged\nWord to Rob Bass, just make the music dope\nThangs don't change man, it's so remarkable\nAnd they don't know how to do it 'cause they don't flow that way\nGo that way, roll that Jay\nRoll my tape and take me back the day you were phony\nYou're so into what ya doin but you can't get into it\nYou can't talk and now ya ruined but y'know I'ma do it\nAnd now you doin it, they booing like, \"You blew it! You blew it!\"\nI'm dippin through the universe, make 'em move the verse\nThrough the Luda-verse, hit the boota first\nYou can never beat a hoe, lemme show you how to treat a hoe\nIf you likin me, follow me, you so believable\n(So...) Got a way to get his own music out\nRecord executive, bounce ballin and actin bad\nTake my time, with my.. great mind\nTake 'em out, make mine, kicked about it\nThanks to niggaz who might make it illegal\nAnd not rival the Beatles, and rock, rockin my peoples\nAnd fly, fly like eagles been doin the shit like liters\nAnd hittin y'all with heaters and walkin in my Adida's\nI continue to bust, then I switched up to chucks\nGivin niggaz a puff, still givin it up\nBeanie Sigel what up? Real niggaz is up\nOn the scheme with my team, yeah Daz and Kurupt\n\n\n\n\nWe bust 'til we buss 'em up\n(Lay Low), I know they told you not to fuck with us\nLayin and playin, and sayin man, walkin in vain\nAnxious for fame, my nigga tryin to walk in my lane\nAnd tryin to.. walk in my shoes but they just don't fit\nYou couldn't spit the shit that I spit 'cause I'm the shit\nAnd this is it, legit, let's split the chips\nAnd fix, and move the work and hurt that bitch\nI'm through with this!\n",
