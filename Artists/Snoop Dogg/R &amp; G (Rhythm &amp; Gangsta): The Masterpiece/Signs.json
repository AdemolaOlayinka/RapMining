(OHHH!!!)\n\n\nDon't think about it, boy leave her alone\n(Ooh wee!!) Nigga you ain't no G!\nShe likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!\n\n\nIt's legit, you know it's a hit\nWhen The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit\nYou know he's in - tune with the season\nCome here baby, tell me why you leaving?\nTell me if it's weed that you needing\nYou wanna breathe? I got the best weed minus seeds\nAin't nobody tripping VIP they can't get in\nIf something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping\n\n\nI'm not sure what I see\nYou better don't fuck wit me!\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\nShe's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\n\n\nDon't think about it, boy leave her alone\n(Oh ohhh!! yeah!) Nigga you ain't no G!\nShe likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!\n\n\nNow you stepping wit a G, from Los Angeles\nWhere helicopters got cameras, just to get a glimpse of our Chucks\nAnd our Khakis and our bouncer cars\nYou wit you friend right? (yeah)\nShe ain't trying to bring over no men right? (no)\nShiieet, she ain't gotta be in the distance\nShe could get high all in an instant\n\n\nI'm not sure what I see\nYou better don't fuck wit me!\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\nShe's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\n\n\nDon't think about it, boy leave her alone\n(Oh ohhh!! yeah!) Nigga you ain't no G!\nShe likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!\n\n\nMami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s\nFrom London - to Ibiza. You gotta have Cape Town\nYou'll have Sunday's with chiquitas\nYou'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena\nAnd I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)\n\n\nNigga don't be young and foolish\nYou don't know what you're doing\nYou don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)\nAnd her pretty face, drove you wild\nBut you ain't got that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style\n\n\nI'm not sure what I see\nCupid don't fuck wit me!\nAre you telling me this is a sign?\nShe's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys\nAre you telling me this is a sign? (OHHH!!!)\n\n\nDon't think about it, boy leave her alone\n(Ooh wee!!) Nigga you ain't no G!\nShe likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll (hey!) you ain't no G!\n(Ooh wee!!) You ain't no G!
