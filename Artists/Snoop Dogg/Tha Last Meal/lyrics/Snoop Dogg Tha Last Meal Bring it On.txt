Of hate and pain
We need a remedy 
To help us through the rain

And every bitch ? in a multiply ways

Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket 
So she could smell like the big girl
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass.

Watch your mouth, Watch your mouth

And separate you from your children (Daddy)

Paying motherfuckers off cause sucka duck

Scratch the fence and don't fell

Did the weed, man get in 
Take it too long 
But when he get it dogg

Don't abuse 
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker.
