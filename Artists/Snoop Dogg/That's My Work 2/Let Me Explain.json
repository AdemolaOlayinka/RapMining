I'm doin me and what?!\nStill look good too and what? Nigga you see me? You see me man\nNigga! Nigga look at the boy! Nigga look at the boy!\nI see ya! Uh Look look look look hey hey hey look real quick\n\nYep! I'm like go team Erick\nI was born with dopeness just swag you inherit (Uh Huh!)\nKids! This is why I'm hot\nPlayboy approach me wrong, this is why I shot\nHuh! Ball! I get the game from my pop\n'Til everyone know my name the game don't stop\nNow! Not! So I keep pumpin the block\nUntil I'm big as Rihanna and Mason's rock\nWhile you love Sosa\nI'm over here lovin this RG3 Redskin that's on my sofa\nHer ass alone man bigger than Oprah\nPuerto Rican, Dominican first name Rosa\nAnyway, let me explain one time\nUzi, we up in here makin a movie\nCheck Slate, it's a wrap\nI'm a bigger nigga with figure you figure how's that? HUH!\n\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)\n(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)\n\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\n\nMy money bigger than homie you funny niggas is phony\nTony told me he showed me so I gotta get mine\nLet me just slip into the back of the wide\nOpen your eyes let your window down now you in the passenger side\nGet in, now you get it, quit it and with it\nWaan come test me now tell 'em the Lion did it\nAnd bit 'em off a chip of the block of the wood\nLil' homie couldn't rock if he could click cockin and pull\nHip hopin over lot of the bull more pull\nAnd yes, I am paid and full\nFa schizzay, my nizzay, Erick D-i-iznay!\nThat's all I'm a sizznay, okizzay\n'Cause I'm too mean too cool too cold too slick\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick\nThat nigga Snoop about to take yo' bitch\nWith no hesitation or explanation\nPimp!\n\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey!

Nigga look real quick!\n\nYo! Like a room full of black of raw heat\nThey see the flow back gettin all geek, It's like I'm Pete Charles I'm all street\nThey come in time money but talk cheap\nBut rappers wanna kick it I'm all feet\nEvery line artistic that's all me, my man's son autistic that's so key\nThe why go and get it I'm so G\nThat's why I wear the fitted so low key, that's why I kill the critic for no fee\nThen tell the judge I did it and go free\nE double E my co-d\nLet's throw the book at 'em what's yo' plea?\nGuilty as charged that's how it is when your guilty and charged\nTook a bunch of Def, artist and built me a Squad\nWhat's today's math? Build with the God, weed, women and cars\nLock the game down I'm givin 'em bars\nWhat is life if you ain't livin it large? If you ain't livin it large\nGo get the price checked and get you a job\nBut wait\n\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey! Let me explain this\nHey! Hey! (SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)\n(LIL' ASS NIGGA! SAY IT WITH YOUR CHEST!)\n\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\nHey! Hey! Nigga look real quick!\n\nYeah!\n",
