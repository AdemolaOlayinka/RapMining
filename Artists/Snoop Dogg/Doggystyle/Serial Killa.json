Aiyyo what's up with the crew?\nIs them niggaz in jail, or are them niggaz through?\"\ni said, if you ain't up on thangs\nSnoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the game\nIt's like this they don't understand\nIt's an everyday thang, to gangbang\nMake that twist, don't be a bitch, let these niggaz know\nWhat's up with you I represent the Pound and Death Row\nAnd can't no other motherfucker in L.A. or Long Beach\nand Compton, and Watts, see D-O-G's\nNow, you can't come and you can't run, and you can't\nsee long to the G of the gang\nOne gun is all that we need, to put you to rest\nPump pump, put 2 slugs dead in your chest\nNow you dead then a motherfucker, creepin and sleepin\n6 feet deep in, fuckin with the Pound is\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n\n\n\nThe cloud becomes black, and the sky becomes blue\nNow you in the midst of the Dogg Pound crew\nAin't no clue, on why the fuck we do what we do\nLeave you in a state of paranoia, oooh\nDon't make a move for your gat so soon cuz\nI drops bombs like Platoon (ay nigga)\nWalk with me, hold my hand and let me lead you\nI'll take you on a journey, and I promise I won't leave you\n(I won't leave you) until you get the full comprehension\nAnd when you do, that's when the mission\nor survival, becomes your every thought\nKeep your eyes open, cuz you don't wanna be caught\nHalf steppin with your weapon on safety\nNow break yourself motherfucker 'fore you make me\ntake this 211 to another level\nI come up with your ends, you go down with the devil\nNow roam through the depths of hell\nWhere the rest your buster ass homeboys dwell\nWell...\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin name\nSerial killa, serial killa, serial killa\n\n(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)\n\n\n\nDeep, deep like the mind of Minolta, now picture this!\nLet's picnic inside a morgue\nNot pic-a-nic baskets, pic-a-nic caskets\nAnd I got the machine, that cracks your fuckin chest plates\nopen and release them guts\nThen I release def cuts\nBrutal, jagged edged, totally ruffneck\nNow everybody scream nuff respect to the X\nNuff respect given\nDisrespect and you will not be livin\nWord to momma, Emma, drama, dilemma\n\nSuicide, it's a suicide\n\nNow tell me, what's my motherfuckin name\nSerial killa, serial killa, serial killa\n\n(Wake up in the morning, to Lucky Charms cereal)\n",
