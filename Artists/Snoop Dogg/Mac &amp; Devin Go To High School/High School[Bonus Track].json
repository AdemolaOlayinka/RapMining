Or will you pass?\nSmoke grass, trim trees\nTryin to find some air to breath\nMessed up, please baby, baby please\nDiplomas, Gowns, Caps and Degrees\nThese are necessities\nIn life ya need\nSome gone and did it\nFocus, Committed\n15 years later, the year a nigga finally did it\nNow who\u2019s to say in life is up, slow down?\nAnd when you get up, you gotta get down.\nAnd when you get up, look around\nAnd don\u2019t frown on the ones that down\nJust give \u2018em a hand\nIt\u2019s like mix and fixin up pots and pans\nListen up, I\u2019m poppin up like rockin the band\nNo playin, all from the heart to the hand\nWe gon roll it, smoke it, and do it again.\nI\u2019m the apprentice\nBack on my pimp shit\nRoll it, puff it, now give it to him\nPhysical fitness\nSmokin\u2019 relentless\nNouns and pronouns, they make up my sentence\nHigh School days. Blowin on the purple haze\nHigh School days. Blowin on the purple haze\n\nAnd you know everywhere that we go if it\u2019s there for its Mac then we blow it by the O\nNiggas know me for rollin\u2019 the OGs on someone low key, twistin a whole bush\nAnd if I got it, then you can get it; it\u2019s on us\nSmoke so much product that they prolly give me my own kush\nWe blow it by the zone\nBreak down, blow it at a bone\nTake you to my crib and show you how to roll, bro\nAnd my pockets lookin kinda swole\nMe and Mac smoking Grade A on a roll\nNow all of the teachers on us\nThey can have contact cuz I keep diplomas\nCar automatic don\u2019t need the key to start it\nKnow it\u2019s us juzt cuz of the weed aroma\nLookin for me, nigga, I\u2019m in the tree department\nWith a doobie rolled up in a secret compartment\nTryin to finish up this speech and get my diploma\nSo I can a career where my OG can harvest\nAnd my niggas can ball\nI\u2019m talkin so much weed that there\u2019s shit in the walls\nIt start growing the spring and get picked in the fall\nI\u2019m used to goin to every class, but I\u2019m missin them all\nFuckin with Mac, smoking spliffs in the hall\nSinging this song like\nNiggas know me, blowin on the OG\nNiggas know me, blowin on the OG\nNiggas know me\n\nHigh School Niggas\nDev and Mac, Mac and Dev\nPut it in a Zag\nPut it in a Blunt\nDo what you want\n",
