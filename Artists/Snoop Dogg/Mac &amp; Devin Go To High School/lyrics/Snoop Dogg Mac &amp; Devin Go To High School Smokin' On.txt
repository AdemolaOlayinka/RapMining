Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though

Cut those cameras on cause my camera’s on
And my niggas backing me riding around town
With a big old bag of weed
Taylor Gang, we ain’t in your faculty
Me and Snoop Dogg, we created a masterpiece
Smoke all day and we making this cash, and we
Bout it bout it like Master P
Go hard, stack ya cheese, roll a joint, pass the trees
TGOD, he’s the OG, real G shit what it has to be
My real niggas gon pop tags for me
Fake niggas gon get bags for me
Say you just wanna shake hands with me?
Same fuck niggas used to laugh at me
Now I’m riding around town in the car that you can’t even pronounce
And you can’t go fast as me
Smoking marijuana, and she know that I’m a player
So she wanna come up here spend that cash on me
That pimp shit come naturally
That fuck shit is wack to me
My kush grown organically
My balling is actually

Bet you get high but I ain’t smoking with the rest though
Cause if it’s in my joint, believe that it’s the best smoke
I’m talking OG kush from the West Coast
Watch how you hit it, just one hit will burn your chest, though
You like to smoke but you ain’t smoking what we smoking, no
You like to smoke but you ain’t smoking what we smoking, no

Let me turn you on to turn you out
To make you feel how you really wanna feel
For real, sho will, nigga I got that kill
You know what I got: Captain Crunch, soda pop
Light green kush cut from a bush
Mix it together, get it together
Hypo glow with the hydro flow
Smoking on some shit called I don’t know
This is that shit that was caught
From my niggas on the block with a .44 Glock—oh no!
Cutting it up, button it up
Homie don’t speak at all
You might stay, you might be most likely like shark bait
I might hate, nigga you smoking that lightweight
Wrong class, featherweight, levitate
Set it straight: let me break it down for you
Flip it, zip it, let it fly
If it’s good, it’s gonna get you high
Drop it, stop it, that ain’t the one
We don’t even smoke that shit for fun!


Yea nigga, I’m rolling up that high-grade
Chilling on the porch, smoking like it’s Friday
Every day of the week to Juicy J’s a high day
Niggas think I’m Chinese cause my eyes straight
I threw up a 6 into a 20 ounce
Smoked a half ounce of kush, felt like 20 ounces
Fucked around and popped a molly now I’m high as fuck
Every chick I'm seeing, Juicy screaming out, "Let’s fuck!"
I done popped a pill and hit the lean behind it
Where my mind? Somebody help me find it
Got a black and white bitch, they my mixed bitch
They keep my double cup full, OG in my Swisher
