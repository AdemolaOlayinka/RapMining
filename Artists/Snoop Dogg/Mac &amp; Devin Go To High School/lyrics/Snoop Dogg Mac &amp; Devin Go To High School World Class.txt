Uhh 
Keep sayin I'll do this, I'll do that
But you know 
I just keep doin the same shit
Haha, my fault, ha!

I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)
Probably never change (change)
I'm not tryin to be right, tryin to be wrong
I'm just tryin to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I'll (but I'll)
Probably be the same (same)

Every time I try to get my life together someone sees
what you're doin, tryin to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Push away, and always gon' get away
It keeps them grams in my pants, never hit a day
Am I wrong? Am I right? Do I care? Livin life
On my own, cop a zone, what it feelin like
Transition, premonition, whatchacallit, Mac a bone
Do my thang with my gang, put your back up on
Recollect and reflect, on how I used to be
I'm probably the same way cuz cause I'm gon' keep it G
Secretly, sacredly, y'all wake and bake with me
Solo creepin on the dolo tippin like a low-low
Fans come in vans and clans expectin to get that photo
Or either come backstage and have a chance to hit my dodo
Cool individual, I'm never too good
See Mac is from the hood, and never Hollywood


Uh, growin up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasin money and rollin stuff 'fore I was old enough
Gettin every dollar and fold it up
Puttin all our weed in papers instead of blunts so they can know it's us
Every party we showin up
Baggie full of pre-rolls, light it up and pass it
You holdin that one too long nigga, matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation, my motivation is cabbage
My Roley face filled with karats
And niggaz think they are but they know that they ain't comparin
And ain't doin no harm, I just don't think I'm into carin
I keep makin deposits and know ain't no interference from your broke ass
I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin mo' cash
And rollin weed, you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah I'm kinda high, but you should know that - hahaha
