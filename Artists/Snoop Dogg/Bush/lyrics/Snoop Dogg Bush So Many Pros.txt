Meet me out, can you make it?
Please don’t make me lie to you, lady
I’m in it, I’m not in it, but poochie says women
At the club we finna go, sip some drink and hit some dro
It’s ok if you don’t go, I’ll make sure to tell you 'bout these pros
It’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees
So many pros, it’s like somebody’s growin’ them on trees 
So many...
