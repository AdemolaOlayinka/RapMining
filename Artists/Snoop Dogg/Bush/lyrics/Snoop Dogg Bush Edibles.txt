And once it all dissolves (to the left)
And it mixes with the music (to the right)
And it makes you wanna do it (to the left)
In a way you never knew it (to the right)

Pass the dutchie to the left
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the right
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the left
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the right
Like it is 4/20
Pass the dutchie to the left
Come aboard the friendly sky's and let it go (cupcakes)
Here's my metaphor (cookies)
You so edible 
Lemme know for sure, you squidg your eyes and let it go (chocolate)
You already know (molly)
Its that edible, girl


Come along to the friendly sky's and enjoy the ride (cupcakes)
It makes the music life (cookies)
To get that body high girl
Come along to the friendly sky's you'd be occupied (chocolate)
Off the point of your mind (molly)
Without you feeling inside (cookies)


Badabang badabang
Got a chain you can see through
Graduated to a Range from a Regal
Hit the club and I leave with it 82
That's the difference between me and you
Just how we do it  went straight to the head
On a worldwide tour me and Skateboard
Ate more bitches in the lobby on the molly
Pretty sexy yet exotic fill em all in my Ferrari yep
I'd probably do a menage of 4 and 
Got em running upstairs got em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there
I solemnly swear, I will not share
This game with a lame, let him learn for himself
I owe a nigga shit, better earn for himself
Quit tripping on me, be concerned with yourself
