2008)
I got a penthouse in Manhattan 
Two more in Malibu 
I bought an 87 Cadillac Seville 
I got a Maserati too
I wear diamonds on my fingers 
A couple on my toes,
I wear the finest cologne money can buy
It keeps me smellin’ like a rose
If u wonderin’ how I do it
There’s just one simple rule...I’m just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...I’m just cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)
what’s the spell? (C-O-O-L)
I might dine in San Francisco
Dance all night in Rome
I go any freakin’ place I want to
And my lear jet brings me home
I got ladies by the dozen
I got money by the ton
Just aint nobody better 
Heaven knows that I’m the one
Its all because of something
That I didn’t learn in school,
Im just cool (cool)
Honey baby cant you see...I’m soo cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)
what’s that spell? (C-O-O-L)
and im cool im just cool (cool,cool,cool)
im just cool im just cool cool cool
when I look into the mirror 
theres just something I already know
im just cool(cool)
Honey baby cant you see...I’m just cool (cool) 
Aint nobody bad like me
Spell it (C-O-O-L)
Whats that spell? (C-O-O-L) cool 
Sing it baby cool
Whats that spell? (cool)
