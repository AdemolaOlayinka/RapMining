Snoop Dogg
Ego Trippin'
2008)
Ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"
When I'm ridin' in my Chevy and I'm sittin at the light (at the light)
I got kush in my blood, sippin' Remy keep it pimpin' with my pinky off the cut,
And all the people when they see me like "Snoop turn it up!"
Im in my zone MO'FUCKER, get stuck in the ribs by a old BONE CRUSHER,
Two tone leather with the soul of a HUSTLER,
Tryin' to stack mayos steal the clothes from my BROTHER, 
People wanna know am I close to my MOTHER,
Im a premature baby I'm ahead of the OTHERS.
Yes I'm aware of the GUTTER, ahead of my time, the games gettin' SMOTHERED
I stay on the grind but its only gettin ROUGHER
Niggas think I'm playin 'till they smokin' like a MUFFLER,
'bout to take like a lane open on you BUSTA'S.
Catch me if you can, in a world full of SUCKA'S
Niggas keep synthin', they wanna be USHER,
Until they get their eyes and coffin closed by the USHER,
Their punches wont work, you need more MUSTARD,
Lord lay 'em down, he need no sufferin', nigga!

Hmm, on my road to RICHES, I done seen a lotta roaches 'n' BITCHES
Thats why the dogg keep low in the DISTANCE,
But niggas don't know when to LISTEN, thats why I load AMMUNITION,
And stay in touch with my COMPETITION, I'm in touch with my COMPOSITION,
Roll a blunt, it's the coosh, yea we got PRESCRIPTIONS, just to defy,
No ENCRIPTIONS, pick a side, yea you know we CRIPPIN',
And through my eyes I see the world DIFFERENT, a hundred g's to record WITH 'EM,
Hit the gas, give me more ENGINE, this is somethin' that was born IN 'EM,
No game for a bitch just for a FIDDLE, I'm in tune give me more RHYTHM,
I let the bullets and the swords HIT 'EM, all p's like a Porsche EMBLEM,
Now make dead with the MORTICIAN, nigga, this big Snoop Dogg you best to listen,
You heard me?
