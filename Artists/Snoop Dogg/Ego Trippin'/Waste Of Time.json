Yeah, we could chill, we could talk\nWhen I look you in your eyes I no longer see sparks\nSo it's, best we go our seperate ways and stay apart\nNo more me and you boo, I done had a change of heart\n\n\nWaste of time, waste of time, waste of time\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nI'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nWaste of time, waste of time, waste of time\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nI'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright\nGo your way and I'll go mine\n\nI'm not sayin' I don't got love for you\nBut I'm not in love with you\n(I'm just not in love with you baby)\nI'm not sayin' I don't got love for you\nBut I'm not in love with you\nAnd feels like such a...\n\nWaste of time, waste of time, waste of time\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nI'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nWaste of time, waste of time, waste of time\nGo your way and I'll go mine\nI'm alright, I'm alright, I'll be alright\nGo your way and I'll go mine\n\n\nSorry it had to end this way\nBut uh, it is what it is\nI'm alright, don't worry about me\nI'm cool, ha ha, yeah\nYou go your way and I'll go mine\nReal talk, I'm cool, I ain't even trippin'\nI'ma roll out with Raphael\nYeah, fo sho, I'ma roll with him\nI'm cool, you go your way, I go mine\nI guess I'll see ya next lifetime\nSee ya, wouldn't wanna be ya\n",
