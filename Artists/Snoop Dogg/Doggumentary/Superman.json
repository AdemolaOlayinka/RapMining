Superman\nTryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand\nI ain't Superman - know what I'm talkin 'bout?\n\nI blew my throat and I blew my tour\nI wound up sippin on soup d'jour - I wasn't Superman\nOh no, I wasn't Superman\nI'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand\nI wasn't Superman\n\nI hear ya! Mickey play with us\n...\n\nYeah, play that Mickey, go ahead!\nPlay it Willie!\nYeah... go ahead Willie\n\nWell the doctor said son it's a cryin shame\nBut you ain't Clark Kent and I ain't Lois Lane\nYou ain't Superman; you ain't Superman\nTryin to do more than you can, you got a little outta hand\nYou ain't Superman - whaddya think Snoop?\n\nWell when I die, put it on my stone\nGod said Snoop you take your bad ass home you wasn't Superman\nHa ha ha, no, I wasn't Superman\nI'm tryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand\nI wasn't Superman (I hear ya!)\n\nTryin to do more than I can, I got a little outta hand\nI ain't Superman\n\nYeahhh!\n",
