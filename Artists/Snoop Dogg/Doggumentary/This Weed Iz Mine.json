    "lyrics": "I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good\nSmoking on some shit that you wish you could\nJealousy envy please don't feel bad\nThis weed is mine get your own bag\nA sack full of O.G. under lock and key\nNone for the homies this is all for me\nGot a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree\nPolice roll by I got nothing on me\nCause the smokes already in the air\nI'm locc'd up with two braids in my hair\nAll star star with the khaki suit\nI'm a fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop\nOn the east side standing on the V.I.P.\nBack then the only red was E-Y-E\nYou's a P.Y.T. and you looking so fine\nI'm sorry baby girl but tonight\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\nBack to the episode sacks full of chronic\nOut of this world could relax on a comet\nThis is church music listen to the choir\nTo burn my kush you must use fire\nD-O double G like never heard before\nSmoking that bomb like T-H-C 4\nWest coast worldwide seashore to seashore\nWhen's the last time you seen a G in a G4\nDon't worry I'll wait\nTimes ticking I'm tripping I'm slipping away\nInto a zone where these hoes on my dog bone\nA dog whistle and they download my ringtone\nAnd she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem\nWhat I got here is mine gone get your own\nI put beats to rhymes get peace of mind\nO-Z's to dimes and this weed is mine\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\n\nI hear niggas talking bout what they rolling up\nSmell what I smoke fore the bag open up\nGood chance if you see me then I'm smoking one\nLicensed to get it from the men who grow the shit\nReal nigga blowing weed before I was old enough\nIf I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it\nHit up Willie said dog I got some hoes to fuck\nI'm a fall through with an ounce of that potent shit\nDon't trip nigga we gonna all sip blow the whole zip\nLet you hit mine plus you supplying your own lil bit\nMy nigga get high and let the hoes twist\nSay you don't fuck with twists look how you rolled it\nThey ain't smoking like ours I'm rolling up paper they be burning for hours\nAnd if it's fire I'm smoking the whole thing entire\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\nThis weed is mine you can't have it\nThis weed is mine\nI got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me\nI wanna smoke with you do you wanna smoke with me\nI got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me\nI wanna smoke with you do you do you\n",
