Snoop Dogg
Doggumentary
2011)
I'm not down with the Republican Party
Or the Democratic Party
I represent the Gangsta Party
The Gangsta Party?
Yes, sir
I ain't no gang bang rookie, let that thang bang fully
I'm a boss out here on the West
Killa Coast is my home, rich rollin' on my throne
With my blue bandana on my neck
Girl, come fuck with Snoop
Sign up on my team, there's a little room left
Girl, you heard all my songs
Steady long, steady wrong, don't get yo' ass left
Church on the move, nigger
Now go and hit the turf with the news, nigger
I got some advice for you new niggers
You wanna be in the league, well, tell 'em who sent ya
Snoop, D-O-double G
Hoes with double D's in line to juggle these
Snoop, twistin' up the O-G
About a whole P until I O-D
Snoop, the one they all wanna come to see
Hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz
I hit the club, they all showin' me love
They like, "Snoop Dogg"
"Can I get yo' autograph?
What's up with that D.P.G., Doggystyle and Aftermath?"
I just laugh while I'm twistin' up another zag
Bad bitches kissin' in the tub, takin' bubble baths
I ain't no gang bang rookie, police tryin' to book me
I'ma modern day Tookie on the set
I got the whole party poppin', see you hater niggers
Jockin' all these ice cold diamonds on my chest
They see my whole team thuggin'
Now they mean muggin' but that don't mean nothin'
'Cause if it's a problem I pull the problem solver
Call it 38 revolver, put an end to all this drama
I'm top dollar with the gold flea collar
Get them girls, get them dollars, get them zeroes, get them commas
Yeah, it's time to get this change, guess I'm like Obama
But I'ma stay the same on my motherfuckin' momma, I'm
Snoop, D-O-double G
Hoes with double D's in line to juggle these
Snoop, twistin' up the O-G
About a whole P until I O-D
Snoop, the one they all wanna come to see
Hoes lovin' me, you niggers wanna be
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz
I hit the club, they all showin' me love
They like, "Snoop Dogg"
Two of the loc'est
Long Beach, Eastside's the place to be
Skinny side, lil' head honcho
Feel the young guap game
And you already know what it is
I ain't no gang bang rookie, y'all just tryin' to overlook me
Long Beach, Eastside when I ride, Skinny side get real low
And I tell them I got violent acts, son, I be shoppin' on the set
Let me hop on any hoe
Let a bitch hit me up for some brain blow
If nigger's didn't know, I'm 'bout cake though
D.P.G., Young Pilot fuck with Snoop
O.G. what a young man
15, got hated like a grown man
Weed money, that's me, who I fuck with
When I was young, my mom said I looked like
Snoop and we ridin' in a Coupe
And the top back, Doggystyle, bangin' out, motherfuckin'
Snoop, two-one, what it do?
I got an older chick, I'ma take to her my big homey
Snoop and I'm thinkin' crystal clear
Diamonds on my neck, shinin' like a chandelier like
Snoop, even Bloods fuck with cuz
Damn, I can't believe I'm in the club with big Snoop
Young Pilot
Snoop, are you still basically a gangster?
That's a figure of speech but you know, I like usin' that word
Is it G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R or G-A-N-G-S-T-A?
Say it, Larry, say it like you mean it, gangsta
Say it like you mean it, Larry, gangsta
