'64 on Vogue's\nIn the game pain still the same they knocking at your door\nOoo you wanna only talk bad\nIt's a sad sad thing you dirty low down\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nTell me now!\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nWon't you tell me now!\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nSnoop Dogg\n\nIndependent I'm in it been getting my cash right\nWalking through the day time holding my flashlight\nSpliff-ted High as I can ever be\nI'm lofted drifting on the memory\nMy style my tone my delivery\nMy Maze is Frankie Beverly\nHeavily influenced I do it like you can't\nI'm the weed to the Zag with the bag and a drink\nGet live that's five on the black hand side\nNow try to stay fly with a piece of pie\nI heard fish don't burn in the kitchen\nThe baby gangstas they get in the hood and on a mission\nYou pump em up they fuck it up\nNow what you need to do is toughen up\nNow thug it up what it do dog\nI thought you wanted to be like big\n\nSnoop Dogg\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\n\nWhen I get lost\nI feel like a boss\nShe will be my salvation\nWhen I feel lost\nWith nowhere to go\nShe'll be my inspiration\nShe never spends\nTime with her friends\nTells me she's mute without me\nAnd when things go wrong\nHer faith is strong\nI know that she'll never doubt me\n\nHey Snoop Dogg\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\nOoo\nI wonder wonder wonder what it do\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nTell me now!\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nWa la la la la la la la la la\nWon't you tell me now!\nWa la la la la la la la la la\n",
