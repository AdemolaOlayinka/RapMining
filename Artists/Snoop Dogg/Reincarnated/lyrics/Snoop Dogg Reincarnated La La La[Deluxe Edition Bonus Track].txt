Den I walk and I talk bout dis one
Den I laugh and go on to dat other one
Hey what you want, you can't getty, getty
And the problem will get real dready, dready
Who feels it knows, and I suppose that you’ll never know
Ohh, you’ll reap what you sow
Can’t plant the corn where the peas want fit grow, nooo
La la la la la la la la la la, oh yeah

See them hypocrites they come again
Demma spread dirty lies, them man no me friend
Though, a story like that happened
And the one who spilled on him will have a problem
Hey, who feels it knows, and I suppose them heart made out of stone
Hoo, you’ll reap what you sow but it the one well that you are bound to drop off
Who feels it knows, and I suppose that you’ll never know
Ohh, you’ll reap what you sow
Can’t plant the corn where the peas want fit grow, nooo
