so trife your life could disappear
and if you aint careful who you fuckin' wit nigga 
Now reappear come here come near so you can hear what I spit
So sick and tired of niggaz standin on that "G" shit 
and just because you on  starz wit some khakis
and think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me

and mine sold out ever since it came out

and led you upstairs upstairs to a room with 37 niggaz 
that was strapped up hatin' waitin' on you nigga you the victim
