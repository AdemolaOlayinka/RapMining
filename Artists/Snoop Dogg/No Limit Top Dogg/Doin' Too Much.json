That's real\nJust like baby right here, she doin too much\n\nNow if that nigga next to you got a rented car\nAnd he actin like it's his but you know it's not\nSay he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much\nAnd if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up\nShe actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up\nSay she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much\n\nI gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb\nI told em \"Hit the side and slide and get the herb\"\nBut guess who's callin, Pipedream Patty\nMade that nigga park my whoride beside the alley\nForget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)\nFuck that nigga yo\nBut I can't forget about him cuz he taught me everything I know\nOh no Joe, walkin down the wrong lane\nTootin on that cocaine, fuckin wit that wrong thang\nNiggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)\nThen fake the funk, doggonnit\nNow loc, look at this predicament\nYou smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit\nNiggas like you, used to be in my crew\nGoddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to\nI remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew\nThat's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce\n\nNow if you're doin for your family and you can't stand it\nCuz you know these mothafuckers tryin take advantage\nSay they doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much\nAnd if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope\nAnd he need to catch a mothafuckin different stroke\nSay he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much\n\nWe parlay, parlay everyday DPG style\nWe might throw a pool party every once in a while\nNow in fact we gon' do one this weekend\nLet's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in\nI believe in, sharin the cock\nAlso, I believe in comparin the cock\nLook, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)\nCuz she love the way I just beat up the pussy\nNot just knee deep, she was totally deep\nWhen she went down on me\nShe blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off\nOoh wee, baby you's a freak\nPut my homey up on game like a gangsta\nBut my homey fell in love and he banked her\nAin't that a trip? Now we in a twist\nBack in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist\n\nNow when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back\nAnd he get his third strike wit no get back\nSay he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much\nAnd when the homey in the pen, doin a sin\nAnd his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend\nSay she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much\n\nI'm livin up in the hills, wine sippin wit mills\nI'm havin major type of paper, I ain't trippin off bills (still)\nShow me some respect and accept my coolness\nAnd don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish\nUse this as a warning, cuz I'm startin\nTo figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin\nPardon me, cuz I ain't mad when you get bent\nBut I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?\nFriends and family, gettin after me like repo\nEat, smoke, choke then want me to throw em a c-note\nYou doin too much when you clutchin on my touch-tone\nCallin strays over nigga leadin months gone\nConversate for fo' hours, wastin mo' power\nAnd only get to hit a cold shower\nYou fakin like you're makin more moves than Simpson\nBut frontin, pushin buttons, doin nuttin but sin\n\nAnd when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin up yo' bill\nTryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel\nYou know he doin too much, yeah nigga you doin too much\nAnd when your baby momma cryin bout she need some milk\nAnd you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt\nYou know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much\nThat's real\n",
