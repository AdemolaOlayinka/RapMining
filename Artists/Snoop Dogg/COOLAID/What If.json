Don't do that!\"\nCome on, you know me, man\nI pimp on, I entertain, man\nThat's why I stay inside my lane\nI gotta be careful when I show you stuff\nCause these haters don't like you if you know too much\nYo, ow give it up if you like this\nAnd you prefer the peace\nAnd won't get mad if you don't have no one to fight with\nWe pull the cards around a phony\nMy sister told me, \"Niggas act hard around they homies\"\nBecause the West don't need no beef\nWe need our and our roaches\nAnd our Reres and our Monique\nSo stay prayed up, armor on, I got it\nWhat if you talked to that man\nAnd understood before you shot him?\n\n(What if?)\nThe Bloods and the Crips was the same\nAnd all niggas joined one gang\n(What if?)\nMy granny wouldn't have died\nMan, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side\n(What if?)\nYou could do what you don't\nAnd live how you motherfuckin' want, say that\n(What if?)\nA phony is a phony, a homie is a homie\nAnd you know the big homie don't play that\nCatch him, stick him\nRip it, ride it\nLa di da di, we shout out the party\nThe old me, the new you, you niggas tryna do me\nYou better off tryna do you\nBoo hoo, voodoo, taboo\nDP, GC, what it really do?\nI educate when I illustrate\nAnd those the words I be teachin', preachin'\nTo each and everyone\nNever been a scary one\nAlways been a down ass nigga, clown ass nigga\nReppin' my city,\nExtra extraordinaire exceptionally\nNever late, predicate, elevate, levitate\nMy nigga, I'm way too high to ever hate\nPapa Snoop in my momma Beverly, heavenly\nThank God for ya'll havin' me, for real\n\n(What if?)\nThe Bloods and the Crips was the same\nAnd all niggas joined one gang\n(What if?)\nMy granny wouldn't have died\nMan, I probably wouldn't have been from the East side\n(What if?)\nYou could do what you don't\nAnd live how you motherfuckin' want, say that\n(What if?)\nWe had a reckless motherfucker\nThat was king of west coast instead of big Snoop Dogg\n(What if?)\nWe never had a nigga like Big P\nFrom the Southside, nigga goin' \"woof\"\n(What if?)\nWe never had a real woman\nThat could raise us and teach us, show us what the real was\n(What if?)\nWe had to take it\nIf you didn't have Suga Free, motherfucker, you had to make it\n(What if?)\n",
