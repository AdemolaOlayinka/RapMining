My momma is on the call\nShot three lil pigs and now my back against the wall\nNowhere to turn and no where to go\nMy blood is burnin' I'm about to blow\nHuey, Malcolm and Martin, those are my peers\nThey been doin' niggas like this for over hundreds of years\nPoppin' us, fear, now it's time for us to clap back\nBut this time we gon' bust them the fuck back\nWe ain't runnin', we shootin' and lookin' forward\nAnybody, somebody, everybody on the floor\nThey just surrounded my place\nHold the court in the streets so I can win my case\nTEC-9's with a couple 45's\nAnd the revolution will be televised\n\nThe revolution, oh, oh\nWill be televised, will be televised\n(The revolution will be televised)\nThe revolution, oh, oh\nWill be televised, will be televised\n(The revolution will be televised)\nThe revolution-lution-lution-lution\nThe revolution-lution-lution-lution\nWill be televised\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nThe revolution-lution-lution-lution\nOh, la-la-la-la-da-da-da\nThe revolution, oh, oh\nWill be televised, will be televised\n(The revolution will be televised)\nThe revolution, oh, oh, na, na, na, na, na\nWill be televised, will be televised\n(The revolution will be televised)\n",
