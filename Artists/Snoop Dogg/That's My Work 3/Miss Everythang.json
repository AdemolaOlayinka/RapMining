    "lyrics": "Guten tag, Ich liebe\nIch keine\nOh mein God\nIch glaube kommen\nIch swear to God\n\nYou know my story\nI did a lot of balling\nBeen around the world\nA lot of girls calling\nA lot of panties falling\nOut the air and on the stage\nIf my life was a book\nYou wouldn't miss a page\nBut none of that really matters\nWhen I\nSeen her pass by\nI damn near dropped my folds\nI'm like Snoopy breathe\nKush had me gone\nI couldn't think straight\nPimpin' was all alone\nShoulda seen her walking\nLike a model do\nIf this was Twitter\nI would follow you\nOpen your world to new things\nLet Doggy take your hand\nI'm seeing wedding rings\nCall Diddy lets make a band\nShe got me hot\nI don't want to leave\nI seen the world's best\nBut she's something to see\nAnd now I'm on a plane\nFeeling so ashamed\nI couldn't catch her name\nI call her Miss Everything\n\nTell me have you seen her (Seen her)\nFive something, pretty face, and them big brown eyes\nSmall little waist\nWhen the floor goes tremble\nMake a grown man cry\nOooh\nI keep\nBut the numbers never got exchanged\nEvery town, every city\nGot a, a Miss Everything\nMiss Everything (Miss everything)\nYou know my story\nI rocked a lot of crowds\nSold millions of records\nI love my fans so loud\nI got a thousand cars\nAnd all hopes of bein'\nA real superstar\nI live super far\nBut none of that really matters\nWhen I caught my eyes in Spain\nShe walked into me\nLike you did your thing\nIn that Spanish accent\nThe one I love so much\nShe looked like an angel\nOne I wanted to touch\nI blinked my eye for a second\nAnd then she disappeared\nWhen I see that Pretty Woman\nI felt like Richard Gere\nBoss dog ain't never been one to watch it pass\nUnless we in they room, and they leave\nAnd I watch that ass\nBut baby something else\nSomehow I didn't speak\nI been a player so long\nMaybe I reached my peak\nAnd now I'm on a plane\nFeeling so ashamed\nI didn't catch her name\nSo I call her Miss Everything\n\nYah, you know my story\nI seen a lot of hoes\nA lot of gold diggers\nLuda call them pros\nI don't call them back\nAnd thats just how it goes\nMost people call me Snoopy\nOr S-N-double-O\nBut none of that really matters\nWhen I was in New York\nI had a show at The Garden\nYou know, poppin' corks\nThat's when I seen her\nFrom a distance\nShe smiled and froze\nNow everything I learned in the game\nTold me she chose\nAnd I don't miss a beat\nThis time I gotta speak\nShe looked magnificent\nLike something to eat\nHey co, I can't let her go\nI made my way through the crowd\nLet's get out of here\nHead to Filipe Childs\nLotta stars in place\nDoggy set the mood\nI'm like \"I like your style\"\nShe's like \"I like yours too\"\nBefore I\nI gotta know your name\nShe smiled as if she came\nCall me Miss Everything\n",
