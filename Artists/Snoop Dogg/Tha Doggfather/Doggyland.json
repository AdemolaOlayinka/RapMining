(What?)\nAnd niggas don't kill one another\n(Oh really why is that?)\nBecause a brother is a brother.\n(And what about the mothers?)\nThey queens,\nrighteous,\nman,\nheaven must be like this,\ngreen aroma like the grass in the summertime.\nAin't no peneteneries and ain't nobody doin' time.\nAnd oh yeah, I'm the big O-K'er,\nI'm smarter than the senator,\nBigger than the mayor.\nHeaven on Earth\nit's like a prayer.\nAnd you can't get in without yo' gold card you got\nto be a player.\nNow you know a place where\nYou gots to be and I took you there,\nPop goes the nine, we'll go right behind\nYou can slide off your shoes sit back and recline.\n",
