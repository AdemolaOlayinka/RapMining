The one and only\nDon Corleone, the big homey y'know me\n\nWell if it's on I guess it's bout time\nLet me slide into this OG rhyme\nI do mine the way I do mine\nand I takes my time when I'm droppin my lines\nI look around, I spot MC's (and they)\nall in the place (and they) all wannabe's\nTryin ta make their paper, tryin to do their thang\nbut to me they all tryin to say the same thang\nHow could you rap over *?be said what?*\nYou ain't reachin the crowd, you ain't makin your fact\nYou ain't droppin lines that hit the top\nYou can't make the party go hip-hop\nabd you can't do your thing without usin mine\nWe get and steal, I see you're on the grind\nbut I'ma take my time to get my point across\nand if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost\nand if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault\nSee I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song\nI just move on, groove on, try to prove on\nthen I do mines to do mines and I'ma keep on, keep on, keep on\nto get'cha you in a...smooth type of atmosphere\nSit back and pay attention yeah\nYou ain't never heard it like that\nUhh, is that right? That's right black\nbut uhh,\n\n\n\nSixx minutes (sixx minutes), sixx minutes (sixx minutes)\nSixx minutes Doggy Dogg you're on\nUh uh on, uh uh on\nExcuse me Doggy Dogg you're on\n\n\nI gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they\neven trippin on me? Yeah the big homey\nGamey Gamey says \"Snoop Corleone\nlisten to me man, stay away from them phoneys\nIt's niggas like that that get you caught up quick\nYou gots ta stay focussed Dogg, keep your eye on your grip\ncos if you slip they gon' get'cha and they gon' get'cha fast\nThese niggas out for your money man, they tryin to get your cash\"\nI don't give a damn, you gots ta match\nYou can be from the East Coast and get love cos I ain't trippin on your ass\nI don't smash on niggas who are smaller than me\nI smash on niggas who big like the DPGC\nOoohwee, I get'cha crazy\nYou gots ta have a stomach for this shit, ba-by\nAnd if ya don't you won't, you fake the funk\nSee Snoop is the G in the G-Funk\nNow don't do nothin that you can't get out of me\nUh uh, you know I got big love for the real G's\nWe make mo' G's, I gots ta have it\n\n\n\n\n\nI got the, I got the, I got the paper\nI keep ya, I keep ya, I keep ya cryin\nI thought ya, I thought ya knew my nigga\nYa better, ya better ask somebody (Better ask somebody)\n\nUh, it don't quit\nNow let me take my time and just get into the shit\nI'm just driftin, so swift and smooth\nHow many niggas make the whole party move like I do?\nI can't name nobody\nso sit back relax and let the Dogg rock the party\nAin't no party like a DP party\ncos everybody in the DP party's naughty\nThey acts a fool, old school, new school\nEverything is everything, everybody playin cool\nAin't no set trippin, everybody just dippin\nBitches gettin with niggas and niggas gettin bitches\nIt's all superb, word to my momma\nAin't no drama, no need for that\nYou can put your gat back in your pocket\nunlock it cos Snoop Dogg is on the mic, I plan to rock it\nDon't stop, (excuse me Doggy Dogg you're on)\n",
