(Beeyatch!)\nI come thru with the humps, I thump tha shit out'cha block\nI'm on alert for the cops, be on alert for the cop\nSpot us some hos, tooted my horn at the bitch\n??? ever skaty, my team ya's the shit\nFifteen's humpin, dropped the top, she moaned\ncountin my dough, purchased a 50 of some bomb indo floss\nIn South Central I'm on my way to the East Side\nWe high, blazin like crazy, we don't know why\nfeelin good as fuck on a hot ass day\nand it's a pujam right around the way\nNiggas got hos but ladies in the world\nthey wanna play wit their minds like little girls\nI twirled my fingers in the air\nrubbed my fingers thru my hair\nRed bones to black bones\ndark bows to red bows\nSkinny girls come a dime-a-dozen\nbut I play hos like plenty-leany cos I get greedy\nIt's all about game cos when the game\nis hard to maintain for so long, man\nFrom Long Beach, California, from Tulsa, Oklahoma\nTonight *?warnin the award is?* from Mississippi, I know ya\nhold the key to unlock the door\nFrom long clothes she rolls with gold thangs we ridin for sure\nSo tell me how much money can one playa make? (make)\nand how much o' ya ass can one nigga break?\nYou're just a gigolo (you know)\nTo the heart you're just gigolo (you know)\n\nI was off in Vallejo\npullin hos like Idaho potatoes\nWhat am I to do when life as a G\nbein from where I be, DPG\nIt's manifico\nran into this pretty ass skirt, Mexican-Puerto Rico\nmixed with a sprinkle of black\nSo I'ma approach her like dat\nand let her know where I ride and reside at\nMy zone the place that I call home\nis the Wall from Philadelphia, the room\nPicture me ay\nentrepenuer with my nigga D-A\nRockin tours and we still young boys\nThey got bitches, they got some bomb ass niggas\nShe used ta put em on his bomb ass dick\nShe always talked some bomb ass shit\nShe used to blow some bomb ass dick\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's right\nSomeone's at my door, baby who could it be?\nSomeone wants to score and get laid by the D-O-double G\nHey girl, what's your name? Ya wanna go a couple rounds with me\nI told her Nate Dogg is just the same but she kept screamin out Snoopy\n\n\n\nWhat's up baby, my name is Warren\nI'm down with the Pound\ncos I get around\nSo let me scoop you, swoop you and take you\nGimme a chance and I'ma break you\ndown to the very last compound\nwith my homies from Tha Dogg Pound\n\nNow you know and I know\nRule number one, you can't trust no ho\nNow you can get caught up in the mix real fast\nThe ho gon' slip away and get away with all your cash\nYou got to stay upon your toes when it come to hos\nI bust a brand new ho in every video\nThat's on the Pound and the Row when the wind blow\nI pass a ho to my kinfolk\nand then smoke\nShe say she was no groupie, coochie lookin juicy\nShe say she never ate a dick before but she gon' do me\nRight before she do me, I blaze up a lupi\nthen turn on some Snoopy and, uhh, heat up jacuzzi\nand later on I might just turn on a movie\nso you can regroupie and redo me just for Snoopy\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's roaches and shit in this motherfucker in here\nI forgot about this\n",
