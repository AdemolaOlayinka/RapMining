They droppin doo-doo\nI'm steppin on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe\nSee I'm smashin full-breaded wit no leash\nWhen I mob, make marks across the street\nSee I'm vicious like hell, got em waggin they tail\nfor the bow-wow LBC style\nHit you like the Dogg bopper fever, I fetch paper\nOn the receiver, go get it like a retriever\nI want em close enough so I can lock on em\nwit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on em\nCheck this out here man, I lick em, sick em\nMan's bestfriend, I hit you for ten, uhh\nFleas can't seize my pack, what what's my name?\nMajor trick we're hittin licks like a doberman gang\nY'done trip and try to fuck me up ever since a young puppy\nRun a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG\n\n\n\nAll I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all\nJust keep it real Dogg\n\n\nThey say once upon a time in the land of the loccs\nwhere it's all about dope and pistol smoke\nI packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver\nWe'd out, Dp'd out, GC'd out\nOh, did you not know\nSnoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door\nWe the passion for smashin and mashin the masses\nKnockin niggas llike cash is, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin\nIt's like in a action\ncos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin\nBustin, no need for discussion\nWe don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust\nclose enough to touch then rush\nClean and radical and get clutch\nThe Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone\nfor the D-O-double G (with the solid gold rhyme)\n\n\n\nJust keep it real Dogg\nAll I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all\n",
