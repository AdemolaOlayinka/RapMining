    "lyrics": "Can you feel it, nothing can save ya\nFor this is the season of catching the vapors\nSince I got time, what I'm gonna do\nTell ya how it's spreading throughout my crew\nWhat you want on Nate Dogg\nWho sings on my records, 'Never Leave Me Alone'\n'Ain't No Fun', now check it\nBack in the days before Nate Dogg would get it\nHe used to try to holler at this girl named Pam\nThe type of female wit fly Gucci gear\nShe wore a big turkish wole wit a weave in her hair\nWhen they tried to kick it, she'd always fess\nTalkin about baby please she wrought his service stress\nSince he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer\nThe homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her\nBut now he wear boots that match with his suits\nAnd push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap\nAnd now she stop flautin and won't it speakin\nBe comin round the Pound every single weekend\nto get his beeper number she be beggin please\nDyin for the day to eat these\n\nShe caught the vapors\nShe caught the vapors\n\nI got a little cousin that's kinda plain\nHe bring the heeb wit tha beep for the Dogg Pound gang\nA mellow type of fellow best laid back\nBut back in the day he wasn't nuthin like that\nI remember when he used to scrap every day\nWhen my auntie would tell him he would never obey\nHe wore his khakis hangin down wit his starks untied\nAnd a blue and grey cap that said the Eastside\nAround my neighborhood tha people treated him bad\nSaid Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had\nThey said he grow up to be nuttin but a gangsta\nOr be there in jail or some other shaker\nBut now he's grown up to be a surprise\nD-A-Z got a hit record slangin world wide\nNow the same people that didn't like him as a child\nBought the Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle\n\nThey caught the vapors\nThey caught the vapors\n\nI got another homie from tha L-B-C\nKnown ta yall as D.J. Warren G\nHe cut grass trasform wit finesse\n......... and all that mess\nI remember when we first started to rap\nHe tried to get this job at Calvin's record shop\nHe was in it to win it, but the boss front and said\nSorry Warren G but there's no help wanted\nNow my homie Warren still tried\nOn and on and on til the like break of dawn\nTo work at tha V-I-P would be the link\nBut they looked right past him so my homie straight dip\nNow for the year after Regulate\nWarren G is havin papers so my homies write straight\nHe walked into the same record shop as before\nAnd the boss be like Warren welcome to my store\nOfferin him a job but nah he don't want it\nDamn it feels good to see people love Warren\nCause I remember when at first they wasn't\nNow guess what they call sessy bussin\n\nthe vapors\nThey caught vapors\nI got to talk bout me now\n\nLast subject of tha story is about Snoop Dogg\nI had to work for mine to show I was a true hog\nWhen I was a teenager I tried to be down\nAnd since they wasn't tryin to hear me I made the Dogg Pound\nI saw a crew on 2-1 street\nand said, 'Can I be down champ?' They said\nno, and treated me like a wet food stamp\nafter gettin rejected, I ain't runnin upset\nI said, 'What's a Dogg do to?' Rhymes at rates\nWhen I used to go to parties, they make me wait\nWhat I have to get on the mic to set M-C straight\nI ain't never love no hoe since I'm listenin to my music\nThey acted like I wanted to keep hangin with the juzi\nBut now things switched from West to East\nShort Dogg do ya remember me from 21st street G?\n'We used to see Daz, back in the day'\nIt happens all the time, so brother don't be amazed\n\nYou caught the vapors\nYou caught the vapors\nYou got the papers\n",
