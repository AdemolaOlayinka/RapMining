Whatup fool\nNow you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha\nAnd once my small kitchen ?throw?\nYou know I gotcha\nWatch out, no need to pull your glock out\nIt's a players affair, now\nLook at my hair and the girls wit me\nThey got the same thang on\nPimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on\nCoz my uncles about to get their sang on\nAnd all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song\nAnd when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'\nkeep it ballin'\n\n\nHe starts to mill\nJust rollin' tru his town\nStacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)\nRaising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)\nBecasuse he's loved\nLoved in every city\nThats why he's ballin'\n(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')\nYeh ballin'\n(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')\n\n\nThere it is coz it is there\nNow have a seat and come hit the game from a player\nThey say time brings change and change brings time\nIt's so genuine and so divine\nIt's been so long in fact its overdue\nNow tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you\nI fell for you, I'll always look over you\nTheres really not much that a player would'nt do for you\nSo quit stallin' and fallin'\nAnd come get a bar of some of this ballin'\nNow quit stallin' and callin'\nAnd come get yaself a bar of this ballin'\n\n\nYeh thats right, this is ahh, radio station 187.4 DG\nSock it to your ass\nWith something from The Dramatics\nAnd Snoop Dog\nLet them spot that ok\nIt's another one of those world premiers\nDoin' it to ya doggystyle, in ya air hole\nfor the 2000 plus 1, yeh\n",
