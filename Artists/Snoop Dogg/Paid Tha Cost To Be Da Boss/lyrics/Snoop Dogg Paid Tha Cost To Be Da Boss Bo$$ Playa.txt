Skin and game, cheah


Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it aint no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple, cause you know its played
Holla at 'em Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang (go ahead)
Ok son, I'll tell ya like my nigga "Pootie Tang"
I got that bounce, to make her booty swang
That little cutie thang, 'fraid she's a beauty bang


Rollin' with a player cause thats what he was
And dedicated to his paper, Jesus
On his bitches (hard as feeds uck)
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say its cheaper to keep her, now baby ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treesa
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her
I'll take the stronga, you can have the weaka
Speak when spoken to, yeah I broke a few
And by the way I was hoping you
Had a freak for me and a freak for you
I make 'em do for us
The thang you been wantin' her to do for months




This is the Chairman of the Board ..
The archbishop Don Magic Juan ..
Big Snoop Dogg .. is a boss playa
As a matter a fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', cheah


I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout, before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it homie I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith
Fuck straight




Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever)

Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)


Big Snoop Dogg, lets you know ..
That this game ain't for no lame ..
If you got heart, you can play this game
But if your heart ain't right
We got a remedy for that, too
You gotta go see the wizard .. to get you some heart
And the archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard
That's got the game .. for them lame
Boss Playa .. Boss Playa .. that's what this gang is all about
Boss Playa




Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?
Round the corner messin' with brothanem
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends
I don't think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Always in them stores, with major whores
Doin' things, bling bling
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' in the green
With the sticky in yo hand fo sho
Everybody round ya cause  they know you got mo'
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild
You like to dip in yo sexy shit
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT
L.B.C. rollin' with me, ohh
