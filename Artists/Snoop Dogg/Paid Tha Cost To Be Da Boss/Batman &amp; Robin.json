I think these clowns need to back down\nLet's be the Gap Band and drop the bomb on 'em and make 'em SCAT man\n(When you say scat man, like the brother called brother) Uh-huh\n(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner cover)\nWe can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger\nGo get The Riddler, to watch me play that nigga like a fiddler\non a hot tin roof, I got them watchin who?\nShe who spits it like she was sippin rot-ten brew, ooh\n(We Marvel at you Comics, you ain't no Superhero)\nYou just a stupid zero, you ain't hard like DeNiro\n\n\nSurprise! The Dynamic Duo\nBatman & Robin, gats set for squabbin (nigga!)\nSplat! Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)\nPlat! Means more than one million sales\nThat's nuff shot to lick, you get done up\nPlus we got the Bat gats, so why would you run up?\n\n\"Batman! Batman! Batman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, when it's beef in Gotham City I, gots to flip and\nHit 'em with the POW! BAM! BIFF! Whoa\nPick up your lips, don't trip, tie your shoelace\nWhen I spit, I split it, turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face\nRobin, I'm more than a sidekick, I'm more like the livest\nThey wanna go head up and collide\nAnd like collision, hope your moms made provisions\nSee you ain't got no wins baby, not even a smidgen\nMad hostility dealt, now I'ma really be felt\nSwitch on my utility belt, make yo' facility melt\nI go Mad on yo' Hatter, watch yo' whole shit splatter\nGet, wicked on yo' case like Detective Van Adder\nSo the, sayin goes, if you snooze you lose\nTrust you do, me and Batman the Dynamic Two!\n\n\n\n\nCold day in Gotham in the Bat Cave chillin\nCatnip for Catwoman so she caught the feeling\nHuh, talk about flavor for a Pringle\nA favor for a favor maybe later we can mingle\nDamn, just then, the Bat Phone ringin\nThey hoo-bangin' in Gotham, I got to do my thing\n\n\nBatman! War is on the brink\nIt seems that the Penguin is causing a stink\nCall up Robin quick, you know what to do\nAdd dye to the water and splash the town blue\n\n\nShit I'm there in a flash, Batmobile on 3's\nTrust me buddy, got heat for Mr. Freeze\nAnd Clayface will catch the em-brace\nof napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb\n.. and don't you forget it\nTakin out you suckers and you don't know how I did it\n\n\nNo one, can save the day like Batman\nRobin, will make you sway like that and\nBeat for beat, rhyme for rhyme\nDeep in Gotham, fightin crime\nNo one, can save the day like Batman\nRobin, will make you sway like that and\nBeat for beat, rhyme for rhyme\nDeep in Gotham, fightin crime\n\n\nDirty Dinkins Batman!\nDid you see those crispy khaki creases on that rugged wretched..\n\n\nAiy-yo-yo-yo kick back Robin\nGet Alfred and tell him to have barbecued buffalo wings\nand a pitcher of Kool-Aid on chill\nIt's about to get real in the field\n\n\nLeapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That's a no-no!\nLet's hop out this fo'-do'!\n\n\nYea yea yea, systems engaged\nStart the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches\nYou ready Robin? Let's dip\n\n\nLet's, dip! Holy Hoodrat Sally smokin crack in the alley\nLet's, dip! I mean, crazy kinfolk in Kingsville Batman!\nWe must, we MUST Batman, listen to me\nHoly Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that come with it\nAnd potatoes on top with gravy in the middle\nGod damnit Batman!\n\n\"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da--da-da-dah - BATMAN!!\"\n",
