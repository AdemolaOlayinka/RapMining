You talk too much\nHoe get up out my face unless you tryin to fuck\nCause on the real a nigga kinda drunk\nAnd right now the way you lookin bitch you fly as fuck\nI don't even know if I done had too much\nYou play too much, I had to fuck\nCuddled you up and put my hands on your butt\nRubbin your stuff and now your pants full of nut\n.. You can't tell me nuttin\nLet me shoot my thang on your bellybutton\nI got to, keep it gangsta\nYour homegirl want some, I just might bank her\nShank her, bank her, and take her bankroll\nBig Snoop Dogg and my game is way cold\nNever, ever, overexpose\nI usually got a car with a room full of hizzoes\n\n\nSnoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\nSoopa-Duper, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\n\n\nNow bitch, check it out, where my money, c'mon break it out\nJust sayin hoe, I ain't playin c'mon, take it out\nDick down the track, c'mon, we gon' work it out\nStraight pimp shit we on, we gon' church it out\n(If you don't know) I'm quick to change up stick\nMy dick in yo' mouth and aim up\nOpen up your eyes you'll see my navel\nFlip down my drawers, you'll see that label\nSniffed so much 'caine/Kane, the bitch got able/Abel\nPut the switch on, directed my cable\nSplash! What head work and what ass\nBitch stop my dick hurtin, now fuck Daz\nRun fast if I tell ya bitch walk\nGet caught, I'm takin all that bitch got\nI don't need no relationship\nAll I really had in mind was my dick, yo' face and lips, c'mon\n\n\nSnoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\nHovi Baby, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\n\n\nYoung! Woo! Hov'! Yes\nShe wanna meet the only king on the East coast\nHook me up witcha boy Snoop she said he so low\nI never get the chance to get at him\nOnly on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah\nListen here madam, you can throw the pussy at him\nIf it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!\n.. Hov ain't into backwards mackin\n.. How backwards that is\n.. I don't love 'em though\n'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most\nIf she's, sneakin in the club with the toast\nI'm flyin the friendly skies with 36 hoes\nShit, I can get a chef to cook for me\nTalk about some paper if you tryin to book me\nMa, you can keep your head\nI got, expensive habits that need the bread\n\n\nSnoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\nSnoopy, ooh-wee, you so fly\nCan I give you a little piece of the pie?\nShake it, bake this thing for me\nCause you just flow so viciously\n\n\"Let's go do the bump.. give me that funky stuff\"\n\n\nI like the way you shakin that ass, so don't stop\nSlang that ass like I used to slang rocks\nBend over trick let me get to that spot\nLater on you can lick on my lollipop\nI like the way you shakin that ass, so don't quit\nYou know you get a hella response from my dick\nDon't put your fuckin clothes back on 'til you rich\nThe type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch!\n",
