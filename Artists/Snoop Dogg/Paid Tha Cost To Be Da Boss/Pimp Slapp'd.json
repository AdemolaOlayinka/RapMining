I fucked all your groupies\nWhen you was doin time in Camp Snoopy\nWith the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches\nAnd you was payin niggaz off with all my riches\nYou so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?\nOh I know (bitch!)\nBut I walk the mainline everytime I go down\nYou can check my G files I do it L.B.C. style\n.. I got the word on your Simon\nYou need to just start rhymin\nCause you the biggest star on your label\nAnd them other niggaz just crumbs off my table\nYou're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop\nAnd I still ain't been paid, for \"1-8-7 on a cop\"\nI started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit\nif you keep talkin shit on Crip!\n\n\nIt all boils down to the fact\nthat you're jealous of my paper stack (jealous ass nigga)\nIt all boils down to the fact\nthat you're jealous of my paper stack (gon get pimp slapped)\n\n\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\nHeaters, I keep em, bitches I got em\n\n\nIf I shoot you, I'll be brainless, and you'll be famous\nAnd I'll be spending money out the anus\nYour only gain is to try to get me to fall down to your level\nMan you worser than devils\nAlotta niggas should've said it, fuck em\nBut Ima say it for em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for em\nThis nigga's a bitch like his wife\nSuge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life\nAnd I'ma let the whole world see\nCos you fucked up the industry, and that's on me\nWe can go head up, nigga, set it up\nOr we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up\nYour rappers and artists, tell em, shut it up\nCos I'll fuck every last one of em up, especially Kurupt\nSee that's my lil homeboy, so he knows what's up\nHe better keep it Crippin, and slip his clip in\nCos these niggas trippin, this is official business\nDo the same way, leave no witnesses\nThis is that unexpected diss directed, sprayed, covered and protected\nStrip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it\nIt's all to the good again\nYou can catch Snoopy Dibby Double in the hood again\nSpinning that real times, spitting that real shit\nTo make the whole world feel it\nSo put the bacon in the skillet, and try to peel it\nCause Doggystyle Records is the realest, nigga\n\n\n\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\nHeaters, I keep em, bitches I got em\nMoney, I get it, paper I got it\n\nJealous ass nigga\n",
