Let's get it crackin' (fuckers)\nLook, I was young, I was broke\nHad no hope, so I wrote, that's how I cope\nI went hard with no results\nNew approach, same truth\nJust get ready, aim, shoot, then get buried, bang, woof\nSo they better bring troops because...\n\nI came here to raise hell, I can't lie\nOne shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hired\nYou won't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die\nNever get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire\nCause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye\nBetter back the fuck up, over guns so I try\nNow that weak shit, we'll never slide, I despise\nYou are now not in the presence of nice guys\n\nIt's fuckin' murder, baby\nI'm tryna hurt 'em, baby\nI know you heard me, baby\nFeel like I'm goin' crazy\nIt's fuckin' murder, baby\nRun, run, run, the cops almost got me\nAnother tear drop, another fuckin' body\nUh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body\nUh, uh, uh, another body\nUh, uh, uh, another body\nUh, uh, uh, another body\nUh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body, body\n",
