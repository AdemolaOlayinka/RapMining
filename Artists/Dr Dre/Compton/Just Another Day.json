Compton\"\nProduced by a billionaire in this motherfucker\nStill smoking, Dre we need a ceiling in this motherfucker\nCompton!\nThey're killing in this motherfucker\nThey're drilling in this motherfucker\nLock the door, they're stealing in this motherfucker\nNo chains, no reins, this my home\nNigga this hub city, no fly zone\nNiggas pull out burners, start breaking like turbo on ozone\nCrack fiends on the back streets\nWhere the tracks lean and the needles lay\nAnd switchblades, if you bitch made\nPut chili all on your Frito Lay's\nWhere we dream of Montego Bay\nBut all we got is the swap meet\nWhere the cops meet, go bang bang\nLeaves blood stains on the concrete\nAnd I'm the only nigga bumping Mobb Deep\nCause I mob deep down that side street\nI'm a west side rider, gats on collars\nDon't hate me, better get your dollars\nI be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands\nLeaning on that bro hand\nFlame dump like a co-tail with my name on it\n\nAnother day in Compton, the thrill is high\nKnow somebody's watching, but I don't know why\nFeel the fire burning, it touches the sky\nFeeling coming at you, I won't die tonight\nSo I get by, I get by\nI get by, I get, I get by\nCause it's just another day in Compton\n",
