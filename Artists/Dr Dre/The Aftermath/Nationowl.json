That shoe you tryin ta wears, not fittin\nNow we're strippin niggas like a Chippendale\nI'm rippin hell, burnin the devil and inhale\n\n\n\nIn the last days, which side will you be on?\nNationowl's on the side that I beat on\nI demand put me on\nFrom the door I use MC's to wipe my feet on\nMy shit be bumpin like in-grown hair\nFor twenty-six years trained in ghetto warfare\nNigga, I see more green than St. Patrick\nPro actors, game of life with no practice\nControllin craps like I had a remote\nIt's a rule, now go enter ya tomb\nNo joke, much over I scold\nIt's some game for all who's tryin ta split ya coats\nBest believe that these are our last years\nPrepare or get done from the rear\nAs we move there, where? The final frontier\nUnited we stand, divided we don't have a prayer\n\n\n\nAre you wit me East Coast?\nAre you wit me West Coast?\nAre you wit me?\nAre you wit me?\nAre you wit me West Coast?\nAre you wit me East Coast?\nAre you wit me?\nAre you wit me?\n",
