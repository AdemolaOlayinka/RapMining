KRS-One from the Bronx kid!\n\nEast coast (killer), West coast (killer)\n\nWelcome to the New World Order\nYou are now under martial law\nAll constituional rights have been suspended\n\n\n\nThe most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this\nCoast trippin goin on through out the business\nEast Coast West Coast anybody killer!\nI don't give a fuck where you from I'ma Killa Hill-er\nI got crews on both sides together\nDeeper than the ocean and down for whatever\nFool I can roll through any block\nfrom Central to Westland Avenue, without my glock\nBut some niggaz can't survive on both sides\nSo they try and break off, eliminate ties\nFools got to get wise, better realize\nTrue, enemy lies killin in the highrise\noffice, analyzing the song\nLook at them red niggaz, don't even get along\nKill that noise, four niggaz bringin the skill\nMad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill\n\nYeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy\nThe mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know\nYou're not ready to rumble or test this\nKill that noise!\n\nEast coast (killer), West coast (killer)\n\n\n\nNow when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan\nDesert Storm in this modern day Babylon\nI be the twelve disciples strap arms\nAll black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone\nLike a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm\nSilent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on\nFocus on your rap holsters, notice\nI'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts\nFerocious thoughts, are mergin at night\nLike Jehovah towards the virgin in white\nI'm wrapped in a turban for spite\nLike a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up\nWhen the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up\nIt's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real\nto make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal\nlike Heavy Heel, but what's the fuckin deal?\n\nEast coast (killer) West coast (killer)\n",
