Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions\nI be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings\nSo what the fuck am I supposed to do?\nI pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)\nA heartless bastard, high and plastered\nMy style is like the reaction from too much acid - never cool down\nPass it around if you can't handle it\nHang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates\nWhat's the difference between me and you? (What?)\nAbout five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles\nUntil my death, I'm Bangladesh\nI suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left\nYo that's the difference\n\n\nAight, hold up hold up!\nSTOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say\nDre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me\n(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg\nI got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit\nRiiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it\nBut I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch\nI mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?\nWell if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is\n\nWell that's cool, and I appreciate the offer\nBut if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma\nI'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her\nAnd cruise around wit her for seven hours through California\nAnd have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner\nat the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her\nRaw dawg, get your arm gnawed off\nDrop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of\nFuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up\nGet shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up\nand they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water\nThat's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product\nThat's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!\nYou better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!\nSo what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis\nOr we can scream, \"I Just Don't Give a Fuck,\" and see who means it!\n",
