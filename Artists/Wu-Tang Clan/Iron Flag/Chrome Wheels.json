Sunn) 12 O'Clock\nTwo On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)\nI love my brother to death\n(That old hip-hop, catch this)\n(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)\n\n\nI love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest\nShared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest\nA bitch named Celeste\nI met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check\nShe had some big ass breasts\nI had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets\nA nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best\nRemember grandmother live on Louis and Lex\nI remember Dirt Dog crashed his white Lex\nI remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck\nRemember Portland had Clyde Drex'\nRemember 12 O'Clock is a vet\nBig Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash\nI move like days in a week\nNiggaz don't know the face and names on my teeth\nNiggaz carry a cold piece, and separate the heat\nAin't scared of the motherfuckin police\n\n\nYo, yo\nGuns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab\nSix niggaz, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags\nOne toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic\nAnd two niggaz hooked on pussy\nAnd in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons\nAnd learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson\nStill cut class and played hookey\nThrew freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies\nRolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks\nBig forehead, had ears like Spock\nHe was mightier than a truckload of gats\nAnd bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat\n\n\nWhat up kid? Stay livin\nSeen you look good, you look live in ya linen\nAnd you survived ninth innin\nThe hood got us off the prop without women\nAll my niggaz that ride that provide to the end of this\n\n\nAin't nothin but the real, yeah\nAin't nothin but the real\nAin't nothin but the real, yeah\nMillion dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels\n\n\nYeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)\nThis one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh\n\nWe gamble the dice, remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life\nWhile the we rumble with the foul and trife\nShots fired on the block in threes like Glen Rice\nMade men think twice about the sacrifice\nBlack on white, write it for the world to hear\nWrite it for my fam who not here who do care\nGlance and stare, why when you can't compare?\nFrom the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair\nMove rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare\nBass and drums, see my face in the slums\nPedia Brown, media surround my sound\nWhen you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound\nSample with black, criminal, mechanical rap\nAssemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat\nTwo On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, \"Who Dat?\"\nTwo with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that\n\n\n\n\nTwo On Da Road, Bobby Digital\nHe's a gangsta, yeah\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nLive it up, live it up\nOh, no, no, no, no, no, no\n\n\n\n\nBang us in ya Jeeps\nShaolin! Bobby Digital\nUh-huh, Sunn who?\nYeah\nHaha! Yeah!\nGet that money y'all\nGet that money y'all\nGet that money y'all\nShout in pain\nUh-huh, yeah\nWeed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin\n",
