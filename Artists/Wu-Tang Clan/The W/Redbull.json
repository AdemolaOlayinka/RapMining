Don't panic\nDo I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?\nHell nah! I won't tell you son\nIf I find a wack ID I sell you one\nDoc and Hot Nick, Inspectah\nMy lecture's like Hannibal Lecture's\nWhere's the ketchup?\nDon't speak on it, shut ya trap\nI see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks\nAh woo, Doc in my own zone\nYou say you got the rapgames on, but it's all wrong\nI ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softy-truck\nThen pull a Mack out a box and smoke hoes\nYeah, ya little fucks\nGimme ya fucking money!\n\n\n\n\nUhuh, check it\nI'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on\nPlaying with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?\nSomebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp\nIf ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn\nPro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's\nBy arid actions try MC's to get their roll on\nFirst issue got issues\nWhat is hiphop to Hot Nickles\nIt's like Funk Docter's snot tissues, word\nLook at my hand and get the third\nFinger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear\nNow that's what I call harcore, let's act fool\nMr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool\nI been shitty, I'm from the veils of the city\nAnd just because my outfit match don't make me pretty\nBaggy Dun Gurees, dick need room to breathe\nIn a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese\nAin't no rules to the game, if it hit we ain't planned\nIn your business like EPMD So What You Sayin'\nYou codesignin that bullshit yo man tryin\nChaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!\nSlugs flyin\n\n\n\n\nYo, ya\nCheck, the code echos from magazines to the big screen\nFo' wheel machines like ya wits scream\nKids fiend from the urban to sub-urban\nRoll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant\nWe roll longer than dice in a casino\nSilo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0\nBehind the tinted windows I lay low\nOn some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0\nBut now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty\nOn third time fellon just hit with over 30\nNo worries, style have em so thirsty\nFirst degree heats are quittin on me\nCold turkey, no mercy\nI bring the pain of a hundred migraines\nBut a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came\nBut first bring the cashburst, then the outburst\nMy surroundsound pound ya ear like ... curse\nI flex muslce outside I find a next hustle\nTrouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle\nEven the best buckle win\nI take it to the exteme\nIt gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get cream\nThis life\n",
