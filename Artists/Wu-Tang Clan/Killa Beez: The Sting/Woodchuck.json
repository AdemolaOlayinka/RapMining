Architect\nWill you still love me tomorrow? Holocaust\n\nRoyal Famous, blame us\nYo\nMy first whip be a Chrysler\nSo when you see me you say, \"Chrys' is comin\"\nIce numbin ya neck, throw one of those\nStrong notes, Indian pose, flat footed\nYo my back hearts, feel like them crumbled wings\nBless by the Heaven kings, my crown piece seven rings\nMoney to earn, money to burn\nGive some, lend some, take it, fuck it\nBe stingy off a stash if you have to\nNigga, what? Flip a pack of if you have to\nPassion, pawn the shit, ya highest bidder\nBuy from the streets, cop at wholesale price\nMotel models, go tell five-oh\nFive-oh follow the black El Dorado\n\nWho got that real shit niggaz blast to, bitches shake they ass to?\nHit you up with the hood when we pass through\nBlack Knights, Royal Fam got that hot shit (yo)\nTopless in the cockpit of my drop six\n.. in the cockpit of the drop six\n\nYeah, yo\nGive me beats like this I start burnin\nWack MC's, ya still learnin\nJust like punk cops that rotate on ya block\nMillions of people was gonna hear the North Stars shot\nWhile the worlds rock mental, I hold presidential\nBare essentials, Wu-Tang credentials\nMakin niggaz catch wind chills when my N.S. wind build\nNiggaz better get real\nEven though I stay pissy drunk, run with Kurupt\nIn a red mini van fed tinted, smokin on that spinach\nAll funny niggaz get planted\nI got that Long Beach shit like J. Bennett\nThe rest of y'all niggaz sound like women\nScared of my sword when it's given\nY'all niggaz better stop pretendin\nCuz the words like I'll speak, we'll keep 'em printed\nKill or be killed is what I'm representin\n.. representin\n\nYo, yo, check it, yo\nAs 7 clouds form the storm,\nI baffle Gabriel the archangel with death, death to\nhis first born, Earth mourns Wu Killa Beez on the swarm\nFrom the battleship throw darts that be acrid\nWe ninjas, we backflip with tactics of antrax\nArise like the novice from earth under canvas\nOf the Clan, fist to fist, kamikaze shock this\nLike Nazi documents Apache Helicopters strike down\nnear the bunker of the Glocksmiths\nShop the Dirty Weaponry, Tecs from the 70's\nGone With the Wind, I slung mines within\nMy men tackle dikes with the 7 deadly dicks\nNeglect my covenant, my government enslaves you to my\nHall o Double Justice and bloodstains your judgement\nso prepare to be slain by the truth\nIt's Blood for Blood When All Hell Breaks Loose son\nWu-Tang Killa Beez from Shaolin Europe\nBlack Knights, Royal Fam\nIt's Cilvaringz, on\n",
