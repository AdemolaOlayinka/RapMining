Projects, projects\nSlums, bums, ghettoes\nLarge sums, yo\nWe read it all in the fan magazine\nHookers, pushers, lead magazine\nI grew up in Queens around Pappy and 'Preme\nHave my own dreams, cop a Caddy and lean\nAnd Drag told me about the fans in rap\nAnd after that talk all we said was that\nI'ma keep pushin the trigger 'til ya head is back\nGet rich off my songs, the hell with crack\nAnd Jamel ran through every jail with raps\nTryin to push my voice on every reel and track\nAnd I don't give a fuck if the reel is wack\nI bring an old school MC feelin back\nAnd we still in the hood with gats\nAnd my goons ain't good with gats\nAnd where you think you goin with the wooden plaques?\nSee, it ain't just me, the whole Wu is back\nBut you don't know what to do with tracks\nAnd what can this industry do with trash?\nAnd what the fuck you gon' do for rap?\nI'ma do it for the kids, get a school, some cash\nFuck a chain, I'm jewel they ass\nLike why play if the game don't last?\n\n\nYeah...\nMy vultures are signed and blinded by money getters\nPlayers and pimps, ya ho chose me\nSupposedly, that's how the game go\nAnd ain't a difference in prison gats and ghetto walls\nThat's why we playin hard ball\nThis be perfections from my father's hustle\nShrimp and bustles and life's complicated puzzles\nGrew up under the Older Gods, sits there with Cee Allah\nCame from the same thug parts and drug parts as Tony Stark\nI understand that the industry be under-handed\nUnderground and under-lined\nThank God, word, it took me so long to get signed\nClimb out of a hell of a bind\nThat's why I still return around the way\nThrow a toast to ya nose and ask what's mine\nForward my emotions of a supreme rap artist\nSolomon Childs, New York protege\nI've now been discovered\nAdjusted, it was all in my kin, got me smothered\nWu-Tang for life, my brothers got me covered\nMillionaire, billionaire status\nBeef with police like Marshall and Onasis\nDealin wit uniqueness\n",
