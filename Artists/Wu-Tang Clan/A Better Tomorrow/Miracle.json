    "lyrics": "If a miracle, could save us from\nThe travesty, that we've become\nIf a million sons would stand as one\nWe will overcome, overcome\n\nThe whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world\nThe other day I had to bury my homegirl\nWrong place, caught one in her face\nPlus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake\nFor Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate\nIn this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape\n10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate\n2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8\nCatch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's\nAnd the police informer was your childhood friend\nIn the real world, gotta hustle for your dream\nExtend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam\nFor the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine\nSwing on the judge, take a couple for the team\nHe's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home\nStranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown\n\n\nAlive, seen things from the Godfather saga\nA Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author\nDrama at the opera, crime story novel\nTuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle\nMeeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical\nBravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo\nShotgun, the underboss of our main source\nOf interest, the black widow cocaine empress\nA princess rich from her family's inheritance\nNow let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks\nThat was missin' in the last shipment\nAt first, everything nice, everything routine\nJocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream\nBut on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen\nI noticed that his normal firm handshake shook\nIt wasn't steady when he squeezed\n\n\nHe went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish\nWearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters\nTo perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced\nThat pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it\nYou're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up\nIt's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly\nI'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted\nContemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit\nBut it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him\nHe violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now\nIt's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'\nWith a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'\n\n\nAllah let me lay in your arms\nHold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song\nThe exalted, the most benevolent\nThe knower of all, keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence\nThis Earth, my place of birth\nAs time went through the ages it got worse\nSicknesses, beheadings in Syria\nEbola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier\nMost foods ain't even real, the chip is here\nDeadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air\nDear God, it's been a minute since I cried out\nSince mama died, I never wild out\nWe need help like the phone's 'bout to die out\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me now?\nWe need a miracle\nDestroy the FDA for holdin' back cures so they can get paid\n",
