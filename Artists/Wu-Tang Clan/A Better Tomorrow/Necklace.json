    "lyrics": "Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble\n\nMy necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit\nThe guest list full of real niggas that's hectic\nThe charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts\nPalm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach\nKeep your eyes open for them strong on thieves\nOut here looking for ice to put in they teeth\nChain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef\nLike my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east\nFrom the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat\nBang bang, different robe every day of the week\n2 Angels, dinner plate, fat dollar sign\nUniversal flag on, nigga, I got shine\n\n\nI keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this\nRope is so ferocious, diamonds that shine in oceans\nKeep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits\nMake me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc\nIced out Cubans, exotic stones from Africa\nThis the real thing, big bling, the chain swing\nTry to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco\nJury truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey\nExhaust pipes coffin horse kicks\nACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous\nMy links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape\n40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy\n\n\nWhy you say that?\nIt's real, kill a nigga for this shit\nAha, yo relax sis\n\nDinner plates rings, smothered in 2 pounds of dope\nEric B on the cut when it blings\nScrubbin' chain down in Colgate, double edged bangers\nOn they hips I wait in the jaw break\nThe snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers\nWe got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers\nHey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace\nAnd I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list\nThat's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's\nDrawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger\nCrack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter\nCatch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter\nLucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba\nYou might as well do me now cause I will do ya\n\n\nGod-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79\nBright yellow and dense in its gift and shine\nStill the same when exposed to air and water\nLike when amongst thieves you travellin' across the border\nThe brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid\nThe message was lost in transmission\nThat's often in a free elemental form\nNuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm\nMalleable ductile metal on many levels\nGet you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble\nLieutenants and Generals move with criminals\nThe pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral\nThe scope is on the rope, claws on the table\nBrass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable\nAnd it's sold by the weight\nShaped into a plate with food on it\nThe hungry wolves lie and wait\n\n\nTu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!\n",
