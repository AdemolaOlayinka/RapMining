Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!\n\nGZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor\nRae, all those bad times is behind us\nGhost, put that mask on to remind us\nMethod Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest\n\n\nMy lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one\nMy recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture\nRainman mathematician, this city slicker\nFinest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty\nStrive with an army of winners and no pretenders\n(*One*) We live free and achieve more\nBut first we gotta win with no stale mate\nThe all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man\n\nAll my trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth\nLoot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot\nMy knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off\nLet's spray, M-A-S-T-A\nKing I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock\nI hold the mic snug, split a slug\nBlack ninja, mask and gloves\n",
