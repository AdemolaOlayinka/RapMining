    "lyrics": "Wake up... wake up\nWake up...\n\nWake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up\nThe motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up\nStraight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up\nMy peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us\nScreaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up\nBut that's just another trick to enslave us\nPush the minimum wages\nPut, put our fathers up in them cages\nThen watch out when mother struggled to raise us\nBut, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition\nThat doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion\nPriests, politicians gotta listen to opposition\nFrom my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in\nFrom my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in\n\nAllah said to save the babies from the cold\nPour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows\nStill, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed\nOld time religion will not bring us satisfaction\nWithout action now who can disagree with me?\nGod is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history\nThat you could show and prove to me\nBut still you face east and nod your head to me religiously\nI'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real\n\nThe world won't get no better\nIf we just let it be\nThe world won't get no better\nWe gotta change it yeah, just you and me\n\nPoor reparations, the Bush administration\nUnequality, martial law, segregation\nFalse hood, false teaching, false education\nNow's the time for us to come amongst this nation\nThey deceiving us, they don't believe in us\nThey believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar\nI'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters\nRipping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders\nNever worship the image if we were swine eaters\nI'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas\nWe in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever\nI'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons\nThat I recite with song\nTrying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?\nFor all my people that's out there persevering through the storm\nBlack fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong\nPenetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along\n\n\nWake up and realise the times\nThat we living in the world is getting more iller than ever\nThought we was chillin', striving change for the better\nBut it was a dream like Martin Luther\nHe had a vision that could move a mountain\nProtect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm\nAs-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam\nWe want justice, police supposed to protect and serve\nAnd then they shoot us down like wild animals\nThe nerve of them cold-hearted killers\nWith blue suits slaying our black youth\nThe earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled\nWe need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill\nLet me educate them, translate it meaning God's will\nIt goes all in together, together how we are\nTo stand with a plan, provided we down to fall\nAnd that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses\nTaught us all to think backwards\n\n\nWe gonna change the world\n",
