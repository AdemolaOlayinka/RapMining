    "lyrics": "Windshield, rappers are like gnats\nThey're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield\nFallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head\nAxe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead\nBong bong, put a hole inside your head\n\nWe keep it rugged\nWe keep it rough\nWe keep it real\nWe keep it raw\n\nHow come the streets don't want me to live?\nPlus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs\nBut the devil done poisoned my wiz\nI'm doin' this for my family and kids\nI'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy\nSaid it before but I don't think nobody felt me\nYo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me\nI'm on the verge of a whole new makeover\nMy fake friends, they can take it like a takeover\nI'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it\nGot enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked\nSick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit\nBid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit\nNiggas be wantin' my leftovers\nI'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers\nI burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion\nMurk that pigeon and I shoot the television\n\nGot that trey pound on you, run down on you\nHard boiled nigga, Clan top soil\nMy fam straight royal, I'm a die loyal\nWhen them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em\nI'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon\nFoundation strong, never ride a bandwagon\nAndrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction\nCops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'\nCriminal individuals up in here\nWild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer\nWeed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers\nSuweeee, I got all my niggas up in here\n\n\nImagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate\nOf a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist\nHeartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick\nThis is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick\n\nLifeless activity, constant movement\nBuyin' elasticity, such improvement\nSword held to where it collapses inward\nSpillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards\nRZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture\nCo-author rewrote the scripture\nMath worked from birth, doubled the net worth\nAmplified in the time machine of early Earth\nA two-way radio, simple yet complex\nReceivers, transmitters, interest to contacts\nThe emergence of the earliest atoms\nTransform to a level extremely hard to fathom\nSame soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics\nSame group on them large-scale dynamics\nA wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered\nGalactic matter served on a graphic platter\n\n\nOverachiever, power hungry overeater\nI95, whip fly like an overseer\nI'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager\nOr overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba\nI got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers\nMy sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater\nCan't push me over either, that go for dojas\nI ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure\nI'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up\nForget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote\nOne verse could turn your soul to ether\nIt's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha, Mr. Meth\n",
