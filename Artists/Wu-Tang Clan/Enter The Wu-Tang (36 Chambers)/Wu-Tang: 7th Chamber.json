Twin glocks!\nShake the ground while my beats just break you down\nRaw sound, we going to war right now\n\nSo, yo, bombin\nWe Usually Take All Niggaz Garments\nSave ya breath before I bomb it\n\n\n\nI be that insane nigga from the psycho ward\nI'm on the trigger, plus I got the Wu-Tang sword\nSo how you figure that you can even fuck with mine?\nHey, yo, RZA! Hit me with that shit one time!\nAnd pull a foul, niggaz save the beef on the cow\nI'm milkin this ho, this is MY show, tical\nThe FUCK you wanna do? More than Spike Lee's Do\nI'm like a sniper, hyper off the ginseng root\nPLO style, buddha monks with the owls\nSo who's the fucking man? Meth-Tical\nOn the chessbox\n\n\n\nYo, yeah, yo\nI leave the mic in body bags, my rap style has\nThe force to leave you lost, like the tribe of Shabazz\nMurderous material, made by a madman\nIt's the mic wrecker, Inspector, bad man\nFrom the bad lands of the killer, rap fanatic\nRepresenting with the skill that's iller\nDare to compare, get pierced just like an ear\nThe zoo-we-do-wop-bop strictly hardware\nArmed and geared cause I just broke out the prison\nCharged by the system - for murdering the rhythm!\nNow, lo and behold, another deadly episode\nBound to catch another fuckin charge when I explode\n\n\n\nSlammin a hype-ass verse til ya head burst\nI ramshack dead in the track, and that's that\nRap assassin, fastin, quick to blast and hardrock\nI ran up in spots like Fort Knox!\nI'm hot, top notch, Ghost thinks with logic\nFlashback's how I attacked your whole project\nI'm raw, I'm rugged and raw! I repeat, if I die\nMy seed'll be ill like me\nApproachin me, you out of respect, chops ya neck\nI get vexed, like crashing up a phat-ass Lex'\nSo clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage\nPeace, I'm out, jettin like a runaway slave\n\n\n\nYo\nYa gettin stripped from ya garments, boy, run ya jewels\nWhile the meth got me open like falopian tubes\nI bring death to a snake when he least expect\nAin't a damn thing changed, boy, Protect Ya Neck\nRuler Zig Zag, Zig-Allah jam is fatal\nQuick to stick my Wu-Tang sword right through ya navel\nSuspenseful, plus bein bought through my utensil\nThe pencil, I break strong winds up against your\nAbbot, that run up through your county like the Maverick\nCaps through the tablets, I gots to make the fabrics\n\n\n\nAre you, uh, ah, uh\nAre you a warrior? Killer? Slicin shit like a samurah\nThe Ol' Dirty Bastard VUNDABAH\nOl' Dirty clan of terrorists\nComin atcha ass like a sorceress, shootin' that PISS!\nNiggaz be gettin on my fuckin nerves\nRhymes they be kickin make me wanna kick they fuckin ass to the curb\nI got funky fresh, like the old specialist\nA carrier, messenger, bury ya\nThis experience is for the whole experience\nLet it be applied, and THEN DROP THAT SCIENCE\n\n\n\nMy my my\nMy Clan is thick like plaster\nBust ya, slash ya\nSlit a nigga back like a Dutch Master Killer\nStyle jumped off and Killa, Hill-er\nI was the thriller in the Ali-Frazier Manilla\nI came down with phat tracks that combine and interlock\nLike getting smashed by a cinder block\nBlaow! Now it's all over\nNiggaz seeing pink hearts, yellow moons\norange stars and green clovers\n",
