    "lyrics": "Check it, these cold days got me in a physical rage\nWalking through the dark path in this invisible maze\nMy individual is criminal but lyrical plays\nA big part in my life in this critical state\nApocolypse, twist up the bamboo\nSwine life I cant handle\nCock the mack candle, pop the Jack Daniels\nIm a shine like candles in a blackout\nYour guaranteed to fall before the last bout\nFuckin wit Ruthless you assed out\nThe size of these guns a make you pass out\nIm like hollow tips the way I blast out\nIts all revolving, too much problems, no solving\nAsk me what Im involved in, Im a say robbin and mobbin\nIm runnin this shit nigga joggin\nNo thanks for livin on Thanksgiving Im still starvin\n\nYo, Im not new to this, Im true to this\nWhat you gonna do to lips?\nMan if I tell you one more time Ive been doin this, mound u loopbp\nRuthless be wettin these clowns up\nYo partner turn that sound up\nReverse the crowd round up\nAnd this one, new on the block just like a rookie\nFrontin like he hard dunn he mustve ate some thug cookies\nNo evidence plus I heard his clique be on that tellin shit\nYou let him sell a bit so bustin hims irrelevant\nJust get these presidents, the reallest thing man lust\nOnce the papers in my hand its like I got a roush\nAint gainin trust, cause man I aint tryina get bust\nRun for cover, pull a trigger, watch em all turn to dust\nA ribbon in the sky, I watched his mom dukes cry\nToo bad her son had to die for startin up the two four five\nGuns never lie, chains like slaves go but heavy\nDown in my belly, attatched to my waist is a celly\nFor plannin funerals and gettin niggas buried\nI wanna lead this life but I can hear it callin me like R. Kelly\n\nShoeless shine like sunny days\nMy style on the loose like runaways\nIts crazed in the battle get you open like a bag of purple haze\nWhen hell get fucked up\nCant hang slow the fuck up, I represent Staten\nPush my buttons you get stuck up\nI love thick bitches so ooh keep your ass shakin\nI be money makin, In nive seven I like em taken\nFuck fakin wilden and breaken, in the club gettin my groove on\nThe gat in my Tims just incase you wanna move on\nBeen off the Bacardi to Moe\nSlayin this chick off that keeps sweatin my body so (who can love you like\nme)\n\nSagoddi, swingin tux wit wallys\nYall niggas dont wanna try me\nFor them presidents by now Ill leave you dead\nFilled up wit hot lead, hollow heads for you thug breds\nIts the righteous, life is trifeless, challenges and sacrifices (tell em son)\nRuthless cause we flip tracks, pack gats, and give slices\nA poor heistess, you think your nice now meet the nicest\nSon a actress, stick him like a cactus, bouce like a matress\nTeflon fatigues if you try to wack this\nYou aint know it was cold on these streets\nOnly time its warm dunn when I got the heat\nDrag my knicks and five eights, I need a gimick to compete\nTriggas, Im squeazin em at the crossroad Im leavin em\nThey got the guard locked I got knocked so I could be wit them\n\nAttack wit tactics, thats fantastic that for realah\nThrow me cuts to chop the beat wit your five claws\nCreate tracks that blow the hinges off the doors\nThats all I can stands and I cant stands no more\nWhirlwind mind spins off Seagrams gin\nStarted all over and dont know where to begin\nExtreme measures got my thoughts on gettin pleasure\nThese cats know that I clap holes through they leather\nStatens sick and we cant get no better\nPolice trap, we get away too clever\nLyrics jotted down on paper causes terror-\nIsm, now im gone hit em\nGive em what we been givin em, thats the rythem\nStaight up, all you crab niggas sleepin need to wake up\nIm like peroxide cause I stay bubblin in the cut\nNigga please, Im thirsty for this cheese\nI run up in your lab and make your anti freeze\nIts like that, from the Stat where I live at\nThe bees are snakes and they just feed off the fuckin rats\n\nIf im a bastard then your a bastard\nEverybodys a bastard\nGet the gats cause shit is drastic\n",
