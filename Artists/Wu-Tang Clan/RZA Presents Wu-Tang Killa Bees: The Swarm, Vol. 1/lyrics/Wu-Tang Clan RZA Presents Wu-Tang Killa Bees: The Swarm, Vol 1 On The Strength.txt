RZA Presents Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm, Vol. 1
1998)
Okay God it's like this
If we don't manifest our power to the fullest
Man, you know what I'm saying?
Nothing will become of everything that we plan
Understand and understood God
See we goin' show them the strength in what we doing
Cause this is for he babies (indeed)
That's why it's on the strength
Everything is on the strength

Simultaneous anger to this life I'm no stranger
Galaxy mission to attack in the track black
Diplomats in the world called rapture
Death was a concept I didn't want to capture
The laughter singing over? mantress d?
Street colleagues slow up,
Their man got tow up
Guts be throw up sipping on rum
We sing from the creed of a begger's last son
Cash fast fun, no life undone
Take what you need son cause you daddy made mo' than one
And it was fun 'till reality formed screaming
From a palace where the weather's warm
Yo you have to be the father and the lord of the score
Used to hover here now it's cutting your vocal cord
No mo' speaking the lies to the weak
'Cause I'm about killing these guys with my feet
Today it's a stage maybe later it's a cosmic course
The general I be rocking on the horse
On the strength of course don't let it be in vain
Cause it's time for The Beggaz to reign, remain

A vision my facility a death world trilogy (you see that shit)
Now fictional plots speak out through gunshots
Battles won and lost at the of heaven's throne
The sky rains blood drowning the earth with red mud
I be sitting on the edge of Mars counting stars
Finding me a place in space unchaseable
No mortal can't fulfill such skill they incapable
Of keeping all the planets in-line with one mind
Make the sun and moon both shine at one time
I orchestrate the guns that air for God's sake
Precipitate make rain, hail, snow and earthquake
Levitate the gravitational pull of Haleys comet
Shake the chords of earth make a euro-volacanic vomit
Ebonic with sonic waves that blaze the human flesh
It flames extra-terrestrial it's time to reap professional
Feel the untestable force burning your course
Hints of visible thoughts be the source of Begga sorcery
... Begga sorcery

ON THE STRENGTH
Time is money and gain
ON THE STRENGTH
Math is one and the same
ON THE STRENGTH
Whining is something for pain
ON THE STRENGTH
Beggaz for ever remain

Buddah Hava who lives the ways by nature
Escape on a galactic space caper
To the nexus, transportation a glass Lexus
Forever present is Wu Chi in the essence
Of life is immortal
We travel through portals that's phenomenon,
Paragon through the octagon
My Chi gong is calm, express through Alvatron
Love hell alright is the day destroys the night
Knife divides today feathers are harmonious
And universal ways to escapades
We take what we need to survive and stay alive
Draw more sometimes as we break through the other side

The Knoliton master law and order
Astrolgoic civilize the human family throughout the populous
Live forever like metabolics
Everything I speak has logic
Estimated all partsman of the chief king fistboxin'
Inscribe within the Begga doctrine
Manual infold I roll protect my physic
From elements of the globe
We communicate like space probe,
Remainder of the square frag the author
Of the final chapter seven star grandmaster
Pugilist John Trappa M.D.
Go-go thirteen professional MC
I bomb squads like Hank Sharpley
Expose a fraud like hardcopy
I know click and shoot like paparazzi
With the never conclusive euro language of usage
Street persona, my thought is blacker than the pre-madonna
Far and beyond, If lickin' who warfare like Sadam
Invade everyone like Ghangis Khan
Forever will remain
And the Beggaz will continue go on...
