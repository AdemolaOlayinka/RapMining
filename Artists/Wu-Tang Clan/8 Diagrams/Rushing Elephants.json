Yo, these niggaz is back, son\n(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga\nYeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man\nYou hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is\nIt's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what\n\n\nAiyo, we came through thumping like elephants\nThe new Range is super-charged, I remains intelligent\nBack to the formula, lord, hard grammar\nThis is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up\nExcalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes\nWe in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast\nPolo campus, sicker lances, the crisp\nHundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps\nBack to the dormatory, where niggas\nBroke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory\nTrue holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade\nSo when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad\nNow it's 28 Days Later, now Wu's up, do something, you can't\nIt's blood in my eye, I might get amped\nTo rip something down, the billboard holders is back\nSo when you see me, you gon' say he gets down\n\n\nFrom darkness to DNA, I move with my brother\nAnd we resonate, energy that shifts in colors\nBringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it\nThe meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it\nIt was not a hobby, but a childhood passion\nThat had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned\nEvery line to line, bar for bar is clockwork\nHazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt\nCheck the total amount of MC's inflicted\nWith torture, from moving with work that's restricted\nWe criticize producers til they joints are right\nThen acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light\nHitting them from well conceiled firing positions\nWith explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen\nDrastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old\nDown the dangerous slopes of an active volcano\n\n\nBlitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers\nHang with niggas, like redneck crackers\nStrangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German\nDuck low behind the car, my tech burning\nNeck burning, from eight karats of sunlight\nAbsorbed, in the grill, Big Pun like\nLord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?\nLike J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings\nThis is my man, Chef, auto, like Grand Theft Auto\nThe 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro\nPlus A, not for apple, but I pack an apple\nShorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle\nCaramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline\nPlump breasts, was filled with saline\nHer big booty cousin, nasty Nadine\nGet you on the floor, whore tried to double team\n\n\nIs he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?\nIs he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?\nI thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets\nHe ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding\nWho testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus\nCan't quote this, chat with the sword tongue\nDuck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum\nCrazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit\nCan't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room\nSpace was demanded, beat banging through the speaker\nVoice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener\nSwing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel\nUnstoppable, direction of my flow, optional\nTo the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in\n",
