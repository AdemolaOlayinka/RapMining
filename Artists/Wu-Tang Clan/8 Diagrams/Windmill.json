Yeeaaah)\nYou know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggaz, man\n(Somebody tell me what do I do...)\nNone at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man\n\n\nAiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?\nUs locking the game, word to every hand on the lockmen\nStreet gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks\nThis is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox\nStudy like lessons, niggaz in the game biting the grain\nYou knowing where it came from, stop it\nYou thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again\nWatch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic\nCan't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt\nLove ups, don't need no batteries now, what?\nThe only niggaz that'll glow'll be us\nYo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats\nThen give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties\nDirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game\nCuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu\n\n\nWhat am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah\nSomebody tell me what do I do...\n\n\nWe keep it hot, keep the heat on the block\nWe never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop\nRaining with the patchwork of puzzles\nThat was written in the year of the dragon\nMore raw than you could ever imagine\nHow much of a great blessing to a rap city\nWhere the youth is organically fed, from the Witty\nUnpredictable, Talent And Natural Game is lyrical\nAnalyze the picture, the portrait, the visual\nA Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied\nRAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried\nHe gave y'all niggaz whiplash from bling bling\nBut my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings\nMath shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it\nFor the lower level creatures that can't peep it\nI observe MC's, regardless\nFrom a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...\n\n\n\n\nLet the track wind and ya mind flow free\nRemain conscious on this ride to ya best ability\nInfinity, back to the source of which it came\nEnergy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending\nOn and on and on and, travel with me\nNot trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact\nFor those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back\nWe have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze\nThe brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts\nFat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks\nEnough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down\nUnderneath the white T lies the four pound\nThis is forty-five minutes of menacing\nDismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone\nGet ya face blown (Get ya face blown)\n\n\n\n\nObserve the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard\nTrue to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth\nSpreading the blessing across seven continents\nArm of the trench, there's no form of defense\nEntertainment, nine swords swing rapid\nCheck the techniques, first bow to The Abbott\nWitty Unpredictable, gritty individual\nValid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural\nGame, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein\nI and I ride or die under the name\nW-U, the primary, ya secondary\nDefinitely not necessary, the legendary\nYou printed the blueprints to do this shit\nMoving the youth in the bricks\nSpit poison tipped darts that rip hearts\nThrough the chest, when I manifest my sick art\n\n\nSpeaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine\nStill in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time\nIf this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime\nSo rapid with rhymes, same slacking is assonine\nRevealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu\nGorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof\nIn living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable\nMost Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to\n\n\nI'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done\nGive a seed, mad knowledge til they cracked and run\nCan't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice\nSmack niggas in they head everytime I write\nYo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping\nWhere them little black kids do they grocery shopping\nGo to school fucked up, it's Africa Island\nWe poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent\n",
