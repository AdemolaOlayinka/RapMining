    "lyrics": "Yo... this song is...\nAiyyo Dunn this song is called Sunshower\nCause we approachin the final hour\nYou know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now\nIs stay close to your families, and all your loved ones\nCause this globe is about to explode with hatred\nThey killin for pennies, knahmsayin?\nPeace to the Gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo\n\nTrouble follows behind a wicked mind, 20/20 vision\nof the prism of light but still blind\nbecause you lack the inner, every sinner\nwill end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire\nThrow on this mix just picks your third eye out\nyou cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out\nYou remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external\nAlong with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels\nReleasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly\nAnd permanently upon this journey\nThrough the journal of the book of life\nThose who took a life without justice\nwill become just ice ice ice\nIt's been taught that your worst enemy can harm you\nas much as your own wicked thoughts\nWhat devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint\nNow you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court\nIron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal\nwith rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans\nBurn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions\nI'm convinced, Allah is God always has been always will be\nYou could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be\nninety-three million miles away from the sun\nTil you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge\nKnow the ledge to where your heart is\nor fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted\nLight travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second\nthrough time and space, until it reach a target\nAnd once we're freed of darkness, and show em where the path\nYo as the Red Sea was parted, into these straight\nat the narrow gate, but why that's a road to destruction and hate\nWhat you thought life was a sport? A game?\nOne hundred years short, know the soul is immortal\nWalk through many portals, and those who go astray\nwill pay a judgment day, and these few years of wicked bullshit\nain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake\nWith dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate\nInstead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread\nof life and fed God Degree of light to my head\nIt's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake\nAnd take care of my brother, and uncover reveal the skin\nso we can see each other, cause every color\nthat makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?\nWho's the original, who's the biochemical\nWho's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital\nDigital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo\n\nTwo hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath\nWhile niggaz minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath\nthe sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em\nStagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum\nAnd shatter bone fragments\nCops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet\nThrown into a six by eight steel cabinet\nFlippin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it\nThose who haven't learnt get returned\nYou freaky ass niggaz get burned\nSome walk around like they ain't concerned\nwith the hell goin on inside the world\nWhy do grown men molest little girls?\nIs it because the girl's breast has swelled\nto the size of a woman, although she's twelve\nThe whole world is sick, sick, sick\nTrapped up in six, six, six\nI started off as a pawn in this marathon of life\nTryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon\nA vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon\ngoin in circles, like a ferris wheel\nUndernourished meals I cherish hope, drown inside the sea of life\nUse my third eye for a periscope, and take flight to the edge of night\nTo far heights so dark that even wit a bright light\nyou couldn't see a spark of light\nWhile others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty\nhangin in halls, bangin on walls\nKickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause\nBoostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue\nKept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws\nStarted out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables\nto wearin long cables that hung down to the navel\nSo pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk\nto funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts\nDust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos\nBack when Wu-Gambinos were called F.O.I. MC's\nAll and together now crew B.C.C.\nREC Posse, G.P., D.M.D.\nOl Dirty stalked East New York GZA maintained Franklin Lane\nI was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain\nOld Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis\nTook share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service\nWhile Meth Chef and Deck was off the Nu-dol\nFor white boys who took steroids\nBuildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids\nBack when our girlfriends was virgins\nCuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Mary Birchem\nA Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving\nThese young Gods was seekin\nHoes in Westinghouse and Clara Parton and Medina\nGirls who sung like Sarafina\nOn the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her\nAs if I dreamed her\nI was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes\nSo it's always hope\nSee subway train run through the city like blood through the veins\nTo the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain\nSo take heed to these words\nAnd feel the power of the Sunshower\n\nApproachin the final hour\nPower equality, Allah sees everything\nLet's come together under the wings\nAnd take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, Ryzarecta\nIn your sector\n",
