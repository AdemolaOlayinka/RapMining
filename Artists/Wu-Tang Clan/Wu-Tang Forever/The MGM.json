One dark skinned nigga fifty-six inch rope\nwrapped around twice\nSmash the Gilligan boat with ice\nThey threw sign language\nOrdered hot coffee\nwit a danish\nRelax -- whispered, \"They rap entertainers\"\nHad Lizzy on, two Japanese birds with furs look good kid\nLaid back handlin hors d'ourves\nIt's like round three\nWe too black for BET\nYou memorize the 1 to 40\nI'm at the 19th degree\nIf a civilized person doesn't perform, his duty\nWhat shall be done?\nPardon me God, that nigga gotta gun\nBulgin out his sweatpants, check out his stance\nSee the side of his grill?\nLook like my cousin Lance\nLeft hand rock a Guess watch\nYo I think I did his Clarks he wore the crush bone leather\nwith the strings dark\nNow I remember\nHe from Bear Mountain\nHe and Mitch Greene shot the fair one\nNear the water fountain\nSeventh round, Chavez bleedin from his right ear\nYo keep ya eye on that same nigga from right here\nPopcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne\nGhost had the fly Gucci mocks wit no socks on\nSeen Deion Sanders in the back with the fat fur on\nWorkin dem hoes with the fly Wu shirts on\nMixed drink session Dunn\nPour me some more\nChef leathered down blinking at Chante Moore\nTenth round Chavez tearin em down\nSweet Pea get ya shit off\nIt's like blacks against the Germans\nGettin hit off\nSmooth and them walked in\nBrownsville representin\nThey sent a bottle over, autograph blessin\nChef pull out the doodle twist the dank pink noodles\nYo I'm bout to roll one\nMatter fact twist two of those\nYo they wound up stoppin the fight\nSteels took a point away from Chavez\nRematch scheduled on October Ninth\nRematch scheduled on October Ninth\n",
