    "lyrics": "Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down\nFor all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it\n\nYo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves\nVictims of wordly ways, memories stays engraved\nAll my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers\nThe young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger\nIn this New World the Order slaughter men, women, and children\nTen feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in\nThe projects, lifeless like a vietnam vet\nConstant war, sever threats of enemy conquest\nCrooked cops comb my building complex that's in the rumble\nStreets are like a jungle, can't let my cypher crumble\nVivid thoughts, Devils resort to trick knowledge\nThey kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars\nI know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing\nSpaced out in the staircase, performing a sting\nIt's hard to keep control, I bless those who seek a scroll\nTrying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold\nNot a role model, I walk a hard road to follow\nI sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels\nThe gospel was told, some souls it swallowed whole\nMentally they fold, and they eventually sold\ntheir life and times, deadly like the virus design\nbut too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\n\n\nA voice cries from the wilderness of the North\nA representation of the families that lost one\nall victims of incarceration\nOr other divisions of the family structure\nYouths are injected with serums that leads\nto skin irritations, babies being born with\ndisfigurations, experimentations\nOn their faces there bear world relations\nof mothers that carry the pain\nof blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail\nFifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire\nIt lightly begins to rain screams of terror\nare hidden by the passing trains\nThis can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried\nAs he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane\nJust give me a name, of who has inflicted this\nbitter sickness, and left us to witness\n\n\nYeah, yo\nCurses from war, innocent blood spills for days\nSoothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise\nTree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game\nThe wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame\nCrime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison\nWhile we die hard living people whine about religion, vision\nBlow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing\nIt's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen\nZero process, progress, become the hunted\nAmerica's most wanted, good life flaunted, want it\nSome love the speed, some satisfy a need\nSome want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed\nThe strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed\nOne flew astray, and then caught my little seed\nCan it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife\nThe righteous man would be within these stripes pipes\nTake in my energy, breath and know the rest\nCause the good die young and the hard die best\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\n\n\nY'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants\nwhile your man's on tour, your spending up his advances\nYour friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick\nThe whole projects is trapped in stench\nYou either high school drop-outs, one to three cop-outs\nFifteen years old, shorty ass and top out\nNinety-nine cent beer drinking pussy stinking\nFucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking\nNew World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid\nCan a devil fool a Muslim nowadays\nInside my lab, I'm going mad\nTook two drags off the blunts, and started breaking down the flag\nThe blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods\nThe whites for the cops, and the stars come from the clubs\nor the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn\nEarly light, why is sons fighting for the stripe\n\n\nAs we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home\nMama say, take your time young man and build your own\nDon't wind up like your old dad\nStill searching for them glory days he never had\nSo many bad want to scheme for American dream, no more kings\nThe cash rule everything now, we going down\nThese babies looking up to us, it's up to us\nThe Million Man March MC's, get on the bus\nBut envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate\nThough the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate\nNo longer, brothers, we unstable\nLike Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other\n\nYou can't party your life away\nDrink your life away\nSmoke your life away\nFuck your life away\nDream your life away\nScheme your life away\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\nCause your seeds grow up the same way\n",
