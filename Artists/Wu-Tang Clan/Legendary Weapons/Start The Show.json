Clap your hands\nUhh, let's start the show\nC'mon, c'mon\nI said one, two, three, four\n\nRevolutionary gangster, the will to kill\nEverything up, my roots is steel\nDo it big time, march through the desert and shine\nLet the C's live free while we open the minds\nof every black man, white man, no color, my writing hand\nis like dynamite, I fight for land\nBlood stains yo, gettin money affect the plan\nWe travel to Beijing and end up in Japan\nHoods everywhere, bring the goods and gear\nAnd teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards\nThen stop, check my brothers and my sisters in Africa\nWe know that's theirs, yes, we been actin up\nBush fucked the world up, and left our soldiers\nout in Iraq, bless them with roses\nFoes try to approach, we roast them goats\nWe terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes\n\n\nThey tryin to take us back to Reaganomics with atomic bombs\non Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic\nBut Islam is a way of life, Islam is the way of Christ\nIslam means peace, the beast must pay a price\nfor his wickedness, politics is the trickiest\nbusiness on this planet, the bandits are the slipperiest\nsnakes who ever slithered, you ever stop to consider\nwho's pulling these strings, from Napoleon to Hitler?\nIs there an unseen hand with the unseen plan?\nThe unclean man from the unclean land\nDesire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest\nGive his life in this world that seem so lifeless\nPut a price on things, that are priceless\nConvince us that meanness is stronger than the niceness\nWho really has the power - is is theirs, is it ours?\nIs it a democracy, or the morning prowlers?\nDo we have a press or President?\nIs it a test or a testament? Pest or pestilence?\nWho got the evidence?\nWho got the common sense? Stop all the negligence\n\n\nI oversee the world\nYou taught me that, basically\nI'm moldin rap to be more than I can see\nChef, Senator of Thoughts\nDemocratic cats\nSaved by the judge\nThe flavor, that was brought about that day\nSteaks come out, raw\n\n\n\"WU, TANG!\"\n",
