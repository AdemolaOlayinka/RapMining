    "lyrics": "At 3:47, more than 150 rounds of ammunition were fired into your apartment\nWhich was about 200 yards away\nA few moments later, another fifty to seventy five rounds were fired in the street\nAnd you're gonna stand here and tell me you didn't see a god damn thing?\n\nI live life lavish, and my chain is carats\nThe last flame on the train to Paris\nUsed to be lame, then I changed to maverick\nSo many clothes, can't name the fabrics\nDynamics, I want the fame\nAnd my name engraved in granites\nThis the lane, and I came to grab it\nYeah, you moving sideways, change your habits\nYeah, used to rock minks, then I change to rabbit\nFrom out the garbage, I came from Abbott's\nUsed to be righteous, then changed to savage\nBang my ratchet like Bangkok Dangerous\n36 Chamber Fists, trianglist\nWatch me mangle this, star spangle this\nRock cowboy wrangle it, create mega hits\nI'm from the grain, game at my finger tips\n\nYeah, Killah Hill lay it down\nKilla Beez on the swarm\nNigga...\n\nAiyo, I plow down tracks like I'm out for revenge\nFuck it, it seems like the drama never ends\nBe in the projects, like I never left out\nMight be on odds goods, see a nigga stressed out\nI can't take it, seems like my hood is cursed\nBad niggas, I thought that the good was first\nMy old hawk she march with a foul parade\nDon't learn shit, til another child is sprayed\nI'm out here, fuck it, like I live on Targhee\nAnd Rico, keep a low cut like laundry\nI don't give a fuck, ya'll made me bitter\nI'mma whip your kids out like a babysitter\nI'm a grown man, but I'm young in the mindstate\nLive in every borough but New York my tri state\nTest me, you nothing but a bitch on the tour bus\nPour piss on you, leave you stuck with four months\nMy head fucked up, I'm off my clean streak\nDon't make me pick the nines up, I come from mean streets\nMy unit snitched on me, ratted me out\nThey all ganged up on me, try to take my mouth\nHowever the cause, I'mma chill and get bent\nThat cut from dirty cloth who cut from cement\nOriginal Tazeen got the crazy glow\nThem devils try to jump me, I'm crazy though\nAbsolut Vodka rap, crushing that goose\nO.G. all day, like I be on the deuce\nPop off with it, get your army in order\nStaten Africa, Islam, across that water\n\nYeah, what you talking about, nigga?\nWord up, you think it can't happen?\nNigga, I smack all ya'll niggas\nThis Big Don from the group-iz\nNigga I be where the stoupe is\n\nYeah, told 'em, have gun will travel\nBlowing herb metals, black son still gravel\nBronzeman, oblong javelins in my cabinet\nDetroit submit seeds, salutation from the missile plant\nQuick to the hollow point, it ain't no olive branch\nMy low cal, four oh cal in the cardigan\nTempted by Satan, put a bullet in his diaphram\nWalk around black clouds and quiet violins\nItalian fire blends, poet and violent pens\nIllest ill, scotch deal, plots and iron winds\nUp hill near the ghetto spill, the sirens sing\nStreet dreams, black seed and the inspired kings\nFrom fire water veins, still rain mystery\nAnd chains due to my roots, no doubt in the ring\nOn the road to riches and diamond speech\nI might turn a bag and wash sand in the mountain peaks\n\nYo, I don't text to send messages\nMy testosterone stimulate her estrogen\nWhether black, caucasian or the Mexican\nAsians, she get the message and she coming back for sex again\nOrganic drugs, my natural persuation\nYou under the influence of 36 invasion\nSpider-Man amazing, but I'm darker than Parker\nSkin got abrasions from Maria and Tasha\nSliding down a street pole, pull up to your party\nStimulated with a jeep full of cherry gap honeys and bottles of Vodka\nPlus the weed bowls, here we go\nMeditating, never jealous, over zealous\nWu-Tang Clan's my fellowship, fans massive acapellas\nOf our lyrics, would be with tracks embelishes\nThe idea clearer that Wu-Tang Forever\nThis, way of life is art, rhymes and cleverness\nEnjoying by God, no man could sever this\nI complete jobs, free and effortless\nUse Tiger Crane, Snake Style plus the Leopard Fist\n",
