    "lyrics": "I warn you shitface! I pick who I'm gonna bury next\nSay your prayers fast, cause you're about to feel my arm in\n\nFreedom of speech; watch how I reach my potential\nI stay on the hunt for dope tracks and instrumentals\nTravel the world, found black diamonds in the Everglades\nFought temptations, slapboxed in the devil's cage\nThe globetrotter, spot rusher\nI bust in your mouth like a gusher, it's Wu-Tang motherfucker!\n\"Iron Man,\" I cock my music in the chamber\nI'm God's gift; heard I was born in a manger\nDanger! Cosmetic face rearrange you\nLeave you slumped on the chessboard, found by a park ranger\nBurst of adrenaline, bungee jumped off the Verrazano\nI sky dive in some sky blue Ferragamo's\nRan the streets heavy, kept my charms chunky\nYou damn right I fuck fans and I keep the munchies\n\nGuess you must be, the four dog fist champion\n(I've heard of this devil's kick, of course yeah)\n(Everyone knows in the kung-fu world)\n(It's a method that's never been defeated yet)\nHahaha, and won't be\nI suppose I should warn you\nI've been given good money, to kill you\n\nYo, loose cannon, forty-deuce flicks, two parrots\nLay back at The Palace like Mike Harris\nCallous, fly nicest, metallic bang mallets\nFly your whole carriage to Paris\nThe black Pat Garrett, karats on Donna Karans\nGuys die tryin to drive the McLaren\nIslamic, burn chronic out on the terrace\nAngelic, your body lie cold without spirit\nMy finest hour, you're sacrificed to a higher power\nFly from the tower, I fry sour\nAnd buy powder, 40 Cal give your pal a shower\nYou shit in your Calvin Klein trousers\nThe night prowler, your life is ours\nKnife your Eddie Bauer, leave you pushin up flowers\nYou ain't counter chip counters\nThem niggaz is pimps, your bitch shouted\nThe 650 get clouded\n\nYou'll see! I'm a master now\nAnd whoever insulted you, pays with his life for this\nThat I swear! I'll fight now\n(Okay, not bad)\n(Patience, you've not seen it all yet)\n\nYo, gun or beef, I don't discriminate, beat dudes black and blue\nSnack on crews like they food, takin space up on my dinner plate\nDependin on my mental state, the mood that I'm in'll make\nme charge like a bull, pull the tool out and ventilate you\nSin-ner takes you down, lace your crown, face get found\nfull of rounds from the pound, that detonate when they penetrate\nCan tell you always been a snake, you don't move like I do\nImitators hate the fact that they can't do what I do\nI'm mindful of my rivals, I can smell 'em when they slide through\nProvide you my arrival, still won't even get a side view\nWon't know that life is over, 'til I'm standin right beside you\nIt's not that I don't like you motherfuckers, I despise you\nThe other different pedigree, not cut from the same cloth\nStay G'd up from the feet up, while your heart pump duck sauce\nI love it when they tough talk, my guns lust to bust off\nBut every time I squeeze they call police to bus me up North\nSin-ister the Finisher, they label me a menace and got\nmad when I laughed at the judge durin sentencing\nNot, glorifyin prison but I'm built tough for biddin\nSee survival of the fittest shit I live it e'ry minute\nEvery hour to the second, I'm granted my respect\nNever catch the God in the yard, sharpenin the weapons\nGot, shooters on demand, new recruits to the Clan\nSticking everything movin, more loot for the fam\nAin't a damn thing changed, just say the name bitch\nWu-Tang!\n",
