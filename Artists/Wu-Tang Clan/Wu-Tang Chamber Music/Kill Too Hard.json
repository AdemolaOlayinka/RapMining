These dudes don't want it with Deck, no, my set glow\nHate it or you love it, but you gonna respect though\nYou ain't got to know my name, check the blood, sweat & tears\nFor years, niggas know I bang\nI'm a made nigga, caking what you call a boss\nOn my own two, never taking orders from ya'll\nWhat I spit, get the corners involved, it's wreck on the yard\nIt's House Gang, son, it's more than hard\nThe life that'll glamour and glitz, best believe\nOn the flip side, nigga, it's them hammers and clips\nWanna live in high fashion and rich, so we scramble the strip\nCamouflage, with they hand on the grip\nAin't nothing gon' stop kid from getting his due\nNo, your feets not big enough to fit in his shoe\nI don't rock what you rap, niggas, they be pole\nOn 'the wire', just not HBO\nThey under fire, edge around the way we know\nThey know they time up, guess that's why they hate me so\nBut yo, they will never take me though, I had to go like\nMontana, licking, sniffing crazy blow\nStill I be Hard to Kill like Seagal\nWarrior built, big shield and long sword\nOne Six Ooh'ing it, doing it, king size\nSalutations, that's respecting the king eyes\nFor those that follow my lead, attract to the light\nAt the same time, marvel the speed\nI'm so dope, I can bottle it free\nThe most influential, modern day murderous he\n\n\nYo, deep in the bungalo, chopping the motherload\nCarving my own path, taking another road\nI need a son to soul, he brought the troops with him\nIt sounds presidential, I got the truth serum\nDon't want the booth near him, respect in the sabotage\nI'm on the patio, stretched in my camouflage\nAnd my grammar's hard, the Wolverine skeleton\nI be the yellow man, snatching on the other brand\nBut on the other hand, light up the darkness\nI'm stir fried, nigga, yeah, I'm heartless\nMy apartment is a hole in the wall, nigga\nPass me the rock, stop holding the ball\nI told you before, under worser conditions\nChessboxing, nigga, mic's a dead body position\n\n\nAiyo, it's time to make cash dinero\nI'm going to the Summer Jam concert to bash your hero\nLie up in your bedroom, smash your bureu\nWe looking for the money, man, pass the Euro\nApartment to pesos, pass the yen\nAnd, we don't want to have to ask again\nCuz we ain't gon' be laughing then\nThese three men, take on your whole staff and win\nLook, labels stay messing with a cat's future\nAnd that weighs on me heavy like Rasputia\nBut I still keep spitting like a shortshop\nI'mma be sitting at the table when the cork pop\nYou gon' be sitting at the table with a porkchop\nLacking on the beat like a short cop\nIt's your boy Ace, BK's own\nAll you ringtone rap dudes, please stay home, come on\n",
