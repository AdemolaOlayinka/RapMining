Answer me, let me if it's the truth now\nThat pretty mole above your lips looking cute now\nOoh child, I'm patient, my mind's telling me\nTo stay calm, I wanna get it off like a G bomb\nOn top of your skin, I'm sliding it in\nWhen I'm done, you can wake it up and ride it again\nThen we can hold on through the night, fan on and covers on\nIt's bright from the TV light, peace, good night\n\n\nLooking out my window, sun shining bright\nBirds are singing, trying to make things right\nNow I got music, oh, on my radio\nAnd I can hear love songs playing, behind closed doors\nNow I don't want no one, on the catch me side\nBut ever since you left, said goodbye\n\n\nI wish you were here with me\nI said I wish you were here with me\nI wish you were here, with me\n\n\nAnd thinking bout your kiss, gloom all around me\nSeen our love, is never gonna find me\nAnd I keep looking, oh, for that brighter day\nWhen all I see is, time slipping away\nOh and I got to talk, to keep myself together\nBut all I see is stormy weather\n\n\n\n\nNow I got to get, get myself together\nCuz I can't take no more, of this stormy weather\nNow I wish you were here with me\nI wish you were right here\nI wish you were here with me, ooh\n\n\n\n\nNight falls and I call for you, love\nBut there's no one here to answer\nNo, no, no, oh\nThe wind blows and I turn to catch ya\nBut there's no one there but my reflection\nNo, oh I said I wish you was here with me\n",
