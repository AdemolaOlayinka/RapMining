    "lyrics": "\"Give it up! But - it's - just - no - use!\"\n\n\"Give it up! Oh Lord.... give it all to you\nI try, but - it's - just - no - use!\"\n\nAiyo, give it up, rush you up, no fuss, blood rush\nCuss much, what's mine? You bust nuts, crunch crunch\nSpark the bud, what's what, the white King Tut\nOut in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the Rugged\nOn the record with J-Live, I could hardly believe this\nI never thought I'd be rapping on no record with school teachers\nHair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury\nTV, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, hostility\nHumility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy\nStill is he, actually, really killed me, billy\nAll that stuff you heard about me, is probably true\nHeard I got the AIDS virus, I probably do\nAmmunition spitting is him, is it, you listening\nLittering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him\nSticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him\nDid he did it, or did he didn't, admit it\nPretend he ain't offended, the men and women\nEvery minute they in it, don't be\nEvery illiterate ignorant critical dissed it\nEvery idiot that ain't live it, they talking shit\nI'm R.A. the Rugged Man, get off, my dick\n\n\nGive it up, for the Gods & the Earths, ladies and gentleman\nAll the human families, the wicked can't stand me\nThe righteous man hands me the mic, it's uncanny how\nOne man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore\nThe label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport\nStill can't stop a grown man, from pressing report\nA free man can either be freedom or free label\nWhen you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save\nA damn thing, no savings, that's how life'll enslave ya\nThat's why I strive daily; to be my own savior\nI know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior\nSo caught in between checks, I spilled it in respect\nSo give it up, if your mission's belittling my position\nAs a microphone physician, making you listen\nMe and Rugged Man relate, through a previous poem\nLike he said, I'm mad famous, for being unknown\nOn records for ten years, I can hardly believe it\nNever thought I'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher\nJust some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time\nJust some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme\nJust another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist\nStop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks\nThis will stomp you on your track, justice is not just\nAnother ordinary rapper, I'm the crown royal block\nWith a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back\nAnd backed by, a whole nation of millions\nYou can't hold me, my new floor is my old ceiling\nThat's why I'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just\n",
