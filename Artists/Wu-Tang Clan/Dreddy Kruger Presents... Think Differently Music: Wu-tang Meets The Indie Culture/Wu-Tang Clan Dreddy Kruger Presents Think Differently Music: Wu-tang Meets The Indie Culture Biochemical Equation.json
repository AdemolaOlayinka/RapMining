    "lyrics": "Tempted by the sins of life, the pleasures of lust\nWith wild imaginings that you can't discuss\nOh, the flesh is weak, it's a struggle for feast\nIt's a daily conflict between man and beast\nWe, strive for God, and a better tomorrow\nStill suffering, from the unforgettable sorrow\nRepent from thy sins, son, and walk these straight\nStop talking all that trash, boy, and spark these straight\nEvicted by the pressures of life, at every vital point\nStill, I wouldn't give an oint'\nOr, flinch an inch, or pitch a pinch\nOff the pie, or every try to try your winch\nConfronted by the devil himself, and stay strong\nYou think you can take the King, now meet Kong\nStrong as the base of a mountain, there's no counting\nHow many MC's, have sprung from our fountain\nFifty thousand year process, to make this combination\nI'm not, giving mine away to Satan\nAlthough, I know that he's awaiting\nTo get ahold of my biochemical equation\nI'mma slip him son, I'mma dip him, son\nWhen I catch the drop on him, I'mma clip him, son\nFifty thousand year process, to make this combination\nNinety nine elements, biochemical manifestation\nI'm not giving mines away to Satan\nAlthough, I know that he's awaiting\nI'mma slip him son, I'mma dip him, son\nWhen I catch the drop on him, I'mma clip him, son\n\nBet oc', straight to the head with the pet rock\nAt least til I can get from out this booth, it's like a sweat box\nTrained a few bars of head nodding, throw us a stack\nPants militant sawed up like linen, bobbing bonus pack\nInvest in the first b-boy kid show, life on skid row, with jive talking negro's\nHe wear his beard like a frizzly haired grizzly\nAnd kept his appearances exquisitely rare, where is he?\nIs he in the backyard, or on your front porch\nOr standing in the corner of the club, with the blunt torched\nYou're soft, they say he rhyme like he starving\nAnd sold odds and bob kins, to old gods and goblins\nValley, adjust a pest and your worst best friend\nWho mending with space time fabric like polyester blend\nNot a hobby for no body, lead less from men\nOr sloppy like the rest of them, they probably need estrogen\n\nYo, yo, drunk or sober, son, don't lose your composure\nSemi off the Remy, mixed with Henny, Moet demi'\nUnderneath the passenger seat, son, tuck the semi'\nIsraeli issued, automatic black pistol\nThe cop with the flashlight, chew gum as he whistle\nTapped on the glass, roll it down fast\nLicense, registration, addressed to your lab\nThey made insurance, the reason why I pulled you over\nCuz the way you were swerving, sir, you can't be sober\nHave you been drinking? Breathe into the breathalyzer\nGet out the car, please, follow this exerciser\nPut one finger on your nose, now from heel to toe\nWalk in a straight line, ten paces, down the road\nMy homeboy Kano, used to do the mashed potato\nOn cartwheels, and then spin house like whirled tornado\nThat used to chase the light, but, son, he will always save ya\nBecoming pump blows, and make beats inside my basement\nDrunk or sober, never lose your composure\nStress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers\nIf you can't understand, then come closer\nWe civilize the uncivilized cuz we supposed to\nDrunk or sober, never lose your composure\nMight give your hand, black man stand as a soldier\nStress on the brain, cause pain and stomach ulcers\nIf you can't understand, then come closer...\n",
