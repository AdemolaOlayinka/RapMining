    "lyrics": "Yo, rated x, smack you off the stage when I'm vexed\nNo sweat, I crack a cold case of Beck's\nGuess whose back, the jack of all trades is next\nThe rap cuisine, I crack a raw egg and flex\nI cave in your chest, this one came from the jets\nYeah, the cause and effect, make innocent blood pour\nThe streets is like the rap game, a daily tug of war\nFor rich or for poor, or death do us part, niggaz come for test\n\nStill grimey (grimey, grimey)\nStill slimey (slimey, slimey)\nDon't try me (try me, try me)\nIt's been ten long years, you can't untie me\n\nBring fire and Ruck let the heat pour\nNiggaz like Ruck 'Fuck you rhyming to this beat for?'\nListen, life is like a muthafuckin' seesaw\nOne minute you're hot, the next, your rep drops\nNone of your biz, fuck around, and run in your crib\nWife like 'He ain't here', throw some to your wiz\nNiggaz running up on me, til the tre' pound click\nTalking 'bout 'Ruck, let's battle' on some 8 Mile shit\nI'm like; nigga, my name ain't B. Rabbit\nIt's Sean Price, Big Ruckus from busting these ratchets\nCall me gay basher, for fucking up these faggots\nYa'll niggaz ain't nothing, stop fronting, stay passive\nYo, pass the dutch, on the left hand side\nSean gone til November, stole Wyclef's ride\nBob Backlund, car jacking, New Jersey driving\nYa'll niggaz ain't think about rapping, til you hear me rhyming, oh\n\n\nI keeps it real in the field, Navy feel on the drill\nNever stingy with my bills, plenty gravy I spilled\nRecorded in the history of rap, two inch reels\nSeven to ten mills, eleven to twenty hills\nRest in peace to my brother Half-A-Mil\nUnnecessary blood spilt, another thug killed\nMove with the mass appeal, the blast still\nFor the Cash Money Click, No Limits and no thrills\nMad cuz your hoe, feeling P. Sunzini, give you\nAs sweet as a kiwi, face it, you not me, nigga\nLadi dadi, the Gods like to party\nWe don't cause trouble, but we can make you a body\nLadi dadi, the Sunn likes to party\nI don't cause trouble, but I will make you a body\nFlowin' high in the Mazarati, two with my ninjas beside me\nLively, floating on some Ducatti's\nWith two gellati's, two hotties, we never sloppy\nJewelry rocky, Spanish pieces, they call me papi\nClear fire Bacardi, sobered up like Gotti\nRest in peace to my dog, Shotti, Shotti\n\n\nOn the corner ready to bo', holding my nuts\nStanding by my building looking at myself in the truck\nMy reflections... (still grimey)\nOscar the Grouch's worms (still slimey)\nI got a jones for Miss Piggy's ham hiney\nI can be a bum in the slums, and slam shiny\nOn every corner, I'm grams, you can find me\nThe boss of the burners, I fire shots if your nine speak\nThis is true Manchu, and who you, fams too?\nBetter have they face in the game, like the Blue Man Group\nI heard you smell me, I make it funky\nRock hard and kick ass like, I hate you donkeys\nMy oatmeal lumpy like Johnson's Bumpy, Harlem humpty\nHungry wolves, pain's hummer, harbor hungry\nDumpty, blazing trees, now leave an O.E. present\nKnow why the hood feel me, like police presence\n",
