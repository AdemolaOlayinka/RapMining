You know we in trouble

Kit kat, kick back homie don't you sit back
And hype when the sound start
To click like a click-clack
Only nigga trippin lil' homie where ya shit at
You rep don't got no respectance

So lift that point that aim where's his dome at
Show these punk niggas how we do where we roam at
Roll that, roll that TVs on the
Roll back caddies start to cap
Twenty niggas in the throwback

Don't pretend that, you ain't got no chance
Put these balls where ya chin at
Spit heat, get cheese

Who that move that nigga where ya crew at
You betta get ya money nigga

I hope ya mouth ain't runny nigga
If it is, ya body gon' hop like bunny nigga

We got the gangsta way gangsta say
We got the gangsta walk
Gangsta talk, gangsta way
