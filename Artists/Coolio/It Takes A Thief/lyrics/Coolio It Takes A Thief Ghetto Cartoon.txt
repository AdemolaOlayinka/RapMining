Coolio
It Takes A Thief
1994)
Once upon a time in a land called fuck
Lived a duck named Donald and his mother was a cluck
Mickey Mouse wore a rag, pants in a sag
Neighborhood kingpin, but his brother was a fag
Donald had beef, so Mickey couldn't sleep
They was hootin for a while, and it was gettin kinda deep
Bugs Bunny had the props on the Eastside spots
Known to hit a five from a mile with a shot
Goofy was Mickey Mouse righthand man
One day smoked a stick, and came up with a brand
Called Pixie and Dixie, two killers from Chicago
A game of 5K, to eliminate Donald
But what they didn't know, is Donald was a G
Had big time respect, from the West to the East
Haps up see, and listen to the funk
First chapter in the funky cartoon from the ghetto

Huey and Duey and Louie with a
Shot down Mickey Mouse main ho Minnie
Everybody know Minnie got shot down
And the cop on the case was Huckleberry Hound
Huckleberry had a Deputy, by the name of Dog
Eye-witness to the crime was Kermit the Frog
But Kermit was scared and he wouldn't testify
Pixie and Dixie just did a driveby
On Donald Duck, but they shot and they missed
And now Bugs Bunny is gettin kind of pissed
Cause the shot that they missed hit his homeboy Elmer
Bugs sellin drugs on the motherfuckin corner
The future's lookin shitty in fuck city
So they called in the Feds, Beetlejuice and Miss Piggy
Shit's on the street, no that's how it goes
Scene two in the funky cartoon from the ghetto

Now the war is on and Mickey Mouse is dead
Quick Draw McGraw took two to the head
Huey and Duey and Louie got caught
And now they in the county, ready to sell out
Pixie and Dixie's on the run from the mob
Cause they tried to kill Donald and they didn't do the job
Bugs Bunny got popped, in a bar gettin drunk
Bullet fucked up Beetlejuice, while Miss Piggy had a pump
Donald got the word that his nephews was snitchin
So Tom and Jerry stuck em on they way to the kitchen
Goofy was a punk and everybody knew
Him and Huckleberry Hound was spotted drinkin brew
In the alley out back, in the corner in the dark
But they both got smoked by Jabberjaw the Shark
Donald Duck got the whole damn city sewed up
In a ghetto cartoon in a land called fuck
