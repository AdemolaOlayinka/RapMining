Now I know, the story is told\nAnd I don't even call 'em back cuz they don't know the homie cold\nI recieved a page my niggers from the phone in the back\nI got a wink from a fine ass sista dressed in black\nAnother double shout of yak and now the room is spinnin'\nBut that's only the beginning, god damn!\n\n\n\n\nI take a walk out to the front to get myself some air and\nsee if I see the homies, but they still ain't there\nThere's a fool outside drunk and he want to get into it\nI was strapped I coulda killed him, but I didn't do it\nI opted for the walk-away, watch the busta talk away\nSo mister policeman, you can put your chalk away\nI mobb back in the club, and, kick it at my table\nCause, niggaz be acting stupid, and stupid shit is fatal\nThe homies is hella late, and now I'm startin' to think\nHomegirl that gave me the wink from earlier just bought me a drink\nShe's sittin' at a stool at the other side of the bar\nDoing tricks with her tounge and a cherry like a porno star\nThe club is gettin' packed and the party is jumpin\nAnother double shot of yak and I'm on the dancefloor bumpin'\nShe's licking in my ear and, now I'm feeling faded\nIt's 11:35 and the homies still ain't made it\n\n\n\n\nNow I'm on the dance floor with baby and, shit is gettin' hectic\nThe big homey done erected, damn I've been affected\nBy the funk in the boom and the booty in the room\nThis ain't the Commodores but this Brick House got me on zoom\nNow I'm mackin and struttin and asking baby wassup\nMy name ain't Everlast, but I can still make you jump\nlet's, hope in the Q and go somewhere and kick it like some Trojans\nWe can do a little drinkin, and do a little smoking\nWhen all of a sudden I start sweatin', my stomach starts bubblin'\nI hear earl coming, I think I'm in trouble *vomit sounds*\nAhh shit, I got baby on her titties\nI guess there go my chances of gettin with her kitty\nI turn around and stumble away and there go the homies with\nlong ass trenchcoats on, laughing, sippin on 40's\nNow I'm in the back of my own car curled up like a punk\nCuz I got too high and uhh, got too drunk\n\n\n\nBig throw up S-P-L-A-S-H\nSHIT!\n",
