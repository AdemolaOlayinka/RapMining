Hey teacher!

-Peace!
-There is no peace!
-Why?
-Who wants to know?
-We do!
-Cause men love money!
-Why?
-Greed!
-Why not share?
-I know
-Why?
-Why not?
-Cause to share shows that you care for ev'rybody!
It's a shame that all people won't stick together
Don't they know that deep inside we need each other?
There are places in our world, where kids are starving
Don't you know they should not starve, cause they're the future!
-Hey, preacher!

It's a shame that men at war won't stop the fighting
Don't you know they should not fight, cause they are dying!
There are places in our world, where bombs are dropping
Even though they know it's wrong, they'll never stop it!
It's a shame. It's a shame
It's a shame. It's a shame
It's a dirty, dirty world!
