Vibe electricity\nStrong like a bomb, quick like a comet\nCan I get whatever from Mr. Muhammad?\n\n\n\n\nIf Muhammad has the breaks, who will have the backs?\nBodies set it up all flow to rhythm stack\nOkay I see my brother (huh), you know what we can do (what?)\nCruise with the rhythms (hah), Shaheed will lead us too (yeah)\nPosin with the hotties (huh), harder than the hard (hard)\nStill Muhammad plays with a full deck of cards (card)\nThe Tribe's stuff is present (yeah), established with the beat (beat)\nWe roll around on wheels (huh) or utilise the feet (feet)\nGo and keep progressin (huh), egos of the Tribe (Tribe)\nIf we have to swing it (uhh) we won't take a dive (dive)\nComprende my compadre? (Yeah) Kid you want some more? (Yeah)\nMuhammad push the button (huh), sample sing the score (ho)\n\nBrothers try to pose, up with the Tribesmen\nRhythm on your toes, yes it's the funk again\nAppreciate the flow, denounce the circuit breakers\nDo it with the best, the movers and the shakers\nBustin out your heap, ??? my vehicle\nBurnin up the felts, rhythm's up to me\nIt will be strong like a bomb, quick like a comet\nCan I get a whatever from Mr. Muhammad?\n\n\n\n\nSitting on the dock (huh), fin' to make a wish (word)\nMuhammad oh Muhammad (huh), damn you're quite a dish (dish)\nFondeling the groove (groove), with the mystic sense (sense)\nHoneys won't you try (huh), they push you in the tents (tents)\nBut I don't give a damn (word), rhythms make you swing (huh)\nIf you don't like it (no), you can pucker up (hoo)\nYou listenin Mr. Quayle (yeah), if you're hiding just give up (hoo)\nI'm a rhythm monster (wild), who's out on a prowl (yeah)\nMuhammad gives a hoot (hoot) like Woodsy the Owl (yeah)\nComprende my compadre (uh huh)? Kid you want some more (word)?\nMuhammad push the button, sample sing the score (ooh)\n",
