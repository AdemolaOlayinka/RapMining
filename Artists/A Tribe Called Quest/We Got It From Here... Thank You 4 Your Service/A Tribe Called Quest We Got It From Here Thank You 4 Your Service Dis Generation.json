    "lyrics": "Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat\nStatus, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league\nGrabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed\n'Cause I believe\nThe potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed\nIf rationale is naturale or a weave\nIt's all edges and peas\nSettin' press, we on a permanent steeze\nI'm in a world where my princess is Leia\nAnd she's feeling my Vader\nAnd my lure grows greater and greater\nChem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors\nHave you shaking like Gator\nBeen trill, nigga, process the data\nBlu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later\nKappo Masa with a G to my waiter\nYou can't define us, XY us, or Z us\nYou generational elitists\nHave your chi in virtual think pieces\nSee, these written words are poetical science\nBrain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby\nThey're a major appliance\nLeave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant\nDude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers\nCool with some buyers\nYeah, nigga, cool with some growers\nNever no tattletales, only I don't knowers\nWe a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us\nSo listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing\nMouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise\nDudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys\nVersed in, rehearsed in the soothing of loins\nTalk to Joey, Earl, Kendrick, and Cole, gatekeepers of flow\nThey are extensions of instinctual soul\nIt's the highest in commodity grade\nAnd you could get it today\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nRules di nation\nOne hitting reading pages of Poe\nTelly is low, cuddle bunny ready to go\nDay of the dead\nBury all the zombies instead\nAnd it's just your aftermath, Busta cuttin' your dreads\nBruce Leein' niggas, while you niggas UFC\nSmoke tree on niggas, sizzle out your USB\nSurge pricing on these Ubers, I'mma get me a cab\nYo, where Jarobi at? Imbibing on impeccable grass\nI be in NYC waiting for that law to pass\nPass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last\nRichard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass\nMagic Mike on the mic, David Blain, Douglass Henning\nIn the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting\nHorizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens\nDon't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgiven\nLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen\nB-b-b-b-b-b-but wait\nJust spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet\nThis mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife\nStudent of the past trailblazing a daze\nNot acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase\nWe still the highest of commodity grade\nAnd you could get it, get it, get it, get it today\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nRules di nation\nThis is our generation, generation, uh huh, yeah\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh\n",
