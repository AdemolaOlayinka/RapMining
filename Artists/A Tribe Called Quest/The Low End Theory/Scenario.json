(who's that??) Browwwwwwwwn\nSome may, I say, call me Charlie\nThe word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley\nLayback on the payback, CONTACT!\nCan I get a hit? (HIT!)\nBoom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip\nEast coast stompin, rippin and rompin\nNew York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton\nChecka-checka-check it out!\nThe loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce\nAnd wow how now wow how now Brown cow\nWe're ill till the skill gets down\nFor the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new\nbut the rest are doo-doo\nFrom radio, to the video, to Arsenio\nTell me! Yo, what's the scenario\n\n\n\n(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo\nScenario's ready yo, rates more than four\nScores for the snores that's lovin dancefloors\nNow I go for mine,\nShip-shape plus Grape Apes to play tapes\nPapes make grapes great for the waist\nI'm an L-AH, an E-ADER, simply just a leader\nBass in his face means peace see ya later\nLater? (LATER!) Later alligator\nPop blows the weasel and my Earth the inflater\nSo yo the D what the O, incorporated I-N-C into a flow\nFunk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight\nLaugh yo how's that sound (ohhhhhh!)\n\n\n\nIt's the leader Quest vision and we got the goods here (here!)\nNever on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear!)\nI could give a damn about a ill subliminal\nStay away from crime cause I ain't no CRIMINAL\nI love my young nation, groovy sensation\nNo time for hibernation, only elation\nDon't ever try to test, yo whattup little kid?\nYo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did\n\nI heard you rushed and rushed, AND ATTACKED\nThen baby puked then you had TO SMACK\nCausin rambunction, throughout the sphere\nRaise the levels of the boom, inside the ear\n\nYou know I did it\nSo don't violate or you get violated\nThe hip-hop sound is well agitated\nWon't ever waste no time on the played out ego\nSo here's Busta Rhymes with the, Scenario\n\n\n\nWatch, as I combine all the juice from the mind\nHeel up, reel up, bring it back, come rewind\nPowerful impact BOOM! from the cannon\nNot braggin, try to read my mind just imagine\nVo-cab-u-lary's necessary\nWhen diggin into my library\nOh my gosh! Oh my gosh!\nEating ayea toadstool like the one Peter Tosh-a\nUh, uh uhh, alone with the track man\nUh, pardon me, uhh, as I come back\nAs I did it yo I heard you beg your pardon\nWhen I travel to the Sun I roll with the squadron\nRRRRRROAW RRRRRRROAW like a dungeon dragon\nChange your little drawers cause your pants are saggin\nTry to step to this, I will, fits you in a turban\nAnd had you smellin right, like some old stale urine\nCheckady-choco, the chocolate chicken\nThe rear cock diesel, for chicks they were kickin\nYo, bustin out before the Busta bust a nut the rhyme\nthe rhythm is in sync (UHH!) the rhymes are on time (TIME!)\nRippin up this dance just like a radio\nObserve the vibe and check out the scenario!!\nYeah, my man motherfucker!\n",
