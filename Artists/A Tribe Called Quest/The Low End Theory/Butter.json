    "lyrics": "1988 Senior Year, Garvey High\nWhere all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly\nLoungin with the Tipster, Coolin with Sha\nScopin out the honeys - they know who they are\nI was the b-ball playin fly rhyme sayin\nFly girl gettin but never was I sweatin\nCause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll\nUntil I met my match - her name was Flo\nYeah - I messed around with the one called Flo\nAll the troopers round the way used to call her a ho\nBut deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go\nCause I thought it was me - like Bell Biv Devoe\nBut little did I know that she was playin' with my mind\nThe only thing I learned is, good girls are hard to find\nI feel like Heavy D I need somebody for me\nNot someone who's mind is blank and tryin' to juice me for my bank\nSwingin' with my main man Lucky behind my back\nWhat type of crap is that - yo, hows about a smack?\nWord life, I can't front - thought I was all that\nBut now it seems, I met my match\nWas a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack\nSettlin' down with one girl, wasn't tryin' to hear that\nI had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen\nTina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy\nUsed ta love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em\nFind 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em\nMy whole attitude was new day, next hon\nAnd believe it or not, they all got done\nWell here comes Flo, with the crazy whip appeal\nAnd I'm all true man, like Alexander O'Neal\nIs this really love, then again, how would I know\nAfter all this time tryin' to be a superhoe\nShe finally played me, but yo, I'd find another\nCause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter\n\n\n\nButter, like butter baby . . .\nNot no Parkay, not no margarine,\nStrickly butter baby, strictly butter\n\n\n\nI remember when,\nGirls were goodie two shoes, but now they turned to freaks\nAllofasudden \"We love you Phife\" - ease of ho, my name's Malik\nPhife this, Phife that, where you goin', where you at\nThese girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack\nYou didn't want me then, so hon, don't want me now\nHere, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow\nAnd take the Ccontact out your eye, you're far from lookin' fly\nYou get an E for effort, and T for nice try\nNow tell me what's the reason, for dyin' your hair\nSlum village gold still danglin in your ear\nYou barely have a neck but still sportin' a rope\nFour-finger ring just so Phifer can scope\nYou looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do\nYesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue\nYour whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true\nAnd if you really loved yourself then you would try and be you\nIf your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya\nBut since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya\nIf you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it\nIf you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it\nIf you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it\nI asked who did your hair and you tell me \"Diane made it\"\nIf you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe\nBut I can't stand, no bionic lady\nTryin' hard to look fly, but yo, you're lookin' dumber\nIf I wanted someone like you I woulda swung with Jamie Summers\nYou wanna be treated right, see Father MC\nOr check Ralph Tresvant, for sens-a-tiv-i-ty\nSee I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers\nPhife Dog is on the mic and I'm smooth like Butter . . .\n",
