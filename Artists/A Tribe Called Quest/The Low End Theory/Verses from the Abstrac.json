The evil money taker?\nThe crazy move faker, I used that to break her\n\n\nPhife is in the house, Uncle Mike is in the house\nBob Power is in the house, Tim Latham is in the house\nWise Men is in the house, Brand Nubs is in the house\nThe J Beez, they in the house and De La, they in the house\n\nI must regroup my thoughts and kick the next ones for my people\nPlease don't be deceived by ugly slice of evil\nThe world is kinda cold and the rhythm is my blanket\nWrap yourself up in it, if you love it, then you'll thank it\nDon't move to rebuttal, wave your hand for action\nThe ladies of the '90's want more than satisfaction\nThey want keys and Gs, and all those illy things\nIf you want to, I'll show you, just what the Ab can bring\nI keep a tight net with my brothas Ken and Kenny\nIf the question is of rhymes, then I'll tell ya, I got plenty\nThe thing that men and women need to do is stick together\nProgressions can't be made if we're separate forever\nI hooked this funky beat with the loop and the feature\nWith the funky singin by Miss Vinia Mojica\nSo listen because the Quest is led through the underground\nMy people been up on Quest to long, no more will we be down\nPeople tend to riff cuz they don't know the mental\nPeople tend to bug cuz their beats are hard but gentle\nAfro kinda lurks through the body of this youngun'\nPlay like Bobby Byrd on your back and your comin to\nThe house of the jazz, of the funk, of the rhythm\nAll the goods are welcome, but if you're a villain\nI'll just wait and debate, contemplate your arrival\nIf flexin is your motive, then you don't like survival\nThe Abstract is speakin, the hard beats is reachin\nThe Black and Puerto Ricans\nCuz their butt naked, streakin through the ever murky streets\nOf the urbanized areas\nBlastin out the speakers is the hip hop hysteria\n\nCraig is in the house, Pete Rock is in the house\nCL is in the house, Ultra Mag is in the house\nNice and Smooth is in the house, Big Daddy Kane is in the house\nBeatnuts is in the house, Special Ed is in the house\n\nYeah\nThis one goes out to my man\nThanks alot Ron Carter on the bass\nYes my man Ron Carter is on the bass\nNow check it out\nBorn into the 91 decade\nYou gotta say the Quest is on\nAnd goddamn it, yes the Quest is on\nAnd we out!\n",
