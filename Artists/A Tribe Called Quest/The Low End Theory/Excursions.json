    "lyrics": "Back in the days when I was a teenager\nBefore I had status and before I had a pager\nYou could find the Abstract listening to hip hop\nMy pops used to say, it reminded him of be-bop\nI said, well daddy don't you know that things go in cycles\nThe way that Bobby Brown is just ampin like Michael\nIts all expected, things are for the lookin\nIf you got the money, Quest is for the bookin\nCome on everybody, let's get with the fly modes\nStill got room on the truck, load the back boom\nListen to the rhyme, to get a mental picture\nof this black man, through black woman victim\nWhy do I say that, cuz I gotta speak the truth man\nDoing what we feel for the music is the proof and\nPlanted on the ground, the act is so together\nBonafied strong, you need leverage to sever\nThe unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is\ndeliberatley cheered LP filled with streeet goods\nYou can find it on the rack in your record store (store)\nIf you get the record, then your thoughts are adored\nand appreciated, cause we're ever so glad we made it\nWe work hard, so we gotta thank God\nDishin out the plastic, do the dance till you spastic\nIf you dis... it gets drastic\nListen to the rhymes, cuz its time to make gravy\nIf it moves your booty, then shake, shake it baby\nAll the way to Africa a.k.a. The Motherland (uh)\nStick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand\nThat's the right hand, Black Man (man)\nOnly if you was noted as my man (man)\nIf I get the credit, then I'll think I deserve it\nIf you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it\nGet in the zone of positivity, not negativity\nCuz we gotta strive for longevity\nIf you botch up, what's in that (ass) (what?)\nA pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half (come on, come on)\n\n\n\nWe gotta make moves\nNever, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)\n\n\"Time.. time is a ship on a merciless sea\nDrifting toward an average of nothingness\nUntil it can be retarded for it's own destiny\nTIME is an inanimate object\nPraying and praying and praying for ??\nTime is DANCING, moving lingering all memories of past..\"\nThe Last Poets\n\nYou gotta be a winner all the time\nCan't fall prey to a hip hop crime\nWith the dope raps and dope tracks for you for blocks\nFrom the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks\nMusically the Quest, is on the rise\nWe on these Excursions so you must realize\nthat continually, I pop my Zulu\nIf you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip\nSo what could you do in the times which exist\nYou can't fake moves on your brother or your sis\nBut if your sis is a (bitch), brother is a jerk\nLeave 'em both alone and continue with your work\nWhatever it may be in today's society\nEverything is fair, at least that how it seems to me\nYou must be honest and true to the next\nDon't be phony and expect one not to flex\nEspecially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen\nYour man is your man, then treat him like your friend\nAll it is, is the code of the streets\nSo listen to the knowledge bein dropped over beats\nBeats that are hard, beats that are funky\nIt could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie\nWhat you gotta do to is know that the Tribe is in the sphere\nThe Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare\n\n\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, it don't stop (uh!)\n\n\"Time is running out on black power Africans today\nand whites blacks and reporters at night\nEverytime you see them ?? with their tongues hangin out\nTime is running and past and passing and running\nRunning and past and passing and running (excursions)\"\n",
