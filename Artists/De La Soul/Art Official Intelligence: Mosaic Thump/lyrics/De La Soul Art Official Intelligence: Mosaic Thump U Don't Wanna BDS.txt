Fact of the matter my style will never fade
Managin to keep it all A-grade
So you can stay nourish and flourish with the truth

Bust some fuckin niggaz tryin to play me cra-zay
Causin interruptions to my big pay-day
Playin with them guns make them fuckin lea-ry

Shick shick, CLIK-A-CLIK
This is where my people headin at
Innocent people are carryin gats
Now what the fuck is all that?
Is it cause times is live like a wire
gettin shock treated by the crossfire
Ha-siyahh, burn bare well prepared
to make my decision for my livin
I ain't the one (Robin) I'm the one (Given)
Hip-Hop driven, and willin to die for it
When Scott LaRock died man I cried and shit
Then some cats got rich callin a woman a bitch
but ain't no woman like the one I got
and if you call her a bitch well you might get (BLAM)
And I know the feelings is mutual
It's uncivilized and unsuitable
Crips and bloods are recruitable


Ha ha, yeah you get the motherfuckin point, HUH?
You niggaz get the motherfuckin point, HUH?
That's right so while you niggaz is sittin up in central booking
Crying like bitches, HUH?

You ain't no real nigga, nigga
I'll smack the shit out of you

You sittin in central booking, cryin like a bitch
Waitin for your father, to come bail you out
