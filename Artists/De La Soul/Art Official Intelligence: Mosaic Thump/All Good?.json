Things ain't goin like you think they should\n\nA lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's\nAight then; here's a pair\nLace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me\nYou see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head\nTryin to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads\nupon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE\nSo mind your biz and walk away\ncause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze\n\nI don't care about what you think you see\nthe thangs you want to know when you look at me\nGod knows I done been there and paid my dues\nI can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-ohhhhh\n",
