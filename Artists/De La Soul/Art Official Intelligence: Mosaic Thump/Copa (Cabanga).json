(Word)\nBy-stand, I'm in the world fox-trottin\ngettin my Fred Astaire on, follow my lead girl\n\nMe and you come over, we\ndo it like the cha-cha, just\nlike we at the Cop-a, Ca-bang-a (uh-huh)\n\nFor all my niggaz runnin around like the mothership landed\nOr is it because there's some others who handed\ntheir daughters over to the night life\nYes we tryin to find a night wife to get wit\nInterface with they whole clique, I force the draft\nI get the first pick, run this easily\n?? rule like D, Joey and Jay\nAround the way, we're goin\nbut first tell all these women who ain't knowin\n\n\nYo.. I talk no shame upon this\nI got aim all on this to shoot and score the trout\nwho's actin all cute and out of position while I'm wishin\nto get her bottom limbs arched like a grasshopper\nPuttin in work to make it last proper\nNinety percent of the time is on my mindframe\nSo I'm game to reign up to par\nwhile my fam runs it cool up at the bar, I stay clearheaded\nLettuce enough cheese to get shredded\nWe like Navy Seals lookin for the gold\nOur natural appeal got them others on hold\nThem girls dealin with us tonight\nCame with the large appetite and got served\nGot nerve to think less, you can bless me and my kinfolk\nRushin up against my yolk-sac promote that\npimp play upon how we get it on for real!\n\n\nYou see you hopeless up in the spot\nTalkin a lot of champagne taste holdin 40 ounce pockets\nSwitch the sprocket to gear to top of the year\nWe gon' drop it like confetti on it, get ready on it\nHer fast ass wanna get all Andretti on it\nMakin my main man Poke like Trakmasterz\nBlazin-trail, we Portland to Nor-ton\n\"Honeymoon\" flicks don't exist in this\nI sip a little left to twist spines together\nVertical hold, we gon' combine together (yeah)\nEven if we spill the love\nwe got compliments up at the front door\nJust tell em Dullah sent ya\nThirty minute Tae*Bo shit's how I bench ya\nAll on a Saturday night, step to life\nI love the way Sally walk\nBow legged in a two piece steel, we live in New York\nWe live in New York\n",
