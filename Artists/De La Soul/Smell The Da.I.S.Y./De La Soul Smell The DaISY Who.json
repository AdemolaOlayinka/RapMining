(Brick City)\n\nYo, don't scandalize mine\nI spent too much time\nStraight talk with the catch to etch my line walk\nFetchin for crime, halt! Who goes there?\n\nYo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear\nShinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare\n\nWhile we rockin it, I'll rock in it\nLike the little ball inside the spray can\nProviding three coats for both child, woman and man\n\nGod bless them all, lay these Streets Wall to Wall\nWe go - oooh, {OWW!}, {\"World...Famous\"}\nYo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click\nIt went - {Oh my gosh...}\n\nIt ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt\nGot your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see\nWe outted out like a glass of tea\nBetter yet, oatmeal cooks, y'all just ROOKS to me\nSlidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D\nWhy try? Maseo been sky high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'\nMy topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game\nIt's life~! Afrocentric lovin was the past drug\nA life filled with (WOO) that's what thug's love\nShoot fast, ass\nDrug of your choice man, it muffles your voice, man\n\nNow when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold\nIf you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up\nWe run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss\nFlashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss\n\nMost crews are post-current while we're forever\nDirect beats that's contagious, (loved by all ages!)\nGraduated from the you-and-I-versity\nof hard-hitters, for real\n\nI got peoples in the streets that'll blast your ass for this beat\nAnd go - oooh, {OWW!} {\"Yo, that's fat!\"}\nYo, if you a big girl gettin your love between sheets\nGo - oooh, {oooh!}\nPut your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound\nAnd go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooooooh!\n{\"How do I work this??\"}\nUh, Marvin? {\"Ooooh!\"}\n",
