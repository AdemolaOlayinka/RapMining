    "lyrics": "Allow me.. to break it down.. ah yea yea yea yea yeahh..\nLife..\n\nThis is dedicated to all my folks\nDiagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin\nAnd never took the time to fall in line or follow\nor swallow the thoughts\nOf the recognized committees who lurk throughout ya cities\nYa hood, ya town, no matter which type\nYou from the same type of people try to hold you down\nJust because you tailor made for bigger and better things\nNever missed a chance to move ahead of things\nAnd what does it bring? I tell you for me\nit brought jealousy in back wounds from all the stabbin\nCats posin as my fan just to get grabbin what's mine\nI'm livin in times where my daughters are found around\nkids who can't afford thinkin caps\nBut always found drinkin raps and eatin off beats\nClaimin laws of the streets - but who made the laws?\nEverybody playin (Rebel) with no sign of a +Cause+\n\nWell I, feel the world around me\nI've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down\nYou've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be\nWhere you wanna go with your life\nWith your life..\n\nYo, I'm never singin the blues but findin the clues to maintain\nAnd I been blessed to reign supreme over nearly every dream\nI had, and I made it come true\nI'm an imperfect man and I'm holdin the clue\nto perfection, it doesn't seem to matter what direction I look\nI find people settin traps\nTryin to find the goal - without havin any maps\nEven friends of mine, jumped on line, just to become my adversary\nThey felt they were entitled to the dairy I made\nThey don't come to chill or behave\nAnd they got, toast ready to burn\nNot learnin to live, but they yearnin to take what you earn\n\nWell I, feel the world around me\nI've found, that others, will bring you down, just to be down\nYou see - you've got to make up your mind, where you wanna be\nAnd where you wanna go with your life\nWith your life..\n\nSo quick to place blame.. and deny the shame we bring upon ourselves\nSo many names held accountable for my own account\nWhen a large amount was weight - that I made and shaped\nWhen I climbed I found\nIt was hard to find others around to point my fingers at\nWhich made me realize the truth\nThe biggest supressor could be your own ego lookin for an excuse\nto plant roots, in a field of self-sorrow\nto sprout and follow the first thing you feel\nNourishes your hunger to be respected, it gets hectic\nAnd when I'm watchin the news, and my daughter walks in\nand choose to ask, \"Why were all those people on the floor\nsleepin, covered in red?\" I told her\nthat they were lookin for God, but found religion instead\n\nWell I, feel the world around me\nI've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down\nYou see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be\nAnd where you wanna go with yo' life\nWith your life, with your life..\n\n\nI need my SPAAAACE, to live..\nWell I, feel the world around me\nI've found, that others, will bring you down; just to be down\nYou see, you've got to make up yo' mind, where you wanna be\nAnd where you wanna go with yo' life\nWith your life, with your life..\n",
