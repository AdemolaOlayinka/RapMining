    "lyrics": "Dave, whattup man?\nIt's me\nUmm.. just callin to see, if possible, if you have any\ntime today or within the next couple of days\nIf, if, you're in the studio.. or if you're at home.. or car, whatever\nThat song.. that.. it's called trying or something, Mase\nwas tellin me that I needed to hear?\nHe said it was amazing\nWhoo.. the way he was talkin.. man I wanna hear it!\n\nAm I just another lost in the pack?\nWe for shack ship, you know laugh it off\nYears just blow by\nMy eyes stay fixed but the picture's kinda outta focus\nI cry a lot but admit to it\nEnjoyin life now but I've been through it\nSometimes I wish that I can go back\nNo bills no kids just getting tore back\nI want a wife, I love women\nHow could I front like I don't be in love wit em?\nA li'l man that I can teach\nA li'l sand but not the beach\nI figure excess'll only bring an excessive amount of fussin\nSo when I'm gone, make sure the head stone reads, \"He did it for us\"\nI'm like your modern day Jesus\nI cherish warm thoughts like a gray goose\nAnd float soft kisses to my baby\n(yo ain't that Dave's little girl?)\nYeah, respect her for that\nShe gon be somebody\nInstead of somebody-baby-mama\nYou see young minds are now made of armor\nI'm tryin to pop a hole in your Yankee cap\nAbsorb me\nThe skies over your head aint safe no more\nAnd Hip Hop aint your own\nAnd if it is then you fuckin up the crib son\nYou make life look like I don't wanna live one\nYou might as well hold your breath until you die in a\ncorner somewhere bent over in the crevice\nThis God Theory overcomes the worst of weathers\nAs long as you willin to try, you on a good start homie\n.. you on a good start.. see nigga tryin\n\nPeople are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nAre you really ready?\nWe wanna be ready!\nReady for the change that may approach you?\nYes!\nFollow down the path that you supposed to?\nYes!\nPeople are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nAre you really ready to try?\nWe wanna try harder!\nYou know mistakes are trials that we learn from?\nYes!\nI order to live life, you must earn one?\nYes!\nPeople are you ready?\n\nThroughout my change to grow, Some of my people got left behind\nThey didn't listen for the gun, as I leaped from off the line\nThirteen years deep in this marathon I'm runnin\nPaid dues and still got bills to pay\nWhen I came back around the way\nOld friends gave me dead eyes\nand fake smiles, half wide\nWe were supposed to rid the world of danger\nThese days we nod heads and small talk like polite strangers\nIt's natural to fall off, just land close to the tree\nI'll be there if they need me to be\nand I know all my local shorties\ncuz they all know who I am\nand latey wanna flip grammar instead of grams\nLike that's the only choice they got\nThey tell me how they gonna shake up the game\nbut came to me to see if I could give em guidance for change\nShit y'all, I need guidance myself\nand I chisel right words to make gems\nGot fans around the world, but my girl's no one of em\nAnd my relationship's a big question\nCuz my career's a clear hindrance to her progression\nSaid she needs a man and our kids need a father\nI'm not at all ready to hear her say don't bother\nAnd break\nAnd this I know I can't take\nbut uhh\nC. Smith said to hold on\nMy brother Luck said to hold on\nMy nigga Dave said to hold on\nMy nigga Mase said to hold on\nYo, Maseo, we need to hold on\nEh, yo, y'all we need to hold on\n\nPeople are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nWell, what you wanna be?\nWe wanna be ready!\nDo you wanna lose hate for love?\nYes!\nDo you wanna see these gates above?\nYes!\nI said people are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nBut are you willing to try?\nWe wanna try harder!\nDo you really wanna carry some weight?\nYes!\nAre you ready to design your fate?\nYes!\nYo, people are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nWell what you wanna be?\nWe wanna be ready!..\n\nOperation complete. Preparing for.. Installment three\n",
