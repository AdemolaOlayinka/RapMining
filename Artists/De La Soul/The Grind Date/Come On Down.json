You're botherin me G\nI got shit to do right now, aight?\nThis is for De La Soul, y'knahmsayin?\nWord up I got shit to do you test tube baby!\nCheck one two, check one two\nDe La Soul, is now back on the map\nLong Island, is now back on the map\nGood rap music, is now back on the map\nYo check one two, this is the voice of yours truly the Flava Flav\nAnd I just want y'all to know, we ain't goin nowhere\nOld school is here to stay BOY!\n\nOn the outskirts, of what works\nLive those who go for broke, and merk to get merked\nLive by the sword and die by the semi\nNot part of my ways, but stays right in my\nN.Y. mentality for me to be the best\nThe current, the ones who weren't\npressed, to confess lies over hot joints\nto sell to all who wanna hear some\n(Young'uns these days got fireproof eardrums!)\nThey don't give a SHIT who's hot\nJust long as you're not, pussy, and be the would-be King\nBut once crowned, the same wanna pull you down\n(And what makes the world go 'round!!)\nAnd I be the world renowned Wonder Why\nWonderin why you can't stand me\nIs it because I'm the main Jackson\nand y'all just Titos and Randys? (Yes, it is!)\nBless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last\nAt the same time, I want respect and cash\nAnd a few paragraphs in them books\nTellin you how us Native Tongues made hits with no hooks\nRapped in every prefixes, gave birth to rap remixes back in '88\nNo disrespect to Diddy just settin it straight\nInstead of zig-zaggin, got a degree in braggin\nMy daughter says I'm a teen, cause like a teen\nmy pants always saggin and I walk with a bop\nThe part of my time, I walked from my pop\nNo longer on timey and was never on Loud\nBut cooked rhymes that make the Chefs of Wu proud\nI'm top cloud to rain on your show\nAnd still \"anything goes when it comes to hoes\" because\n\nMusic (c'mon) New York (c'mon) Detroit (c'mon) c'mon down!\nMiami (c'mon) L.A. (c'mon) Vegas (c'mon) c'mon down!\nBoston (c'mon) Tucson (c'mon) Long Island (c'mon) c'mon down!\nV.A. (c'mon) Portland (c'mon) Chi-Town (c'mon) c'mon down!\n\nMake you shake like, sunshine, naked shoe was once mine\nHad bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids\nFix your playground player or some kids'll\ncome stomp in your sandbox, swollen hands cocked back\nNo knives, no drama, no guns\nNo disrespectin your seed or Ma Dukes\nI puke rhyme and you laugh, take a sniff\nof these fricaseed raps on Carribean riffs\nSee last night's change was today's dough money\nNo time for your freestyles so roll money\nNo more whack albums with two joints\nNo more ballplayin rappers who shoot ya two points\n(No more G cause I'm sick of your hip-hop!)\nYour flows bore like seashores with no bitches\nSwitchhittin niggaz will receive no pitches\nNo diamonds on the field, just keep the game real\nsimple, see the God flows healthy\nWealth in the mind is like money in the bank\nExchange cash like thoughts in conversation\nThank you for your purchases, we dough out\nand roll out the Kool-Aid, see us pimp strut\nAin't really pimpin, I'm tryin to catch the bus\nThe Krush Groove ain't got shit on Cold Crush!\nWe dolly dolly babies cause we shootin cats\n'Back to the Future' rap with Doc Brown shotgunnin it\nAnd pantyhose your whole style and start runnin it\nYou dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello\nThe mush-in-your-room son, we stay portobello\nCan't settle for the same picket white fence\nI got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa\nStill push the truck with the factories pa\nI'm bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out, make 'em shout\n\nD.C. (c'mon) Oakland (c'mon) U.K. (c'mon) c'mon down!\nNew Orleans (c'mon) Little Rock (c'mon) B-More (c'mon) c'mon down!\nMemphis (c'mon) Utah (c'mon) Jersey (c'mon) c'mon down!\nAtlanta (c'mon) Brooklyn (c'mon) Philly (c'mon) c'mon down!\n\nYeah that's right! Flava Flav, with De La Soul\nAct bold, and we knock you straight up in the hole\nY'knahmsayin? Six feet deep, that's the way that we keep, rollin\nY'knahmsayin? Operation tech sensation in the nation\nReady to take it to Penn Station, y'knahmsayin?\nYeah, ah ha ha ha\nLong Iz one is, that's where we is man\nDe La Soul, you done it again!\nDe La Soul, you done it again!\nDe La Soul, you done it again!\nFlava Flava, De La Soul, you done it again!\n",
