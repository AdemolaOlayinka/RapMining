Microwave popcorn-ass niggaz\nYeah, we give you much more, longevity baby\nAiyyo Dave\n\nYo! It's been instilled in me since infinite y'all\nUsin these minutes like I value the call\nPut your money in the bank, and hold rank\nover friends who ain't got leadership skills\nI got the sheep in my eyes so I can't sleep\nWe like the, land and laid, the brand old way\nGrand operate the scandal way, L.I. sheist\nI play the X-Box instead of fuckin with dice\nI hate losin to those who walk away with my dough\ncause I dozed, Tracy broke me\nAnd now she wanna see the resident provokin me\nto pop wheelies on my bicycle, watch her eyes twinkle\nOne house, two houses, third house\nHouse rules so house take bank, watch Dave bank\nBanner had 'em on the hawk since Atlanta extravaganza\nGamma ray rap I make the Hulk snap\nJump back like James Brown, hey now\nWhen the liquor over we smokin the hay now\nDelegatin numero dos, I holla out the sound of los\nAnd keep the Island close to me\n\nMuch more is what we got in store\nJust believe me\n\"And what we have is much more than they can see\"\nMuch more than they can see\nis how it'll always be, believe me (gotta believe)\n\"And what we have is much more than they can see\"\n\nI got verb skills, babies and bills, brothers who smoke krills\nand still tryin to get himself together from it\nKnowin he can't quite run it like me\nI'm on the cutting edge of what's alleged to be, hot\nAnd when you rock, it's just impersonations of me\nThe rightest MC, MP with the V in the middle\nI belittle your plan, courtesy, of NY dirty C my man\nMy base of fans are made up of many; with kids allergic\nto belts lettin they mind melt from drinkin the Henny\nAnd them straight and narrow types who be waitin to hear\nthem drums say the revolution is near - are you listening?\nAre your eardrums open for christening?\nWe God Body MC's with these tools\nWhile some others play God, they just God damn fools with it\nI don't cuff mics, I rough mics up rough and rugged\nGet the girls to love it\nStill and all five-oh came to my mic check\nTellin me I left lacerations around my mic's neck\nDomestically disputed and you just might get\nthe undisputed underdog servin y'all threat\n\n\"And what we have is much more than they can see\"\n\"And what we have is much more than they can see..\"\n",
