(Biofeedback) 


Ya go beats, meats, son Sheep 
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat 
I got multiple stabs of jazzy 
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul 
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly 
I plugged for the Tunin' 
Which cause eyes to zoom in 


Which put your person into focus 


No longer Kelvin Mercer but the Posdnuos 
Plug One yo I found fun 
In the scribblin' of speak 
On a naked white sheet 
Most recognized by my dark brown self 


Yo you found some wealth? 


More in my mind than in my pocket 
But I's got every Girbaud that ever sagged 
I met some hoes, met some girls 
Did a tour that took me all around the world 


Did a tour that took me all around the world 

 
I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now 
Remember when the floor might have had a spine 
Well it's all bent over 
The DayGlo nigga gets the red door mat 
It's a roller coaster 
When your shit's burnt toast 
Now Mr. Club Owner knows your jam 
When your jam is tha jam 
And there's a tab at the bar 
My mindstate's great 
No thanks I don't drink 
I sip the bobo 
Then I kettle it quick 
I felt the heave in the jeave 
Tap it in the basement 
Diggin' my own understanding quick 
Let me get the single out 
Think Mr. Radio say the starlight 
Is the same star bright 
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch 
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch 
It was one MC after one MC 
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite 
Well it's okay and it's alright 
Cause our birthday cake's external light 
It'll all get graphic 
People made of plastic 
Look at the shine wit my 50 watt eye 
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch 
I fame it to a name from Denver up to Maine 
And lovin' deluxe 
She won't catch me in no tux 
Nah, man I won't honor the style 

(Curious, curious, curious, curious) 
 How you doing, my name is Dres, listen... 
 Isn't that Posdnuos? Oh, my... 
 Baby, what's wrong with me? 

 
Funny funny how time flies 
When you have some light on the face 
Cause the focus is the fickle 
'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it 
To the utilize the trickle caught the rush 
But I play hush 
While Andres Titus is the grabbin' 
As a fan will put the hearts to mush 
Lush Dalea would hear the public beat 
The same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep 
But as the Knee went Deep 
To deeper off the charts 
The album faded to black 
That's when the amnesia starts 

(Curious, curious, curious, curious) 
 Aren't you Dres from Black Sheep? What are you doing here? Who
are you here with? 
 I'm with my man Pos, you know Pos... 
 Oh yeah, Positive K, I.. I like him... 

(Stickabush, stickabush, stickabush, stickabush) 

 
Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in 
Should I shot it or begin 
I saw bootleggas no shinin' 
I saw Big 4 go get shinin' 
A typical flick was the moment 
When the man said 
"Ain't you?" Yeah I is 'im 
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog 
Caught the light being True dog 
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen 
In the scene or in between 
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight 
I mail my ass to the darkness 
I dig it, I dug it 
I dig it, I dug it 
I wiz it, I was it 
I wiz it, I was it 
Oh Lord let me switch it off 
Because ya find some'll do it all 
For the light 
(Stop jivin')
