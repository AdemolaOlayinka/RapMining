Oodles and oodles of O's, you know 
You get 'em from my sister 
You get 'em from my bro 
All I is is man, and once an embryo 
Am I solid gold? I don't cast a glow 
Yes, I guess it's reflex 
Some have no control 
I'd rather let a laughter 
And tally, off I go 
Canoeing in the river or out into the O 
You just know we're not 
So not play the role 
Some are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazy crow 
Some shake your hand but 
(This is called the Show) 
I was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Jolico' 
Pissed with the witness, and now I adore 
O's got the world 'cause O's was on tour 
Girls gave the O's and guys, oh for sure 
Where they arose, well nobody knows 
What do they mean, well here's how it goes 
Oh shoot's got the O's when you hold the dough 
You know who you are but they didn't know 
And now with respect they flex like a pro 
You're first another nigger but now an Afro 

Oodles and oodles of O's and 
Oodles and oodles and oodles of O's ya know 
They givin' oodles of O's and O's 
And oodles and oodles and oodles of O's ya know 
They givin' oodles of O's and O's 
And oodles and oodles and oodles of 
(OH!) 

 
Last of the fast Plug pipers at the door 
In your eye, burning like rubbing alcohol 
Native is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomo 
Kinfolk will play this in stere-ere-o 
Chanters play the part of a herd at a show 
Pos prints the peace on his jeans or Jebos 
But let the herd know if beef they wanna throw 
Lunches of punches is what I bestow 
Oodles of O's has the "Hoo's" in mic checks 
O's take the shape of medallions and specs 
Don't forget the O's that let the air in my nose 
Breathe in the fresh as the stale hit the road 
Girls ask for flicks and unblock the pores 
Eat the Al Greens, won't sniff the ker-plows 
Mase got something to say and it goes: 
(Maseo is rockin' on the radio) 

Now I think we're talkin' 'bout the oodles of O's 
Ya know, I think we're talkin' 'bout the 
Oodles of O's, yeah 
We're talkin' 'bout the oodles of O's ya know 
I think we're talkin' 'bout the oodles of O's 
I think we're talkin' 'bout the oodles of O's 
Ya know, I think we're talkin' 'bout the 
(Oh, shit) 

Hoods like to play my Joe, ya know 
Guns goin' "bo!" people hit the floor 
Don't have a piece but an arrow and bow 
Target it firm 'cause I'm head Comancho 
Charging barricades like a raging rhino 
The donuts come big and some in jumbo 
The Landlord is finished but before I go 
I'll give a shout out to Quest 
And my fellow Jungle Bro's 


Knocked by the dock of the bay by the shore 
Swimmin' in the rhythm of the hi-de-hi-de-ho 
Punk Pinocchios gotta go, gotta go 
(What's the reason?) to be cheerful 
Season is breeze, time to pimp promo 
Nuts can no flow if the shade is in the dough 
On with me hat, d-d-duh-duh-doh, 
Dredlock is heading out the door y'all 

We're selling O's, y'all 
We're selling O's and O's 
We're selling O's at the corner store y'all 
We're selling O's, y'all 
We're selling oodles and oodles and oodles 
And oodles of O's, y'all 
We're selling O's, y'all, at the corner store 
We're selling O's at the corner store, y'all 
We're selling O's, y'all, at the corner store 
We're selling O's and O's and O's, O's, y'all 
We're selling oodles and oodles of O's, y'all 
We're selling oodles and oodles of O's, y'all 
We're selling oodles and oodles...
