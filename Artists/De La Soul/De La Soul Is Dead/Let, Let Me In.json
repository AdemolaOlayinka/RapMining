What could it be?\nShe, she (watchin' you) who, me?\nHon, Velveeta got your cut\n(Ain't no lockin' up now)\nGive the symmetrics to your bottom\n(Ain't no lockin' up)\nShake less of that Catholic cool\nPush panic, the button, and freeze\nA's for Amen, J's for the Jenifa\nOh Jennys, oh please oh please\n(Oh please oh please)\n\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\n\n\nForce it like a motion, let me in to that\nFlower power child, let me in to that\nLet me sew your panic button, let me in to that\nI got the semen headlocked, you won't get fat\nJust lay, lay back, way, way, way\nThe oops up, it's a clear Saturday\nWe're selling my all-expense July paid\nBy the way, what's your name?\nJust kidding, I know it's Renee\nNo, it isn't? Word, word, well check it out\nCheck, check it out\nI got my my mind made up, come on, get it\nTake a test, child\nAnd get with this Pos position\nFrom beginning to the Huckleberry Fin\nIf I was to yodel, would you let me in?\n\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\n\nPos got the skyrocket in his jeans\nWould you let me in if I was to sing\nLike a hookey-non-stop-reggae-roost-rasta-king\nJimmy done starburst, know what I mean\nJimmy done burst, gotta come clean\nYo, Maseo, blow this scene\n\n\nDip, dip, di, you're making me cry\nWith that onion between your thighs\nCome give me some of that brown sugar\nSo the sweets can make me active\nIf I said you were attractive\nMay I supplement with an additive?\nHey, hooker let me hook you with my reel\nTake you to the crib, cook up a real meal\nSkip the meal and walk this way\n(Hey, hey, hey)\nCome on into my room, here we go\nHere we here we here we go\n(Boom!) Did you feel the bed break?\n(Boom!) Did you feel the floor shake?\n(Boom!) Did you feel the earth quake?\n(Boom!) Now, quick, do you wanna take a break?\n\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\nLet, let me in, let, let me in\n\n(What's this?)\n(What?)\n(In your pocket, that bulge?)\n(Hey, hey, hey!)\n(Harry, let me see it)\n(Jumping jehosaphat!)\n(Quaggin', quakin' and shakin')\n(And that's no fakin')\n(Let me see the gun, Harry, I want to see if it's been fired)\n(Why are you complaining? I've always given you a piece of the action)\n\n(So he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed)\n(And at last he blew the house in)\n",
