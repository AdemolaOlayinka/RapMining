De La Soul
3 Feet High And Rising
1989)
Please listen to this simple De La style I'm gonna sing 
It's strongly directed to all the misery you're bringing 
Now I'm not all about dissing someone else personnel 
But there's no quota on your odor 
That's right, you smell 
Now you might feel a little embarassed, don't take it too hard 
And don't make it worse by covering it up with some Right Guard 
Before you even put on your silk shirt and fat gold rope 
Please take your big ass to the bathroom 
And please use 
(A little bit of soap....)
