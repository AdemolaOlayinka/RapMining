    "lyrics": "\"Good morning heartache, it's a pleasure to meet you\"\nI said staring in the mirror in search of weakness\nShit am I the loose link? Madam Medus ink?\nPace movin slower than a statue frozen\nStarving artist, more like hostage\nEasily composed in mail and poastage\nMailbox empty though, no respondents\nChasin condiments, I need to catch up/ketchup\nBeats are bangin, but ain't no bangin back\nSorry Charlie, no gold ticket\n(Cricket, cricket) Sound bites are hunger\nPut so much work in, but ain't no work out\nand ain't no ringtone in lonely doubt's ears\nIt's lonely out here, phony out here\nlike T.I. (U Don't Know Me) out here\nA smidgen of set-back sets in..\n\nFor weeks we wore the game face travellin place to place\nConventions (seminars) talent shows near and far\nTravelled the south to let them know the name\nOut THEY mouth shout a ghost of Ichabod Crane\nYo, could it be that we ain't good D?!\nNah, they just hatin (or really ain't relatin)\nFeelin a little homesick, rather be at home with\nthem corner boys talkin that everyday home shit\nBut when at the crib, anxiety sets in\nI didn't set a \"Plan B\", understand me?\nWe need to get a hold on \"Plan A\"\nCause I'm NOT tryin to live on minimum pay\n(This shit is takin too long yo) Yeah I told you bro\nThe old man's at the crib like \"I told you so\"\nAnd mom's still prayin, I hope she ask God to\nopen them doors to the game so we can get the play in\n\nThe second act curtains almost by nature\nThe wage is mental, bettin this won't happen\nChange in the caption is not for captain\nNeither co-pilot, the colder silent\nand in creeps Miss Doubt-fire's comfort\nTits danglin in front of, tanglin my thoughts\nDeparts from confines of my confidence\nBroken egos, small disasters\nEven in plaster, limbs will not heal\nI'm armin myself, charming I self\nLord and Master, show me a sign\nNot for nothin Lord, show me\n\nWasn't it good with that Spalding\nbut excellent with the golf clubs\nScream WHOOOA!! Smash the window to the car door\n(Reach in) grab, sprint back to the lab\nYou would think I didn't have any sense\nbut my sense of worth was still growin, so was my dreams\nof being kids from Queens beings managed by Lyor Cohen\nand Russell Rush (Rick Rubin doin them beats)\nA month later on stage with Adidas on my feet\nbut right now worry's on my mind\nI'm still gon' climb (not stoppin) if the beats stop rockin\nI'll beat hand and fist with skills on the table\nHello?\n\nNIGGA!! Kindoo said we got the deal with the label, B!\n\nWHAAT?\n\nMy word!\n\nDon't fuck with me man, you playin!\n\nNah I'm not playin, (YOU) playin!\nNigga I'm goin shoppin\nWe on Goon Time, bitch!\nSee you at the mall\n",
