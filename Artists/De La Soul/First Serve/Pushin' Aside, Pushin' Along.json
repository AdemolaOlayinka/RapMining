    "lyrics": "I'ma get to be the king of New York\nWhen the queen and the crib be killing my nights\nAnd a horse rode in her\nShe swear the fresh prince gonna fail\nParents just don't understand\nI'm just trying to get my kid on\nPosing in the mirror design\nA stone chizzling the dmc, a pedigree m\nA better me then\nShit I'm chasing this bus\nOnce we get on peak it's all about us\nYeah but you can be a lawyer, put them down father boy\nSory ma', I'm a microphone fiend,\nAddicted of the concept of rolling with a team\nAnd rolling up sleeves in some boss' office\nThat all the mind of another man\nSwitch that on the...up to this other plan\nBut she snap back at me like a rubber band\nMore concern cause she swim in the gutter\nI just wanna cop her a crib and pops, well I don't know him\nHis position on the build is a veto\nAll our asses I'll be treated like an equal\nCome on mom\nThrough the doubt and the stress\nMy eyes stay glue\nIf it all goes wrong,\nI'll push it aside\nI'll keep pushin' along\nThrough the stress and no other doubt\nMy eyes are so glued to it\nLike the words in the song\nWe just pusin' aside, pushin' along\nYep, attention from the parents\nThey just want the best, they want your ass up in...without falling\nExplain it to them it is my calling\nIt's like wearing a pack that has a parachute that might not open\nAnd anyways, this shouldn't even be descended\nIn they mind, up world, with your wings extended\nFlight time is the best way,\nBut I'm listening to what my heart and my chest say\nI want the rap game, my mama wanna...me\nPops like, don't even spend another day on it\nHe keeps putting me down,\nSay I'm riding with my hobby in the front seat\nResponsibilities in the trunk and really need to just switch it around\nUnplug the dream, push it along\nWith talents in these streets is pusher of song\nPut smiles on the pretty girls' face\nAnd ... dudes embrace, when he's giving me that\nYou can see it in they eyes that this nigga can rap\nBut my father, said I need a real blue color\nCan't support a family with a few dollars\nBut the damage is done, your son's a fiend\nFor microphone and break beats and drum machines\nFor large crowd yelling out Pop and Dean\nIt's swerve from the first serve making them lean\nThrough the doubt and the stress\nMy eyes stay glue\nIf it all goes wrong,\nI'll push it aside\nI'll keep pushin' along\nThrough the stress and no other doubt\nMy eyes are so glued to it\nLike the words in the song\nWe just pusin' aside, pushin' along\nThey'll like more pain, problem, more stress\nI'm like, more lanes, albums, more bless\nThey like, not cheering it, not even hearing it\nWhen I talk about I'm trying to be a pioneer in it\nThey're like this not the real job to fall on\nI'm like it's what my soul seems to call on\nI wanna hear them say Jay we support you\nBut still in all I gotta do what I gotta do\nYeah, and I'ma ride with them... let this doggy doggy step outside\n... the ... I used to slam doors shut\nMister parental advisor he was keeping his eyes on me\nBut this little piggy's trying to tell the world\nWith the blessing from his number one girl, I can do this mom\nThrough the doubt and the stress\nMy eyes stay glue\nIf it all goes wrong,\nI'll push it aside\nI'll keep pushin' along\nThrough the stress and no other doubt\nMy eyes are so glued to it\nLike the words in the song\nWe just pusin' aside, pushin' along\n",
