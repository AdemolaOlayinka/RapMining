Won't you stay babe?\n\nOh, I never know what come around, I never looked ahead\nA r 's pulling us down, the words I wished I'd said\nShadow you're drawn and you got your ways\nShadow you're painted red\nRed\nMoving afar, rolling away\nIn the corner, believe, why won't you stay?\nWon't you stay babe? Won't you stay babe?\nIt's drawn\n\nOne, two\nYo, I'm with the paper plate, hold\nToo many dreams, a paperweight took a toll\nFoot on the floor, not on the wasted\nOr what's being pasted and know that it's not a copy\nI own a prize instead of gas price\nLyrically wonder why I travel past the nicest\nBorn in a generation that don't generate patience\nI travel too fast for you to clock me (time)\nNot always a good thing\nYou can lose the love of your life to a lifetime of love on tour\nI didn't mean to be a whore but my hormones\nHad me like a fiend screamin' \"What you got for me?\"\nTwo words (I'm mortal)\nBut the fans lift 'em both together and remove the apostrophe\nHip hop's lords maybe but my ways needs laundering\nTime's a-ticking, stop squandering!\n",
