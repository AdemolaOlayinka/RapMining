    "lyrics": "Fresh from a bible belt town\nThat's what she's givin' up\nNot really livin', just flesh comin' off a greyhound\nRight at a blink of an eye he provides her with charm\nHides that he is a shark\nSuggests a few apartments, never hints to the home\nThat's what he wanna do\nShe just wanna new zip code for an old dream\nLost in an appetite now the big apple might\nFind her habit of a queen\nFeel the negro that's filled with an equal match road\nDestination unknown\nShe's Little Bow Peep\nAnd her and her whole sheep gonna have their wool unsewn\nNow the wolf give a push\nNow watch her jump in with two feet\nBlue heat don't know how to swim through the limbs\nEveryone huggin' her, tuggin' her\nRide on the merry-go-round of four drinks and two white lines\nGo fast with the fast life so she needs more\nOne fun fix, now a daily chore\nProvide the score, written and produced so perverse\nHe's a pro well versed\nTold her that the purse that she want\nWith the shoes that she love and the rent that she need paid\nCan be earned with speed in a day\nEscort on the high class side\nChampagne glass rides\nWhite snow waterfalls, oh how time flies\nWhen you're flyin', crash and burn\nShe learned that her soul was dyin'\nThat's worth savin'\nShe's cravin' that bible belt town\nSo she crawls back on the Greyhound\n\nNext stop, NYC\nTake your seats please\nI know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face\nI know how to get there\nAnd I give you my word that I get you there safe\nI don't need to check your baggage\nI don't need to know your name\nAll I need to know is\nBy the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed\n\nFresh new Gucci belt, bound\nFast to the city scape\nDash to deliver fate\nStashed in this duffel bag, proud\nIt's no scaredy cat\nLife was always spared in thy name\nThat the gamblers fold\nNo chips if the scramble got cold\nBut them warm cushions and them soft bus seats\nPush that second thought along\nBeneath the roof of a Super 8, he sleeps till it's night time\nThen connects in the streets like a pipe line\nIn dark shades he supplies dark brigades\nOf lost souls with his chemical morsels\nHe's no lab tech\nHe was born into a legacy stretched from Aztecs and beyond\nAssets he was drawn to\nHad him spreadin' the wool over his mother's eye\nHe's the black sheep\nHis pops career driven, he's the backseat\nThe man on the wheel that cruises on sunrise\nThat the man brought eyes to his pay per view\nKind of paper make a fool shoot his statement through\nAnd take the label too\nTill he's can't\nTill a pancake pocket change the landscape\nTake a short visit home in the town\nIt's time to re-up, it's back on the Greyhound\n\nNext stop, NYC\nTake your seats please\nI know exactly where you're goin', I can see it on your face\nI know how to get there\nAnd I give you my word that I get you there safe\nI don't need to check your baggage\nI don't need to know your name\nAll I need to know is\nBy the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed\nBy the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed\nBy the time you arrive, you'll forever be changed\nForever be changed, forever be changed\nSo watch where you're goin'\nAnd this food you're chosin'\nI don't need to check your baggage\nI don't need to know your name\nAll I need to know is\nBy the time you arrive you'll forever be changed\nForever be changed, be changed\nYou'll forever be changed\n",
