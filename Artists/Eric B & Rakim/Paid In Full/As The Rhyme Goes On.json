    "lyrics": "Knowledge will begin until I finish this song\n'Cuz the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on\nYou sweat as you step about to get hype\nOr should you just listen to the man on the mic\nYou're physically in this with me but how could you tell\nIf it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well\nReady to absorb the rhyme that I just poured\nInto the mic and so unite and this won't be so bored\nIf you just keep kickin' listen - to the mix\nAnd think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand\nHolds and controls you 'til I leave\nYou fall deeper in the style - it's hard to breathe\nThe only time I stop is when somebody drop and then\nBring 'em to the front 'cuz my rhymes' the oxygen\nThen wave your hands - when you're ready I'll send you\nInto your favorite dance so let the rhyme continue\nAnd so on and I'ma go on simultaneously\nAnd even if I stop - the rhyme remains to be\nRising to the top - and I came to drop it\nCatch it and quiz it - is my topic\nUniversual 'cuz I move everybody to come\nBy exercising your mind you'll coincide as one\nYou look around and see how packed the party starts to get\nI draw a crowd - like an architect\nThe five borroughs react and all the islands attract\nAnd every state can't wait - so they attack\noff a spot on the floor - squeeze in cuz it's packed\nIt'll be more room if MC's play the back\nI'm the R the A to the K-I-M\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am\nThe microphone fiend if I was a fake\nWhoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make\nI had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite\nSung it on stage some said it don't sound like\nThe voice on the record - I see what you mean\nBecause the system was wack, so I had to scream\nSo just - give me a mic if it's loud I'll blow it\nIf not - into the crowd I'll throw it\nPull out my cordless mic and entertain you well\nBefore I let go I'ma spark your brain cells\nI took time to write - tonight I will recite\nSo poetically inclined when the mic is held tight\nRhymes start flowin' kisses are blowin\nMC's are knowin' that's why they're goin\nHome to tell a friend when the party ends\n\"Yo, man you know Rakim? That brother struck again\"\nCuz mic by mic and stage by stage,\nTape by tape and page by page,\nWhen the crowd is moving I compete with the mix\nThe rougher the cuts - the rougher the rhyme gets\nDeeper and Deeper - I hope you understand it\nI made it up myself and I planned it\nFor other MC's who waste time\nWriting jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme\nI cross my arms and I was waiting - but I was hating\nThe rappers on the microphone was fronting - just faking\nThey wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'\nTo get up on the microphone and then start takin'\nControl of the mic - uptight when I grabbed it\nSo hug the speaker- your ear's a magnet\nAttracted to a freestyle put in effect\nYou listen to my man while you're sippin' Moet\nSo Eric, pick up the needle (yeah) put it in the middle (ahhight)\nGive me a scratch, turn my Mic up a little,\nI want you to hear this perfectly clear\nCatch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?\nI hope you knowledge the beginning cuz I'm finished this song\nThe rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on...\n",
