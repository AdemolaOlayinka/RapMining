We rollin' with Rush\nOf Rushtown Management\nCheck this out, since we talking over\nThis def beat right here that I put together\nI wanna hear some of them def rhymes, you know what I'm sayin'?\nAnd together, we can get paid in full\nThinkin' of a master plan\n'Cuz ain't nuthin' but sweat inside my hand\nSo I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent\nSo I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint\nSo I start my mission, leave my residence\nThinkin' how could I get some dead presidents\nI need money, I used to be a stick-up kid\nSo I think of all the devious things I did\nI used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuthin' funny\nStop smiling, be still, don't nuthin' move but the money\nBut now I learned to earn 'cuz I'm righteous\nI feel great, so maybe I might just\nSearch for a nine to five, if I strive\nThen maybe I'll stay alive\nSo I walk up the street whistlin' this\nFeelin' out of place 'cuz, man, do I miss\nA pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of\nMe and Eric B, and a nice big plate of\nFish, which is my favorite dish\nBut without no money it's still a wish\n'Cuz I don't like to dream about gettin' paid\nSo I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made\nSo now to test to see if I got pull\nHit the studio, 'cuz I'm paid in full\nRakim, check this out, yo\nYou go to your girl house and I'll go to mine\n'Cause my girl is definitely mad\n'Cause it took us too long to do this album\nYo, I hear what you're saying\nSo let's just pump the music up\nAnd count our money\nYo, well check this out, yo Eli\nTurn down the bass down\nAnd let the beat just keep on rockin'\nAnd we outta here\nYo, what happened to peace?\nPeace\n",
