    "lyrics": "Follow me into a solo\nGet in the flow - and you can picture like a photo\nMusic mixed mellow maintains to make\nMelodies for MC's motivates the breaks\nI'm everlastin, I can go on for days and days\nWith rhyme displays that engrave deep as X-rays\nI can take a phrase that's rarely heard, FLIP IT\nNow it's a daily word\nI can get iller than 'Nam, a killin bomb\nBut no alarm - Rakim will remain calm\nSelf-esteem make me super superb and supreme\nBut for a microphone still I fiend\nThis was a tape I wasn't supposed to break\nI was supposed to wait, but let's motivate\nI want to see who can keep followin and swallowin\nTakin the making, bitin it and borrowin\nBrothers tried and others died to get the formula\nBut I'ma let ya sweat - you still ain't warm\nYou a step away from frozen, stiff as if ya posin\nDig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen\nSo follow me and were ya thinkin' you were first?\nLet's travel at magnificent speeds around the Universe\nWhat could ya say as the Earth gets further and further away\nPlanets are small as balls of clay\nAstray into the Milky Way - world's outasight\nFar as the eye can see - not even a satellite\nNow stop and turn around and look\nAs ya stare in the darkness, ya knowledge is took!\nSo keep starin soon ya suddenly see a star\nYou better follow it cause it's the R\nThis is a lesson if ya guessin and if ya borrowin\nHurry hurry step right up and keep followin\nThe Leader\n\n\nThis is a lifetime mission, vision of prison\nAight listen\nIn this journey you're the journal I'm the journalist\nAm I Eternal? Or an eternalist?\nI'm about to flow long as I can possibly go\nKeep ya movin cause the crowd said so\nDance - cuts rip ya pants\nEric B on the blades, bleedin to death - call the ambulance\nPull out my weapon and start to squeeze\nA magnum as a microphone murderin' MC's\nLet's quote a rhyme from a record I wrote\n(follow the leader) Yeah - dope\nCause everytime I stop it seems ya stuck\nSoon as ya try to step off ya self-destruct\nI came to overcome before I'm gone\nBy showin and provin and lettin knowledge be born\nThen after that I'll live forever - you disagree?\nYou say never? Then follow me!\nFrom century to century you'll remember me\nIn history - not a mystery or a memory\nGod by nature, mind raised in Asia\nSince you was tricked, I have to raise ya\nFrom the cradle to the grave, but remember\nYou're not a slave\nCause we was put here to be much more than that\nBut we couldn't see it because our mind was trapped\nBut I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains\nRemake the brains, reveal my name\nI guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous\nIt can't be mixed, diluted; it can't be changed or switched\nHere's a lesson if ya guessing and borrowing\nHurry hurry, step right up and keep following\nThe leader\n\n\nA furified freestyle, lyrics of fury\nMy third eye makes me shine like jewelry\nYou're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-maid\nI'll be here when it fade to watch you flip like a renegade\nI can't wait to break and eliminate\nOn every traitor or snake - so stay awake\nand follow and follow, because the tempo's a trail\nThe stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail\nI'm Rakim the Fiend of a Microphone\nI'm not HIM, so leave my mic alone\nSoon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go\nSo fasten your seatbelt, cause I'm about to flow\nNo need to speed slow down to let the leader lead\nWord to daddy, indeed!\nThe R's a rollin stone, so I'm rollin\nDirections is told, then the rhymes are stolen\nStop buggin', a brother said, dig em, I never dug 'em\nHe couldn't follow the leader long enough so I drug 'em\ninto danger zone, he should arrange his own\nFace it, it's basic, erase it, change ya tone\nThere's one R in the alphabet\nIt's a one-letter word and it's about to get\nMore complex from one rhyme to the next\nEric B be easy on the flex\nI've been from state to state, followers tailgate\nKeep comin but you came too late, but I'll wait\nSo back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped\nYou're the next contestant - clap ya hands, you won a trip!\nThe price is right - don't make a deal too soon\nHow many notes could you name this tune?\nFollow the Leader is the title, theme, task\nNow ya know, you don't have to ask\nRap is Rhythm And Poetry, cuts create sound effects\nYou might catch up if you follow the records E. wrecks\nUntil then keep eatin and swallowin\nYou better take a deep breath and keep followin\nThe leader.\n",
