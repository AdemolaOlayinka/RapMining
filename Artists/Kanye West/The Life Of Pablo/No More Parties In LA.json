I wasn't even on a list\nStrippers get invited to where they only get hired\nWhen I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired\nI was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired\nAnd 3 Stacks, man, you preach it to the choir\nAny rumor you heard about me was true and legendary\nI done got Lewinsky and paid secretaries\nFor all my niggas with babies by bitches\nThat use their kids as meal tickets\nNot knowing the disconnect from the father\nThe next generation will be the real victims\nI can't fault 'em really\nI remember Amber told my boy no matter what happens she ain't going back to Philly\nBack to our regularly scheduled programmin'\nOf weak content of slow jammin'\nBut don't worry, this one's so jammin'\nYou know it, L.A., it's so jammin'\nI be thinkin' every day\nMulholland Drive, need to put up some god damn barricades\nI be paranoid every time\nThe pressure, the problem ain't I be drivin'\nThe problem is I be textin'\nMy psychiatrist got kids that I inspired\nFirst song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died\nTextin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive\nThat's why I'd rather take the 405\nI be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim\nBut Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him\nI had my life threatened by best friends who had selfish intents\nWhat I'm supposed to do?\nRide around with a bulletproof car and some tints?\nEvery agent I know know I hate agents\nI'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant\nSomething smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance\nIt's just me, I do it my way, bitch\nSome days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans\nIf I knew y'all made plans I wouldn't have popped the Xans\nI know some fans who thought I wouldn't rap like this again\nBut the writer's block is over, emcees cancel your plans\nI'm 38 years old, a 8 year old with rich nigga problems\nTell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I ain't never drive it\nIt took 6 months to take the Maybach all matted out\nAnd my assistant crashed as soon as they backed it out\nGod damn, got a bald fade, I might slam\nPink fur, got Nori dressing like Cam, thank God for me\nWhole family gettin' money, thank God for E!\nI love rockin' jewelry, a whole neck full\nBitches say he funny and disrespectful\nI feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes\nI feel like Pablo when I see me on the news\nI feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house\nTell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out\nWe need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots\nDrop-dro-dro-dro-drop it like Robocop\nShe brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that\nShe keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that\nShe push me back when the dick go too deep\nThis good dick'll put your ass to sleep\nGet money, money, money, money\nBig, big money, money, money, money\nAnd as far as real friends, tell my cousins I love 'em\nEven the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker\n\nI just keep on lovin' you, baby\nAnd there's no one else I know who can take your place\n\nPlease, no more parties in LA\nPlease, baby, no more parties in LA, uh\nNo more parties in LA\nPlease, baby, no more parties in LA, uh\nNo more parties in LA\nPlease, baby, no more parties in LA, uh\nNo more (Los Angeles)\n\nI'm out here from a very far away place\nAll for a chance to be a star\nNowhere seems to be too far\nSWISH\n",
