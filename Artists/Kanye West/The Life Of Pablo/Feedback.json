Nah, can't make me\nEven if the money low, can't pay me\nEven if the money low, can't play me\nAyy, y'all heard about the good news?\nY'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nWe bout to get this paper\nPablo bought a Roley and a rottweiler\nSeem like the more fame, I only got wilder\nHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us\nHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI\u2019ve been saying how I feel at the wrong time\nMight not come when you want but I'm on time\nAyy, y'all heard about the good news?\nY'all sleeping on me, huh? Had a good snooze?\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nWe 'bout to get this paper\nI can\u2019t let these people play me\nName one genius that ain't crazy\nFollow our father\nYou borrow our motto\nI'm a Chicago south sider\nI'm a Chicago south sider\nAyy, y'all heard about the good news?\nY'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?\nWake up, nigga, wake up\nIt's time to get the paper\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI've been outta my mind a long time\nI know, I know, I shouldn\u2019t even bother\nWith all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers\nFashion show in Gotham, I need another costume\nPETA's mad cause I made a jacket outta possum\nAwesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin\nRich slave in the fabric store picking cotton\nIf Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman\nMan, Jay, they don't really want no problems\nDriving in the same car that they killed Pac in\nDriving in the same uh that they killed Pac in\nHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us\nHands up, hands up, then the cops shot us\nHold on, hold on, hold on\nWait a second, everybody here, I'm the ghetto Oprah\nYou know what that mean? You get a fur! You get a fur!\nYou get a jet! You get a jet! Big booty bitch for you! Woo!\n",
