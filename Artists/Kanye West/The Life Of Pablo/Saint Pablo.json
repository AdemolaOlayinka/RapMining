    "lyrics": "Yeah, 9: 08 L.A. time\nBack in the lab and shit\n\nMy wife said, I can't say no to nobody\nAnd at this rate we gon both die broke\nGot friends that ask me for money knowing I'm in debt\nAnd like my wife said, I still didn't say no\nPeople tryna say I'm going crazy on Twitter\nMy friends best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spending\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretending\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nGrow conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God For Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost Blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n\nAnd you're looking at the church in the night sky\nWondering whether God's gonna say hi\nI've been looking in the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're looking at the church in the night sky\nFather, father, father\nWondering whether God's gonna say hi\nThe night sky, I feel like I'm home, baby\n\nI've been waking the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringing, go and get your kids ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe jews share they truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talking bout how my neck look?\nWell it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buying our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil working hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people, real\nI've been working from enlightened man's dream\nChecking Instagram comments to crowdsource my self esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\nCause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm praying a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rapping\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego and confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know he got a plan, I know I'm on your beams\nOne set of footsteps, you was carrying me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was burying me\nOne set of footsteps, you was carrying me\nWhen I was negotiating with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had the stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\nCause if Jay a billionaire then I'm a never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, looking for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped em at Aldo\nModern day MJ with an off the wall flow\n\nMy life walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm delivering everything I've ever sent to you, bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas\nOh, anywhere, everything but in between\n\nYeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky\nWondering whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're looking in the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're looking in the church in the night sky\nWondering whether God's gonna say hi\n\nPlease face me when I speak\nPlease say to me something before you leave\nYou've been treating me like I'm invisible\nNow I'm visible to you, oh, invisible truths\nThey say I can't quite understand what you say\nUnderstand, understand\nUnderstand I'm standing on the oath\nWith my hand on the book\nTell the truth, nothing but the whole truth\nAnd you always give me half of you, half of you\nTake half a shot, watching all my heart of gold\nMake you feel like something from a film, oh\n",
