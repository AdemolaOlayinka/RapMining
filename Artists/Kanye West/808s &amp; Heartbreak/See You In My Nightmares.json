(Yeah)\n(Yeah)\n\n\nI got the right\nTo put up a fight\nBut not quite\nCause you cut off my light\nBut my sight\nIs better tonight\nAnd I might see you in my nightmare\nOh how'd you'd get there\nCause we were once a fairy tale\nBut this is farewell\n\n\nI got my life\nAnd it's my only one\nI got the night\nI'm running from the sun\nSo good night\nI made it out the door, door, door, door,door\nAfter tonight\nThere will be no return\nAfter tonight\nI'm taking off on the road\nI'm taking off on the road\nAnd letting you know\nLETTING YOU KNOW\n\n\nTell everybody that you know\nThat I don't love you no more\nAnd that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW\nTHAT YOU KNOW\n\n\nOkay I'm back up on my grind\nYou do you and I'm just gon' do mine\nYou do you cause I'm just gon' be fine\nOkay I got you out my mind\nAnd the night is young\nThe drinks is cold\nThe stars is out\nI'm ready to go\nYou always thought I was always wrong\nWell now you know\n\n\nTell everybody, EVERYBODY that you know\nTell everybody that you know\nThat I don't love you no more\nAnd that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW\nTHAT YOU KNOW\n\n\nI got the right\nTo put up a fight\nBut not quite\nCause you cut off my light\nBut my sight\nIs better tonight\nAnd I might see you in my nightmare\nOh how'd you'd get there\nCause we were once a fairy tale\nBut this is farewell\n\nBabygirl I'm finished\nI thought we were committed\nI thought we were cemented\nI really thought we meant it\nBut now we just repent it\nAnd now we just resent it\nThe clouds is in my vision\nLook how high that I be getting\nAnd it's all because of you\nGirl we through\nYou think your shit don't stank\nbut you are Mrs. P-U\nAnd I don't see you\nWith me no more\nNow tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW\nTHAT YOU KNOW\n\n\nTHAT YOU KNOW\nTell everybody that you know\nThat I don't love you no more\nAnd that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW\nTHAT YOU KNOW\n\nL-L-L-L-LETTING YOU KNOW\nTell everybody that you know\nThat I don't love you no more\nAnd that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW\nTHAT YOU KNOW\n",
