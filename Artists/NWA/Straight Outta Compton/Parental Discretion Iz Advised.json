What's goin on?\nAy what ch'all gonna do for this last record?\nNah tell me what cha'all gonna do?\nOkay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!\n\nParental discretion is advised for the moment\nWhile I'm getting candid, now understand it\nAin't too typical in any way, though the pro\non the mic is the D.O. to the C. this is an intro\nI know the DOC makes you want to take a valium\nSo buy a bucket cause upcomin is my album\nAnd for the record, meanin my record, check it\nListen to the single and you'll be like, yo, I gotta get it\nBut in the meantime, listen to the rhyme\nof the Dr. Dre, played wit N.W.A.\nYella's on the drum roll, rockin the beat\nAiyyo Dre, where's you gonna take this shit man?\n\n\nAiyyo, let's take it to the street (WORD UP!)\nLet 'em understand perfection\nLet knowledge be the tool for suckers to stop guessin\nCause I don't give a fuck about a radio play\nObserved the english I display\nLyrics for the adults, children have been barred\nand scarred from listenin to somethin so motherfuckin HARD\nDope, pumpin that's so my shit will never falter\nYo it's Dre so fuck the \"Mind of Minolta\"\nPsycho, like no, other motherfucker\nSo step to me wrong, G-O for what you N-O\nBut be warned, never will I leave like a regular\nCause I'm a little better than the regular competitor\nI use to see 'em on stage\nEarnin money like a thief, but without a guage\nUntil I got full, of clockin the lame gettin pull\n(They said you wasn't gon' get paid)\nNah that's bullshit! They like it stylistic\nAnd I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic\n(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin, when I'm in action\nA photo, or fresh with a flair for fashion\nPure simplicity, see it's elementary\nYou hear one of the hardest motherfuckers this century\nTry to comprise a word to the wise and the guys\nParental discretion is advised\n\n\nRen is most extremely high performance\nThe black hat cause I worn this, cause it's like enormous\nSome shit I don't take it, not even in a toliet\nAnd shit from a sucker, put in a pot and I'll boil it\nTurn up the pilot as it burns\nAnd maybe, the motherfuckers will learn\nI'm not a sub, cause I speak sensible\nNot considered a prince, cause I'm a principal\nI'm engineerin; the shit that you're hearin\nCause when it comes to power, I'm power steerin\nSilly you say, I say you're silly when you say it\nRushin to the eject, to put my shit in and play it\nIt's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur\nAnd I'm not givin a fuck, while I'm damagin ya\nIt's for the record; so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it\nAnd if there was a trophy involved, I'll win it\nPossession is mine and I'm the holder\nCause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck cause I'm older\nSo for you to step off would be wise\nAnd say fuck it, parental discretion is advised\n\n\nI be what is known as a bandit\nYou gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it\nCause if you fail to see, read it in braile\nIt'll still be funky -- so what's next is the flex\nof a genius, my rapid-stutter-steppin if you seen this\ndope, you hope that I don't really mean this\nBut if played, made the grade or high-top fade\nIt's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark\nYou guess it was a test of a different style\nIt's just another motherfucker on the pile\nDrivin your ass with the flow of your tongue\nYou hung yourself short, the after-knowledge was brung\nto your attention, by the hardest motherfuckin artist\nthat is know for lynchin any sucker in a minute\nStagger 'em all\nWhen I start flowin like Niagara Falls\nIce Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle\nMove like a snake when I'm mad; and then my tail rattle\nI get low on the flow so let your kids know\nWhen I bust, parental discretion is a must\n\n\nLittle did they know, that I would be arrivin\nAnd it's surprisin, rockin it from where I been\nBut it's the E here to take, no mistake to be made\nin the trade where funky ass records are bein played\nFuck the regular, yo as I get better the\nbitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick\nSo I get 'em hot, thinkin they're gonna get it\nAs they sit, rubbin their legs like a cricket\nTo you it may be funny, but\nthere's no service of beef, without money\nSo slip the C-note, and you can choke\non a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat\nForeplay; to me ain't shit\nWhen you spread 'em I'm ready, then you can get the dick\nof the Eaze, if you can deal with the size\nBut if you can't, parental discretion's advised!\n\n\n\n\nShut the fuck up!!\n",
