They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks.\nBut nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's.\nBut in the Dayz of Wayback\nI couldn't be laid back,\nBecause I needed ends and I made that.\nI get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and\nStart robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians.\nAnything it took to get paid.\nA nigga like Ren already had the plane made.\nAnd I was in it to win it and not to lose.\nAnd shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse.\nAnd police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em.\nBut not with no money - Yo, I was frayin'em.\nAnd never get caught because nobody is snitch,\nBut one hoe did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch!\nNow she's in a coffin and my life is better off and\n'Cause everybody knows who's the bossin':\nThat black nigga that they call Ren.\nYou fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10.\nSo listen to me as I reminisce the Dayz of Wayback...\nSo check it out y'all...\n\nIt was once a time in the Dayz of Wayback\nWhen niggas was gettin' jacked.\nIn fact it was one I used to pass through up,\nAnd kickin' ass through up.\nMuthafuckin' Compton Massacre...\nNow let me tell you a little something about Compton\nWhen I was a kid and puttin' my bid in.\nYo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm.\nNow it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam.\nEverybody killin', tryin' to make a killin',\nNiggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'.\nWith so many ways to come up\nThe average nigga didn't give a fuck\nAbout another muthafucka in this game and\nClaimin' what he claimin',\nLivin' like he livin',\nKillin' after killin'.\nMurder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man\nWas the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran.\nBut now your best friend is your worst friend.\nGreed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'.\nSo now your shit is stolen\nAnd you and your niggas start rollin'.\nYo, to get your shit back ain't a word of.\nMuff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder.\nThey wanna make you think that it's a crack thang,\nOr a black thang\nOr some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang...\nBut guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan\nA nigga brung up and strung up.\nWhy do I call myself a nigga you ask me?\nRememberin' the days that's past me...\nYo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest.\nThe ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test.\nAnd number one way for you to pass,\nYo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass.\nThey never in the wrong though,\nSo I made a song so\nMuthafuckas had know\nIf, yo, livin situations make you wanna get a gat...\nThat's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...\n",
