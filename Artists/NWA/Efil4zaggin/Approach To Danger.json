Shoot him!)\n\n\nFatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler,\noutrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.\nMurder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,\na dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.\nWith everybody thinking of death I kept working,\nto be one of the last niggaz left.\nSo many people looking for hope, they're broke,\nwithout checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.\nA heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me,\nso figuring to see the D-E-A-D\nbodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary,\nso it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing,\nbut they better take caution, before Dre goes off,\nand starts killing motherfuckers,\njust in order to change the anger for the real nigga,\nwhen I approach to danger\n\nApproach the motherfucking danger,\nCome back to hell and send me some time... (this is it y'all)\n\n\nFinal approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,\nanother dead body and you wanna keep running.\nBut even the rain turns black,\nall you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.\nNo prison, nobody makes bail,\neverybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.\nThink about death, taking your last breath,\nheart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.\nFor so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,\neven though they wanna make a crime.\nYo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,\nbecause it will release the fucking police.\nFuck 'em, I approach to danger,\ncause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.\nSo you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,\ncause in the long run... (we'll all die)\n",
