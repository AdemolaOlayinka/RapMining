Do you remember me? (I said no)\nHuhu yes you do suga\nMy name is Bertha but you can call me booga\nRemember the time when you were drunk at a party\nWe was slow dancin, give ya all this body\n\n\nWhen she said that she loved me, I was in shock\nOh my God got a fat girl on my jock\n\n\n(I got a fat girl on my jock) (Fat girl) (Got a fat girl on my jock)\n\nShe gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown\nand with a bare hug picked me off tha ground\nSqueezion me tight, atttempted to bug me\nGrabbed me by tha rear, said (Love me, hug me!)\nI was hell, victim of a scandal\ncoz this girl's too much for E to handle\nBroke tha bee's grip, started to run\nBack to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun\nShe's grubbin, thighs rubbin in a hot pursuit\nI loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot\nShe kept on comin because of addiction\nLegs on fire because of friction\nMy gun broke, now I was doomed\nDropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon\nAs I swung, tha fat girl fell\nLyin on tha ave just like a beach whale\nThat's tha story, it's quite ill\nand all fat girls y'all besta chill\nAll overweight freaks stay off my block\nCause it's eerie to have a fat girl on your jock\n",
