Niggas be bucking\nWhy you never bucking, where you be at man?\nAll of a sudden you the motherfuckin Neo Brown of the fucking hood\nIts disgusting man, stay out the magazines\nKeep my name out your motherfucking mouth\nTheres no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding\nThat means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay\nNiggas been hating me since I been nine, shining\nwith suede motherfucking balles on in silks\nI'ma always be the young don, dont be like the niggas on the other side\nHating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge\nYou niggas come up and get this money and move on baby\nQ.B.\n",
