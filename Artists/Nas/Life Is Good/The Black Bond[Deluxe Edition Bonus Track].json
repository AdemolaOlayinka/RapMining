I'm a fuckin' juggernaut\nNever sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up\nWho don't speak, she quiet\nSo I can think, conspire\nOn my feet's , and sometimes sneakers\nWear ties at the Setai Miami time-pieces\nAre from Zurich. It's like I'm allergic\nTo non-oxidolic nine\nGive it to you raw so you can feel it\n",
