    "lyrics": "The ill reminisce and think about the fly days\nNothing like them 80s summer N.Y. days\nHop on the NB5 days\nMopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways\nHow it all started, fifth floor apartment\nA jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects\nA kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners\nNow chill in resorts, enjoying massages\nCheck out the oracle bred from city housing\nNas, I'll rise the deads by thousands\nI remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi\nHollis Ave, Run and them but I proudly\nPut a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid\nYou love to hear the story how it started\nThe bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet\nBefore there was a audience to watch us\nI assure you, there was a process\n\n\"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started\"\nHow it all got started, yeah\n\"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started\"\nHow it, how it all got started\n\"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started\"\nHear the story, started off\nStarted off, started off\nHow it all got started\n\"Back when, back when, back when, back when\nBack when, back when, back when, back when\"\n\nTo call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct\nPac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink\nAt other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way\nWon't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates\nLet alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow\nIt was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke\nNas, my real name, stage name, same thing\nHow could you let these lames claim king? I'm so ashamed, man\nI light a L for Vernon, for niggas who would burn in Hell\nFor Vernon; 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street\nPimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials\nOf the ghetto queens, kings, stories true\nWho possesses the testicular fortitude\nTo blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you\nYou blame your own shortcomings on sex and race\nThe mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews\nIt's hogwash point of views, stereotypical\nAnti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed\nAnd it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve\nThat's why I hate doing interviews\nBut I don't sweat it, study long, study raw\nMy man Dion said \"Nas over-think the songs he writing\"\nI'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man\nI got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten\n\n\"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started\"\nHow it all got started, yeah\n\"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started\"\nHow it, how it all got started\n\"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started\"\nHear the story, started off\nStarted off, started off\nHow it all got started\n\"Back when, back when, back when, back when\nBack when, back when, back when, back when\"\n",
