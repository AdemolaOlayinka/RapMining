My gun off safety\nSince a Tunnel escape key, my jewelry in HD\nSilent rage, pristine in my vintage shades\nI\u2019m not in the winters of my life or the beginner stage, I am the dragon\nMaserati, pumpin\u2019 Biggie, the great legend\nBlastin\u2019, I\u2019m after the actress who played Faith Evans\nMy little Jackie Onassis, dig?\nI\u2019m so high, I never land like Mike Jackson\u2019s crib\nBest on .45, still crack ya rib sacrilege\nWhen lids talk trash about the nasty kid\nPast nasty now, I\u2019m gross and repulsive\nTalk money, is you jokin\u2019? Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa\nIn the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket\nOn the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch\nI got all you envy, but don\u2019t offend\nI\u2019m skinny, but still I\u2019m too big for a Bentley\nYou are your car, what could represent?\nToo Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly\nMust design me somethin\u2019 Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the \u201990s\nDrug dealer call, rush to the bar\nMove, niggas, we don\u2019t give a fuck who you are\nBlack card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims\nPretty women see them them saggin\u2019\nBet a hundred stacks, niggas\u2019ll run it back\nJust havin\u2019 fun, I ain\u2019t even begun to black\nLight another blunt in fact\n(Nasty)\nNasty kid\n(Nasty)\nYeah\n(Nasty)\nThe kid!\n(Nasty)\nNasty kid\nFor the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it\nGot a bunch of niggas in prison braggin\u2019, sayin\u2019 \u201cIt was Nas I used to hustle wit\u2019\u201d\nI display fashions while my lungs engage hashes, guns on my waist past his\nSince I\u2019m cakin\u2019 up, put funds in my safe, laughin\u2019\nAnd joining the niggas passin\u2019 you niggas was straight assin\u2019\nExcuse the vulgarity, I\u2019m still not fully adjusted\nOr used to the new fans hearin\u2019 me spit rapidly\nI never see the whips niggas be claimin\u2019 they drivin\u2019\nI guess entertainment means blatantly lyin\u2019\nFake it \u2019til you make it, I\u2019ve driven those toys\nBeen in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin\u2019 in doors\nFor my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor\nI\u2019m no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher\nFor my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga\n",
