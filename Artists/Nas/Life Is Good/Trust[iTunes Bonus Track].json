    "lyrics": "It's like a cold story repeated over and over\nIn the winters of my mind\nThis shit be real, man\nShit's crazy out here\nYo yo, yo what up y'all?\nThat's my niggas over there. Word\n\nIf you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers\nI could tell the future of a dude how his stance is\nWonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is\nIs he gonna cock it and pop it? His waistband big\nBut he don't have that thing in him, slangin' just ain't in him\nBody language is off, he's soft\nBut soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'\nCause you fell away; my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway\nOne look could tell me if you really came to kill me\nBe the quiet nigga lookin', layin' with the milli\nWho dat over there, creepin'? Who homie by the tree?\nBetter safe than sorry, look at p-noid me\nFew machine guns close, we could squeeze all three\nBe a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me\nIt's a lesson every premonition\nLotta niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention.\nListen\n\nI want a bitch I can trust\nSome niggas I can trust\nAccountants lookin' over my figures I can trust\nA lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust\nDamn my nigga trust, I can never get enough\nA Ruger I can trust, shooters I can trust\nGoons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust\nAnd if I can't trust you, the fuck is you here for?\nSome of you niggas' true colors becoming clear more\n\nIt's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war\nThis is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off\nI see ya moms she still speak,\nShe don't know I ain't cool wit her son no more\nIt's old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge\nTakes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs\nWe buried our dead, been years\nWhy should I worry 'bout him\nConstantly watchin' my back\nPlus niggas tellin' I dread\nAnother day I put a family in black\nThough I be calm and relaxed\nThough I know somehow it will come back\nEven if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life\nWhat was it worth to see you covered in dirt?\nIt's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted\nMother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide\nJust tattoos of my niggas' names. I wonder will it change?\nLet's ride\n\n\nIt's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position\nA caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions\nFrom the mind of a man who went at it with killers\nSit down little man, let me school you in hood business\nSeen a lotta niggas blow, lotta dreams folded\nSome wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated\nAin't too much left to buy, bought it I'm loaded I guess\nLear jets - I ask myself do I need love or success?\nThey say the artist that truly suffer his stuff is the best\n'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve, pain pistols and sex\nRemember spraypaintin' the word \"Fresh\" and then staring at it\nOlder folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it\nBuildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the Maclaren past it\nSame old man from years ago told me life is short\nSo from infant to geriatric, trust ya own judgment.\nLive with it and love it\n",
