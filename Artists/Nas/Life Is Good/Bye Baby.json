    "lyrics": "I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\nBye baby, I guess you know why I walked away\nWhen we walked to the altar that was an awesome day\nDid counselling, couldn't force me to stay\nSomething happens when you say I do, we go astray\nWhy do we mess it up, we was friends we had it all\nReason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault\nHe in the grave, let it go, he no longer living\nSaid you caught him cheating with mom and other women\nFuck that gotta do with us\nHere's the keys to the newest truck\nBirkin bags, we burnin' cash, now baby do it up\nNo matter who you fuck, that was before me\nWanted you as my shawty since I saw you screamin'\n\"Hate you so much right now\"\nShould've saw the man in angry black women\nAshes of a demon, I'm leaving\n\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)\nYou know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)\nCause I'm sayin' bye-bye (Bye baby)\nCause I'm sayin' bye-bye\nI guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby\n\nBye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave\nSeven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed\nLet's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years\nYou and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird\nSame time, different year, I was diggin' ya flow\nThen I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know\nI thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches\nI was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin\nYet, the cuter version, yet I knew you personally\nBetter than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain\nCrib in the Dominican you got away from everybody\nYou screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably\nThe highlight of my life, like \"Hi yo look at my wife\"\nGangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night\nBailed you out, next morning we got clean\nLike it never happened and later we at that Heat game\nJust another day in the life of two people in love\nBut it wasn't enough, so baby guess what\n\n\nListen, could you imagine writing your deposition?\nDivorce Lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?\nWith you paying out the ass, and I'm talking half\nNot some but half. No serious, half\nHalf of your soul, half of your heart you leaving behind\nIt's either that or die, I wanted peace of mind\nAnd all I seen was selfish cowards, under they breath\nSaying \"why did Nas trust her? \", but look at yourself, speak louder bruh\nYou live with your babymoms and scared to make an honest woman out of her\nAnd make her your bride, fake bitch you ain't even a lie\nAt least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride\nPlus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride\nHe got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes\nNext go round I hope I pick the truest type and watch me do it all again\nIt's a beautiful life, aight\nGoodbye\n",
