    "lyrics": "Yeah\nI want all my niggas to come journey with me\nMy name is Nas, and the year is 1973\nBeginning of me, therefore I could see\nThrough my belly button window who I am...\n\nI existed in a womb, just like an abyss\nCame straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist\nPunching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix\nTwitching cause I'm nervous\nThought my intended purpose\nWas to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain\nBut to take on a name, my pops chose for me\nBloodstream full of indo\nDeveloping eyes looking out my belly button window\nMy father's face wears a frown\nAnd I'm wondering if they even want me around\nCause I'll go back to spirit town\nSo I could rest longer before I come back down\nThe chute again, in the near future when\nMy moms and pops can agree on this\nWas here before but my moms saw her gynocologist\nHe dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont\nYou got a 120 days do what you want\nBut as for me coming back this be my last time\nAbort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind\n\n\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\n\nI shot my way out my mom dukes\n\nThey must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive\nGuess I got what you call an ill-will to survive\nWhen I look hard the lights is killing my eyes\nI know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live\nMove side to side hear loud music and vibe\nAll black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie\nSolar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube\nI'm covered in this thick layer of goo\nMonth two was the least most comfortable\nMy umbilical cord choking me\nBut month 3 was closer, see\nThats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic\nBut I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute\nWatching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well\nFeared fist fights, so terrified when we fell\nWhile they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall\nI wondered if I am born will I be safe at all\nThis place they call the world though my view was so large\nCouldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge\nMonth 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July\nBut the Lord already figured out a date and time\nSeptemeber 14th, 73\nGet ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me\nArms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop\nSee how the goverment will start re-training cops\nMonth 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced\nPops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too\nSaid stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on\nSurgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out\nEverything blurry, my first breath screams out\nTears pouring down my pops face he's so proud\nWanted to hold me, but I was so bloody\nThey washed me off and he said \"At least that nigga aint ugly!\"\nPlaced me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother\nFinally, I got to see who held me in her body\nShe loved me,and I plan to over through the devil\nY'all bout to see this world in trouble\nMotherfuckers...\n",
