    "lyrics": "Uhh\n\n\nPushin drop-tops, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes\nYoungest gorillas up to bat at home plate\nThat was a uncanny era, guns in my pants\nYeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade\nHomicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball\nThat's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause\nCause Ray Charles could see the ghetto\nWas told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil\nCause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats\nWatchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets\nThe car show, 560's, chemical afros\nAcuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova\nLive chicks be, asses bustin out of they clothes\nWearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes\nSo where them years go? Where the old gold beers and cheers go?\nBut now them shorties here doe, so\n\n\nThe doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs\nRiker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?\nThe drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb\nAnd I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time\nThe doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs\nRiker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?\nThe drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb\nAnd I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?\n\n\nPolitical thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers\nin army boots, yellin \"Join the armed forces!\"\nWe lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons\nNeedles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes\nThere's still a lot of nigger callin in the coorporate offices\nWar in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us\nThey won't be servin the beast too long\nThe murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn\nBeat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose\nAnd Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose\nin frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children\nwith fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers\nWe devil incarnates, headed for jail\nWhere Shell gas company in South Africa be havin us killed\nYour paper money was the death of Christ\nAnd all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life\nIt's like a cycle\n\n\n\n\nNiggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up\nThat's when we were lied to, buyin hair products\nBack before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin\n'til awareness started penetratin\nThe styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin liquor\njust to prove we some creative niggaz\nTurnin nothin into somethin, is God work\nAnd you get nothin without struggle and hard work\nWar is necessary to my niggaz in chains\nFrom Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing\nThe hardest thing is to forgive, but God does\nEven if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves\nTake one step toward him, he takes two toward you\nEven when all else fail, God support you\nI done it, got God Son on my stomach\nMy heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin blunted\nDo your body right and it loves you back\nYou only get one life, and yo because of that\nI'm still blazin, goin out for the cause\nStill rockin stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws\nAnd it's like that\n",
