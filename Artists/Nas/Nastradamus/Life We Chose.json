Yo these streets don't allow you to blink\nYou get showered by lead, comin out with your mink\nBow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles\nDump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico\nIt's hard fuckin with niggaz you hope you can trust\nYou a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck\nAnd you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?\nShit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck\n\n\n\n\nUhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?\nHe wanna stick you\nWhat's love, you got beef?\nNobody rollin wit you\nWhat's love, you locked up, and your family don't care\nIs love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?\nWhat's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe\nAnd you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'\nWhat's real, when you talk behind a man's back\nthen you see him and give him dap, now explain that?\nWhat's trust, when they seperate your case\nWhen you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face\nWhat's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?\nAnd he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?\nWhat's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?\nThey blaze purple haze with em the next day?\nGod forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire\nWon't hesitate, I'ma spray fire\nBut everybody's different, you won't know how you react\ntil you in that position, and that's an actual fact\nThe hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?\nYou was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you\nWho's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90\nOn your deathbed you regret bein grimy\nWhat's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?\nA ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?\nThen what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse\nwhen he come home to catch another case?\nLife's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it\nYou did it, heaven or hell or prison\nWho knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up\nSave up before it's over neighbor, I told ya\nYou gettin older player, look at those who gave up\n",
