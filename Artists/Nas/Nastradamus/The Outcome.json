    "lyrics": "Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves\nGave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water\nMy skin layered in diamonds and sage\nLeft alone and confused, forces enslaved by days\nTime keeps on whorin us\nGhetto saviors can't keep ignorin us\nFlowers and flames, flutes from her fingers\nRifles pointed from her sac\nor was it simply a bag of sticks and stones\nEither way, she wore a compass on her head\nRains don't stop the grass from turnin red\nHer hair was half perm, half dread\nWe gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance\nArms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life\nA new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice\nSymbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run\nTime travelling was late\nWatching was a blind man's mistake\nAll his assets melted right in front of his face\nHis right leg drabbed with demon paste\nShoes stayed angel laced\nNever count your blessings with haste\nEven a prophet can catch a case\nDidn't realize how sweet the future might taste\nTelepathically cutting through mental gates\nWords were weapons against their hate\nShepherds search for stars in her hair\nHer chest grew fermented like yeast\nShe broke her body like aged bread\nHe gave her truth from all the books he'd read\nShe wrote her poems inside the mud\nSacrificed her cervix to fix the future\nNamed their boys and spit truth inside his mouth\nRead warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly\nResurrected from bones and dirt\nShe made hard niggaz smile\nLeft her seeds inside the Earth\nGave hustlers and killers life's worth\nThis is the life we chose, remember who was here first\nFind a reason why you curse\nGold rushed tongues by dreams too loose\nSporting electronic nooses\nHoeing humanity love-ticks over lust\nDespite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me\nIn God We Still Trust\n",
