    "lyrics": "Some of us have angels -- the kingdom, the power\nSome of us have angels -- the power, the glory\nSome of us have demons -- greed, and lust\nSome of us have demons -- lust, temptation\n\n\nNow this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat\nA good nigga, you don't leave tracks\nA hood nigga wantin G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that\nYou feel you need that, where the jooks at?\nThese are your niggaz, creepin they be leavin niggaz sleep witchu\nLoc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official\nSometime they grimy, speakin on they own people\nThey snake you if they have to, raised tattoos\nNow these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens\nAll the homies stick em, you think you own em man listen\nShe stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen\nPut a root on you, next week they find you missin\nDead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and\ntumbled til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up\nFake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices\nTwo sides of us, negative or positive\n\n\n\n\nNow this is your mom, your good luck charm\nPushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long\nNobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy\nIn and out of jail, mom's screamin, \"God take me!\"\nThis is your pop, chip off the old block that made him\nThe man of the house, mom and pops seperatin\nSpittin image of a gangster the way pop walked\nthe way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now\nThis is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies\nTurnin into the things moms wanted you not to be\nCrime followin the wrong dudes who have no values\nLife's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you\nThis is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of\nniggaz around you make threats\nThey tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament\nEven though your decision won't help you benefit\n\n\n\n\nNow once again this is you, entertainin your desires\nBitches money and guns, aimin and you fire\nEveryday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed\nTryin to eat? You form material needs\nThe weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off\nby stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off\nHis reputation is, bigger than his whole life span\nHe never planned to fail, he just failed to plan\nWhat does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers\nAnd any chance he get, he can take niggaz\nHe comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is\nwhen he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me\nYou are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head\nAnd if I let go I'm dead\nHe stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit\nAnd now the body experience, so now I feel it\nLookin at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me\nThem court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary\nI never hate, that's just wasted energy\nThe past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?\nThe future - and time only reveals, what fear is\nFalse expectations, appearin real\nWe only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told\nand I will til permanently, my eyes are closed\n",
