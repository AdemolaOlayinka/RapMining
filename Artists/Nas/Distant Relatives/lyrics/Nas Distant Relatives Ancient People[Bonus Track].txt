Like a bird, in the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the sun
Melody
Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quake
Space and sea
This is rock and roll meets aristotle
I fly those g5's through the skies to cabbo
Martial arts more ancient than tabbo
Schwartzman, more ancient than zorro
Ancient like the pharohs or priests of yoruba
Maher rabah-nasr is the best
Them paths like climbing mount kiliminjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camoflage
Chief before sarge, our lieutenant
Village elders before senates
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the tech cendent
There was moons before months, and time before minutes

From love, onto language, onto heiroglyphist
De Invention of the wheel, onto mathematics
De almanac, de calender, onto geographics
Herbal medicine, to anti-biotic Ginseng to acetonic
Water pump, water pump, to onto hydrolics
Moonlight, candle light, onto electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college

Junior Reid:
Man ah Buss de earth, man ah Buss de sky
Junior Gong, and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man ah trod de gravel, it dutty and it dry
Oh oi, dem nuh see nuh wings, but man ah fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem nuh know what life is worth
Oh Oi, tell dem stop polluting mother earth
Man ah mek ah trot, me robe, me sandles and me rod
Dem shouldve known, hear seh man this man ah God
