Tuck your chain, we're due coming\nRenegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds\nBet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it\nEither move on or move on it\n\nQueens to Kingston\nGunshot we use and govern the kingdom\nRise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes\nRealize you can die any instant\n\nAnd I can hear the sound of a voice\nWhen you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen\n\nSnitching, I can see him pissing on hisself\nAnd he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it\n\nSwitching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly\nCome around and be persistent\n\nThat's how you end up in a hitlist\n\nAin't no bad man business\n\nNo evidence\n\nCrime scene, fingerprint-less\n\nFlow effortless\n\nCasual like the weekends\n\nNo pressure when\n\nWe're comfy and decent\n\nWe set this off beasting\n\nHunting season\n\nAnd, frankly speaking...\nWord is out, hysteria you heard about\nNas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out\nBody the verse until they scream \"murder\" out\nThe kings is back, time to return the crown\nWho want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming\nRenegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds\nBet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it\nEither move on or move on it\nWord is out, hysteria you heard about\nNas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out\nBody the verse until they scream \"murder\" out\nThe kings is back, time to return the crown\nWho want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming\nRenegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds\nBet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it\nEither move on or move on it\n",
