Will you follow?\nImprove your values\nEducation is real power\nI reach em like Bono\nSo get rid of your self sorrow\nAdd some bravado\nGet wealthy likes Wells Fargo\nIts truth, that I am you\nAnd I am proof\nSurviving through\nWe do what we gotta do\nYo we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you\nThen maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school\nCause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave\nThis generation is destined to do historic deeds.\n\n\nuhh if you weather that storm\nThen that rain bring sun\nBeen a long time comin\nI know change gone come\nMan I gotta keep it movin to the beat of my drum\nLast night I set the future at the feet of my son\nBut they thinkin that my generation gotta die young\nIf we all come together then they cant divide one\nDon't worry bout it just be about it\nGot a message from god heaven too crowded\nBut I say hey young world you've never looked betta\nAnd I heard change started with man in the mirror ughh\nThis generation\nI'mma represent\nA generation led by a black president\nNow hows that for change\nWho knew that could change\nI don't even look at the flag the same hey ughhh\nSo when you finish readin revelations\nThank god for my generation\n",
