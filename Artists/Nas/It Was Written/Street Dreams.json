Gettin put on to crack money\nWith all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry\nA case of beers in the staircase I wasted years\nSome niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career\nBut I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt\nWith Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out\n",
