If you're arrested and hung\nWhere niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue\nIt's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer\nthe violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia.\nThe cognac plurger plus the trees,\nbut whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze,\nand got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.\nUsed to be a general but just lost his stripe\nPipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers\nAstoria walls with cypress, since I got a problem with the law-writers,\nI kick some more items just to explore horizons,\nthe palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,\nthe crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay\n\n\n\nThey say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast,\na lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas\nWas it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz\nFuck what they teach in class I'ma reach the mass\nStrap up, no back up, it's jungle tactics\nLivin' practice, out of line niggas get smacked backwards\nSo wear it if the cap fits, fold it up money and mad clips\nA stack right under my matress\nTo smoke a nigga like a Hugh Bros. motion picture\nNiggas gettin' open cruise, won't be olding niggas\nApril fools they laugh the jokes on the benches\nCease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence\n\n\nSilent\nSilent, silent\nMurder\n\nMy right handers never play too close to cameras\nIt's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers\nPeace-making niggas pep talk\nthe peace-makin 'niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew.\nTime to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains\nNiggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage\nLocked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up\nWhat's the flavour when your neighbors do jake favours?\nLock them real niggas down and lettin fake players\nroam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute,\nthe weak can object the right composite\nWe're plottin' all murderous schemes,\nit seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of queens\nthe palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'ma play\nthe crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay\n\n\n\nAnd Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's\noffering and not his.\nAbel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God,\nand Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -\ndrove him to murder\n",
