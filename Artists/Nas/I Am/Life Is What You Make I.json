(what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)\nNot long ago you was the man on some hot shit\nSo just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this\nMake sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)\n\n\n\n\nMake history before you go\nFuck the misery, you po we gettin doe\nExcept the ?dollars? other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)\nTime is viable\nLow and behold the young, black, and powerful\nGot to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow\nYou wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow\nPayin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried\nThat's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit\nGotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)\nIf you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish\nDeals made by God and the Devil, and we in it\nPawns in the game, can't complain or say shit\nJust strap up and hold on, hope for the best\nprepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth\nNo tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first\nNor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga\n",
