    "lyrics": "Uh..\nPacino life, G a roll, casino dice\nat the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights\nGamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars\nFlashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards\nSpent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd\ncause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob\nI never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five\ncause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride\nFlyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin\nTellin my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin\nFlew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin\nto the concrete jungle of cement\nLimousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin\nTold my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when\ngot to my crib, where the hell my keys went?\nRingin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure\nDropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door\nSlow music, H-Town, no that's down low\nMy baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo\nto the back, she must be inside and can't hear\nProbably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair\nI walked in through the back door entrance\nShocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense\nchased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses\nand lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas\nA pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands\nSomethin swingin on the ceilin fan, I stopped it\nSwingin slower and slower..\nOn the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin\nThought about my nine-side Glock but somethin made me disregard it\nStarted my way up to where the noise and music was at\nFroze, I couldn't react\nBedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga\nmumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass\nand she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses\nCherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit\nSearchin for words I found none, without a sound\nI left the house with a sick smile and took my gun\nNow I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?\nCall my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin through\n\n\nI thought you loved me\nI thought you cared for me\nI thought you needed me\nDid you believe in me?\n\n\nGot up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost\nI ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off\n\"Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?\"\nI said, \"Nah,\" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip\nHopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play\nTo the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway\nI said, \"Bet you'll never guess in a million years\nwhat I just saw happenin -- and probably still is\nSnuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin my wiz\nI saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid\nI'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me\"\nJust when I thought I found love, she shitted on me\nShopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement\n20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with\nMy surprise couldn't match the one she had for me\nWe pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly\nParked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us\nRan to the side of my house, cocked the heater\nWalked to the front when I talked he had junk\nBitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot\nShot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in\nGrabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend\nOne between the eye, she's died, by mistake\nMust've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face\nHeard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies\nHeard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes\nWe surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?\nCame out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide\nHorse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love\nCocked the strap, then he ran out the back\nMad shots couldn't tell what was goin on\nSat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms\nPulled her ring out my pocket I was savin\nPut it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin\nto Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial\nthrough you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin\nI never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed\nthis'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene\nOn that note, same time, the cops busted in\nKissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said \"Amen\"\nPut the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close\nSqueeze the toast, said to her, \"Now unto God, we elope\"\n\n.. we elope ..\n",
