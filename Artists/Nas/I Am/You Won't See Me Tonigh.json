Cause it can't be fake\nThis ain't no game (C'mon)\nYou gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)\ncause it's real out here (uh-huh)\nSo make up your mind, cause I ain't got no time\nY'know? (C'mon)\n\n\nI'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama\nWe toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me\nI won't stress you but bless you\nMentally and sexual, we both intellectual\nCan't forget how I met you;\nyou thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim\nbut I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens\nAnd when I gotcha - you ridin with me\nYou keep askin, \"When do you have time for me?\"\nI'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented\nLifestyle expensive, attract women\nYou wanna search my pockets, and act all wild\nSay I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?\nWanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me\nCheck my car for rubbers, but quit tryin\nbefore you find what you lookin for and get to cryin\nYou always sayin what you gon' do if you catch me lyin\n\n\n\nYou won't see me tonight {Yeah right} (Say what? Say what?)\nYou won't see me tomorrow {uh-huh} (uh-huh)\nI'll be gone by daylight {Doubt that} (What?)\nAnd you'll be so full of sorrow {Yeah right}\nYou'll go tell all your friends {That's right} (Say what?)\nhow you called and I follow {They know it}\nBut you won't see me tonight {You don't believe that}\nNo you won't see me tomorrow\n\n\nCaramel kisses of Jezebel's sister\nI feel no guilt when I twist ya\nTurn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha\nYou got your name on his lease, copy his key\nThat's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice\nGo 'head and live baby, I know you his lady\nYou page me, when you got the day free\nbut I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps\nYou wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites\nlike I'll massage you while you massage me, mami\nBut can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?\nSpeak up, I wanna know if you can keep up\nTimberland boots for girls, with the tree stump\nBaggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them\nThey for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely\nbut I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby\n\n\n\nCall you on a Monday\nI'll call you back baby\nCall you on a Tuesday\nMy cell is off baby\nCall you on a Wednesday\nI'm out of town baby\nYou won't be back til Thursday\nI'll page you back baby\nCall you on a Monday\nI'll call you back baby\nCall you on a Tuesday\nI'm out of town baby\nCall you on a Wednesday\nMy cell is off baby\nYou won't be back til Thursday\nI'll call you back baby\n\n\n\nYou won't see me tonight (Say what?)\nYou won't see me tomorrow (Say what?)\nI'll be gone by daylight\nAnd you'll be so full of sorrow\nYou'll go tell all your friends (What what?)\nhow you called and I follow (Say what?)\nBut you won't see me tonight\nNo you won't see me tomorrow\n\n\nThinking of me you gettin the chills\nLike a rush through your body when you think how it feels\nGive me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy\nTell your friends you in love with Nas not his money\nAnd I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs\nIceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires\nYou make a good wife to most men\nI know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend\nGet it baby?\n\n\n\nYou won't see me tonight (uh-huh)\nYou won't see me tomorrow (Say what?)\nI'll be gone by daylight {Dayyyy-light}\nAnd you'll be so full of sorrow {.. Word?}\nYou'll go tell all your friends {Tell your friends what?} (Say what?)\nhow you called and I follow {Uhh, uhh}\nBut you won't see me tonight {Not tonight baby}\nNo you won't see me tomorrow\n\n\nThe God, The God, The God, Nasir (You won't see me tonight)\nThe Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (You won't see me tomorrow)\nNah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)\n(And you'll be so full of sorrow)\nUhh uhh (You'll go tell all your friends)\nTell your friends (how you called and I followed)\nHow you followed me (But you won't see me tonight)\nNot tonight baby (No you won't see me tomorrow)\nC'mon, c'mon c'mon\nTomorrow, what?\nDaylight, ghost\n\n\nSay what, say what? Yo (You won't see me tonight)\nYou won't see Timbaland tonight baby\nOhhh, or Nas Esco', check it\nLet it ride\nLet it ride\n",
