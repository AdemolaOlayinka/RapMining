(\"It's a.. small world..\")\n\nSnook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home\nfrom Attica known, for keeping chrome calibers\nSmooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it\nFive years planning to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks\nHad a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low\nPlayed the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.\nStarted robbin niggaz til he caught a whole kilo\nHe had a bunch of starving niggaz he owe, he never paid though\nGot large, sign on his door, \"Don't knock hard\"\nLaying with his bitch, niggaz is rich, is what he told her\nPlayed the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller\nHere come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over\nA year went past, Snook went flossing fast\nHis old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash\n\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga reap what you sew\nWhat goes around, comes around\nIf you sleep you don't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nwhere beef could never end\nAt the time you least expect it\nI'm gonna see you again nigga\nIt's a small world, no doubt (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nYou get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you\nSomeway, somehow\nIt's a small world\nWatch what you do.. (\"It's a.. small world..\")\n\nI seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why\nwe let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull\nAnother thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite\nblack hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast\nSnook was one of em, so many more\nEven that Fendi whore, got niggaz hit up yeah let that Henny pour\nCarolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich\nHeard her bodyguard took Snook to God\nCarolyn when she needed him, he took the job\nHe was close to her, ever since she took him inside\nWhen his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five\nHe went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive\nHe was live - do niggaz even know the things that he tried\nRobbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died\nHe stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)\nHe staring at me hard\nTwo of his mans with him, I got to hit em\nI'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on\nAt the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing\nout the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip\nHit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play\nIt's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies\nbut can't figure out whose who, keep it true\nShit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never\nCause everyday is on, Levin this life, out for this cheddar\n\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nNigga you reap what you sew\nWhat goes around, comes around\nIf you sleep you won't know\nA very small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nwhere beef, never ends\nAt the time you least expect it\nI'm gonna see you again\nIt's a small world (\"It's a.. small world..\")\nYou get away with it now\nSoon enough it catches up to you\nSomeway, somehow\nIt's a small world\nWatch what you do..
