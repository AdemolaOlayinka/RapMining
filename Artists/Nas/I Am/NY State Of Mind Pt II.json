It might've saved later from my block\nN.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin\nstitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin\nBut who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans\nParked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?\nHustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog\nto my building -- come out later wearin camouflage\nSee the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men\nNiggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare\nwith dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet\nSimple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews\nOvercrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant\nfather's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested\nHad eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven\nSeven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven\nSix of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick\nThe sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick\nwhen he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin\nFour niggaz still hangin, years passed and slang changin\nThree of us now, fourth nigga ain't around\nWe all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit\nFake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth\ncould've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown\nAll I got left in the end is two of my best friends\nAnd we all goin out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?\n\nNew York, New York (\"New York state of mind\" -> )\nNew York, New York (\"New York state of mind\" -> )\n\n\nYou heard about it, you see about it\nYou read about it, it's in your papers\nIt's in your daily news (\"Get money!\")\nNew York chronicles, every day\nThe crime rate, the murder rate\nThe money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?\nNew York state of mind baby, check it out\n\n\nI'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot\nNew York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot\nI take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox\nYou lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox\nHear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along\nAll the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue\nYoung thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations\nBitches and niggaz both on parole or probation\nShit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues\nI got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead\nCause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit\nStick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks\nBunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz\nLift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you\nSome of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years\nBe the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers\nThat ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears\nYour name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid\nFaggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids\nFuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live\nGot your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South\ncomin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths\nAll of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s\nrunnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score\nbut it's hard to get the shit off\nNiggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off\nWhen the fiend come around the block, happy as hell\nNiggaz, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale\nCutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors\nGo to any hood that's live and make it liver\nA lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin\nBut I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin\n\nNew York, New York\nNew York, New York\n",
