It's like the game ain't the same\nGot younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name\nand claim some corners, crews without guns are goners\nIn broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us\nFo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact\nSame niggaz'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black\nThere was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked\nSo hold your stash until the coke price drop\nI know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock\nAnd if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo\nYou gotta slide on a vacation\nInside information keeps large niggaz erasin and they wives basin\nIt drops deep as it does in my breath\nI never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death\nBeyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined\nI think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind\n\"New York state of mine\" -\n\nBe havin dreams that I'ma gangster -- drinkin Moets, holdin Tecs\nMakin sure the cash came correct then I stepped\nInvestments in stocks, sewein up the blocks\nto sell rocks, winnin gunfights with mega cops\nBut just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger\nMake enough figures until my pockets get bigger\nI ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin\nGive me a Smith and Wessun I'll have niggaz undressin\nThinkin of cash flow, buddah and shelter\nWhenever frustrated I'ma hijack Delta\nIn the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays\nYoung bitches is grazed each block is like a maze\nfull of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed\nFrom what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black\nI'm livin where the nights is jet black\nThe fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back\nand lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn\nOr the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes\nI got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane\nLife is parallel to Hell but I must maintain\nand be prosperous, though we live dangerous\ncops could just arrest me, blamin us, we're held like hostages\nIt's only right that I was born to use mics\nand the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice\nI'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow\nMy rhymin is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule\nThe smooth criminal on beat breaks\nNever put me in your box if your shit eats tapes\nThe city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps\nThat's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks\nI'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of buddah and bitches with beepers\nIn the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya\nInhale deep like the words of my breath\nI never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death\nI lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times\nNothing's equivalent, to the new york state of mind\n\"New York state of mind\" -\n\"Nasty Nas\" -\n",
