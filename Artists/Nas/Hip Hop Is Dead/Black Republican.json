(What's up homey)\nI mean.. it's what you expected ain't it?\nLet's go... uh, uh, uh, uh, uh\nTurn the music up and the headphones\nuh, Yea, that's perfect (Yea, right)\nUh, we got to take and make a nigga wait on this motherfucker\n(ha ha!) Make niggas mad and shit like..\nNiggas usually start rappin' after 4-bars, nigga go in\nStart dancin' in this motherfucker\nYea, (Yea) niggas come outta nowhere\n\n\nI feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in\nCan't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em\nProbably in the back of the hood, I'm like \"Fuck it then\"\n\n\nHuddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then (What?)\nThough you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend\nWe had governin', who would of thought the love would end\nLike ice cold album, all good things\nNeva thought we sing the same song that all hood sang\nThought it was all wood-grain, all good brain\nYou wouldn't bicker like the other fools talk good game\nNeva imagine all the disasters that one could reign\nCould bring!, should bling, the game, and I could\nIt's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?\nAnd forever be in debt, that's never a good thing\nTo the pressure for success can put a good strain\nOn a friend you call best, and yes it could bring\nOut the worst in every person, even the good's insane\nThough we rehearsed, it's just ain't the same\nWhen you put in the game at age sixteen\nThen you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and miss things\nJealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings\nIt all to a head like coin, cha-ching\nThe rule of evil strikes again, this could sting\nNow the team got beef between the Post and the Point\nThis puts the ring in jeopardy - indefinitely\n\n\n\n\nI feel like a black militant takin' over the government\nCan't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them\nCan't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em\nProbably in up back in the hood, I'm like, \"fuck it then\"\n\n\nI'm back in the hood, they like, \"Hey Nas\" (Uh)\nBlowin' on purp', reflectin' on they lives\nCouple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s\nDreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies\nGray 5's, hate guys wishin' our reign dies\nPitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, \"why\"?\nGuess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time\nWeak minds, keep tryin', follow the street signs\nI'm standin' on the roof of my building\nI'm feelin' - the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it\nJust like an acrobat ready to hurl myself though the hoops of fire\nSippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire\nCould it be the forces of darkness, against hood angels of good\nThat forms street politics - makes a sweet honest kid\nTurn illegal for commerce - to get his feet out of them Converse\nThat's my word\n",
