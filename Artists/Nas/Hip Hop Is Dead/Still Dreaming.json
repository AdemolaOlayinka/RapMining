You the thousandth guy\nThat came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye\nWe on a different echelon, coulda got bread together\nNow you gets deaded on\n\n\nSome people really (so keep dreamin')\nSome people really\nSome people really are (still dreamin')\nStill dreaming\n(O-o-o-o-one two one two\nSome dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin')\nThey are still dreaming\n(O-o-o-o-one two one two\nSome dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin')\n\nSome people really\nSome people really\nSome people really are\n\n\nShe had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle\nLarge master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure\nBelaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who\nWould need a cash rule, who could blast tools\nAnd I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news\nBut we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school\nGrew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews\nShe worked for Fox News\nOne of her mans that she lent her drop to\nWon't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it\nSays it's important that it looks like an accident\nShe was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it\nSheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit\nFour days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks\nCrossed the line from her world of news castin'\nTo a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards\nStill dreamin'\n",
