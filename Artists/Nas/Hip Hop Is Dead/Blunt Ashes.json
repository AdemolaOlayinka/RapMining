    "lyrics": "Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley\ngot blazed before they told stories\nI'm get blazed before I tell y'all stories\nI saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died\nSo he had him cremated, took his ashes, and then made it to a Diamond ring\nNow he watches his son shine everyday\nI just thought about that, while I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah\n\nThe makin' of a mad band\nIntricate stories of DeVante Swing\nAva Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean\nBobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes..\nPrince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome\nBut Alex was puttin' coke in his nose, nigga whylin'\nCould be a myth but I swear that the source was close,\nPhyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy, mommy was bad they say\nDonny Hathaway free fall from a balcony, he swings\n\nAs the blunt ash falls into the ash tray\nI could see my whole life fly past me\nDid I... did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nAnd will the money and fame out last me?\nThe blunt's ash falls down in the ash tray\nWill I see my whole life fly past me?\nI'm askin' did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?\nDid I?.. Anything else you wanna know, just wanna ask me?\n\nSam trusted Womack with his main lady\nHe tossin' in the grave, like, \"This is how you repay me?\"\nA change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much\nMarvin said \"No mountain's high enough, fly stuff\"\nDavid Ruffin was punching Tammi Terrell, gave her concussions\nWhile the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussion\nWhen Flo from the Supremes died, Diana Ross cried\nMany people said that she was laughin' inside\n\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's, enemies dealt with treachery\nIt interests me, Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals\nShe's what a temptress be\nThe death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery\nOr the Chicagoan Harold Washington\nSomeone is sabotaging them\nWatch out for the traps\nLarry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman\nThen he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp\nAnd I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats\nThis is what came from their pain\nFrom their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange\n\n\nI could smell old bogey cigars\nLaureen Bacall perfumes, smelling just as sweet, ha-ha\nMe and my wife K, flying in a drop-top like Ruby and Ossie Davis baby\nKnaw'mean? Yo, man. I get smoked out, and start thinkin' about\nHattie McDaniel's got a Oscar, for playin' Mammy in 'Gone With The Wind'\nAnd she didn't get allowed, wasn't even allowed to go to the premiere\nCould you believe that? Couldn't go to premiers to her joint\nTssk. Man, you know they were strong back then man\nBlunt from my ash tray, nothin' gon' to live past me, yeah, yeah, yeah\n",
