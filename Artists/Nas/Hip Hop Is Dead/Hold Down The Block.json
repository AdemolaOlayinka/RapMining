When the block is hot)\nI got families I'm feeding 'cause my mans is bleeding\nEvery five seconds look in all directions\nI come through prepared; I give 'em a call\nI'm close, bring them guns downstairs\n\n\nI gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\n\nI gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\n\n\nUh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder\nTwo niggaz dead, Tuesday\nWednesday and Thursday is hearse-day\nFriday, somebody-gotta-die-day\nSaturday, put the gat away\nChillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze\nWonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way\n'Cause Sunday back to gunplay\nMo' shit start over nothin'\nAnd get finished quick 'cause the art of repercussion\nYeah, I seen it, a G' going out indecent (When the block is hot)\nTakin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret\nEscape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15\nThen one-time intervene (I gotta lay...)\nMy man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die\nBut the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die\nYou thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty\nBut he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his forties\n\n\nI gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\n\nI gotta lay down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\n\n\n(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob\n(When the block is hot) A man rather die than live on his knees and starve\nCops steady askin' your man what happened\nFirst he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'\nGuess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off (When the block is hot)\nListen, peep game from the brain of an all-star\nThe rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot\nMetal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop\nThe streets lie, (When the block is hot) so you better be cautious\nYour man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'\nA vet, a General, don't step where I walked in\nMake your own path, be a legend in your skin\n(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)\nMake your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'\nDon't expect more when you put in less work than all them\nQueensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life\nYou heard me right, I got the block (When the block is hot)\n\n\nWhen the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\nI gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\nI gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot\nI gotta use my imagination, to change the situation\n",
