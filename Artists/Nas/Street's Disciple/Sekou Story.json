Hold me down now\nTell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?\nWho gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?\nTell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now\"\n\n\nForget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude\n'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou\nH2 full of holes, the drove him off the road\nLeft him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain\nMy soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up\nArrangement's a closed casket\nSee now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang\nsheddin' fake tears, I won't have it\nLook, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian\nBrag about how the streets needed a changin'\nSon, you the only one a bitch could call\nYou remind me of my dude, help me get them all\n\n\"Di-sci-ple\"\n\"You remind me of my dude, help me get them all\"\n\"Di-sci-ple\"\n\"You remind me of my dude, help me get them all\"\n",
