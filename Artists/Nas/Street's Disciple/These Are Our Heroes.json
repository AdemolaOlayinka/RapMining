These are our heroes.\"\n\n\nLet's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB\nWho 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?\nNever got Emmy's but were real to me\nLet's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels\n'Cause they said they played they parts well\nNow they claim caviar, hate that oxtail\nLambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel\nWhitey always tell him, \"Ooh, he speak so well\"\nAre you the one we look to, the decent Negro?\nThe acceptable Negro -- hell nah\nBut they say, \"These are our heroes\"\n\n\nUh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play\nAthletes of today in the NBA, make me proud\nBut there's somethin' they don't say\nKeep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay\nFrom OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe\nFirst he played his life cool just like Michael\nNow he rock ice too just like I do\nYo, you can't do better than that?\nThe hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?\nNow you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back\nYeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you\nYou turn around then you shit on Shaq\nWho woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes\nHe love a little butt crack, got enough cash\nLittle kids with they bus pass who look up to you\nTo do something for the youth, stupid spoof\nBut you let them use you as an example\nThey would rep, but our heroes got they hands full\n\n\n\n\nYou Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles\nBut we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through\nBut what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black\nbut your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque\nYou don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface\nYou don't know what you feel, y'all too safe\nElection done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it\nHuh, and in the end we all got dicked\nThese are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot\nStill harassed by cops, snitches on blocks\nSellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout\nTavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson\nStokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them\nNicky Giovanni poetical black female\nJim Brown to the people who sing well from\nFela to Miriam Makeba\nThe mirror says you are the next American leader\nSo don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records\nThese pickaninnies get with anything to sell records\nCause it's trendy to be the conscious MC\nBut next year, who knows what we'll see?\nHa-Ha, these are our heroes\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know\nthe crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard\nBig up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up\nto Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs\nwhat up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit\nand ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit.\"\n\n\"Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though\nhomie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at\nall that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in\nmy hood. What type of shit is that?\"\n\n\n\n\"I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please\nLet me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I\ngot a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha\nyeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE.\"\n\n\"Come on nigga, give back to the hood. Cocky\nmotherfucker!\"\n",
