Let us pray...\nIn a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers\nEverybody in tuxes gettin' blunted\nHard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though\nFactual, the pimp shall scoop no more\nYes, I'm absolutely sure\nI know that she love me, I know that she faithful\nWe spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz Will and Jada ain't need it\nSpoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought\nCuz she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit\nBut know this, you fuckin' wit a slit ya throat quick\nBehicular explosions, cigar smokin'\nDark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken\nSafer world of broke men to rich ones\nThrow them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun\nHeaded to the Chapel, my niggas laughin\nAnd it's bafflin cuz just a year ago\nIt's weird, though, I knew I'd get married\nTo who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock\nPumpin' Sade, my head knot\nFinally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my french, rephrase that\nSomeone who made my heart stop, couldn't wait to blaze that\nTired of hoppin' from honey to honey\nHIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies\nThe game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street\nI want a son to greet every mornin'\nDaughters and more sons tickle my feet\nWife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat\nI'm gettin' married\n\n\nIt was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride\nEven Marrin Luther King had a fling on the side\nThat's what the negative ones say\nKnew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day\nI know the hoes gonna miss me\nLookin' at old photos, sayin, \"Damn, used to twist me\"\nStart chokin' up since I woke up\nBachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up\nFather saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm\nTold me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'\nSaid she would love me and my eyes were boating\nCustomized in London by guys who suit up kings\nGov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave\nMaxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang\nBaltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi\nFamily packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy\nSpilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out\nWatched in the church, just all big to thug it out\nMy girl walked in glistenin', different stones\n'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones\nThat's a union nobody can touch\nI gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles\nCuz I love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit\nCourt cases, baby mommas\nI make an honest woman outta you yet\nEverybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'\nHeart poundin' out my chest like a cannon\nI'm happy, one of my Groom's men\nUnder the music says, \"Don't do it\"\nBut they just joke, some crew shit\nThey playin, I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'\nI'm sayin' vows that are all true\n\"Will you take music as your wedded wife?\"\n\"I do.\"\nSike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to\nGettin' married\n",
