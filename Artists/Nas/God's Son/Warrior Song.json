Braveheart y'all\nThis to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion\nTo everybody that lost their mother, their father\nRest in peace moms!\nMy mother's last words:\nNever give up\nA true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war\nLove ya girl, y'kno keep marchin'\nYea yea yea, you never give up\nTo all my warriors, haha\nBraveheart, Braveheart\nDefinition of a warrior\n",
