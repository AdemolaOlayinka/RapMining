Get down, get down!\" -\n\nEverybody\n\"Get down, get down! Get down, get down!\" -\n\n\n\nSome niggaz fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em\nWeird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em\nThey make you, dissapear, this a year that I won't forget\nSold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs\nSouthern niggaz, independent label, real killers\nKnow the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin\nThey had the coke game somethin crazy\nSold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me\nPut me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin\nTook a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them\nSouthern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me\nI left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy\nNow I'm back around the old school that raised me\nNew York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see\nA dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay\nThe letter say, \"Nas I got your back - the fools don't play\"\nI rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral\nNever saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible\nThe nigga still alive in a hospital\nMidnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too\nSee my cousin's in the game, thuggin and things\nHe plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano\nGave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano\nShe passed me the indigo, but the imbecile\nshoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed\nOpenin the hotel room do', to let her goons in\nBut I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit\nI let the hammers blow, wet three kids\nSee honey thought I had somethin to do, with all the drama\nCause I was with a crew, that had her people killed\nCalled up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin witchu\nHe responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers\n\n\"Get down, get down! Get down, get down!\" -\n\nEverybody\n\"Get down, get down! Get down, get down!\" -\n\n\n\nAll I really gotta say is that\nif that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?\nHow we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?\nA shame when you ain't look at it\nMy folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk\nSomebody gotta make a change\n",
