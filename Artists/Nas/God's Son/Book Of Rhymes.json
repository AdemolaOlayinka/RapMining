Nah it's weak)\nThe money's ya religion sky the limit live life\nNumbers is big business makes the poor live trife\nThe glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream\nThrough your existence become wealthy knowledge is king\nPimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck\nAddicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society\nCops that shoot blacks is routine for noteriety\nGrow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms\nBeautiful ladies on their arms\nDangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas\nRubbin my lips with Campophenique\nStill behind the ears wet turned out to be\nPioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...\n(Nah that was weak there)\nMy people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale\nPardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell\nIt's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real\nI can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies\nI see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style\nAnd they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit\nI pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie\nMy nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be\nMy book of rhymes\n\nThis can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!\n(My Book of Rhymes)\nNah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?\nHuh you a funny nigga... naw yeah\n(My Book of Rhymes)\nI'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now\nFuck that I'ma write again now fuck that\nI musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?\n\nLook how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood\nOur values so low our values are no good\nThings our mothers told us we shoulda heeded\nCause now we need it\nWe older almost able t...\nI'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?\nSmelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit\nAiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way\nSuch a innocent child is what some say\nI get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are\nLike a star not a worry in this world thus far\nBut wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention\nI must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant\n(Kinda crazy)\n",
