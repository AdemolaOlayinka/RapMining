Where them dimes at?\n\nThey shootin'! -- Aw made you look\nYou a slave to a page in my rhyme book\nGettin' Big/\"big\" money, playboy your time's up\nWhere them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?\n\n\nThis ain't rappin, this is Street-Hop\nNow get up off your ass like your seat's hot\nMy live niggaz lit up the reefer\nTrunk'a the car we got the streetsweeper\nDon't start none, won't be none\nNo reason for your mans to panic\nYou don't wanna see no ambulances\nKnock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup\nThat's the way you get Timberland'd up\nLet the music diffuse all the tension\nBall or convention, free admission\nHustlers, dealers and killers'ca move swift\nGirls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept\nAll my just-comin' homies, parolees\nGet money, leave the beef alone slowly\nGet out my face, you people so phoney\nPull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty\n\n\n\n\n\nI see niggaz runnin', yo my mood is real rude\nI lay you out, show you what steel do\nMobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges\nEvery invitation to fight you punk hazas\nLike Pun said, \"You ain't even en mi clasa\"\nMaybach Benz, back seat, tv plasma\nLadies lookin for athletes or rappers\nWhatever you choose, whatever you do\nMake sure he a thug and intelligent too\nLike a real thoroughbred is, show me love\nLemme feel how the head is\nFemales whose the sexiest is always the nastiest\n\nAnd I like a little sassiness, a lotta class\nMommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth\nI'm a leader, at last this a don you wit'\nMy nines'll spit, niggaz loose consciousness\n",
