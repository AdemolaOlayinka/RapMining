Would you Testify?\nYou buy my songs\nYou buy my songs\nbut will you ride with me?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nYou understand my struggle\nThat's what you claim right?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nThen get your aim right\nAnd get your game tight\n\n\nDon't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it\nComing to concerts singing hoe'ing shit\nFuck y'all lil' lil' hoe bitches\nI don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it\nI heard y'all was downloading it (heh)\nlike I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)\nlike uhh, William Cooper\nwho told you the (Pale Horse) is the future\n\n\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nWould you testify on some realness like that?\nI think you scared (heh)\nI don't think you prepared\nYeah\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nYou know what I'm asking you?\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nDo you know what I'm asking you?\nWow...\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\nWow...\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\n(Testifyyyyy for me)\n",
