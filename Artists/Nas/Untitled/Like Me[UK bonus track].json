How you doin baby?\nOh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby\nAy check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?\nAy let me put the bug in your ear baby\nWant you turnin them hoe shoes into some flows shoes, you dig?\nYeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness\nYou know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you\nGuess why, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp\n\n\n(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe\n(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase\nIn this life there's pimps and hoes\nTell me which one are you, you a nigga\n(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe\n(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase\nIn this life there's pimps and hoes\nTell me which one are you\n\n\nThe good man in me say \"Get money and stay on the path\"\nBut the pimp shit in me say \"Yo, keep lookin for ass\"\nBut my daughter gave me a gift, somethin to hold\nA little city in water, when you shake it, it snow\nI told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes\nBetter wait till you grown, when he love you, you'll know\nEverybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two\nCylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick\nWith friends to get against who I don't know\nSomeone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake\nThey mistake blamin me for they failures, I'm fresh, gettin tailored\nSingle breasted, a lip brush, it's senseless, some pimp shit\nA woman hates a man and stays with him for many years\nTell him she loves him and be jealous of him\nNow lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he still with her\nShe'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga\n\n\n\n\nAy pimpin been goin on man for eons and eons man since the beginnin of time\nYou know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind and get mine\nSo the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know, do what you gotta do man\nBring my money back, get on that track and get on your back\n\n\nI heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves\nA portea wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is\nJerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings\nLet's just say more than collectively all of his players\nThat's business, not really pimp shit\nMaybe a titbit similar to when we rappers make big hits\nand not own the masters, that's the deal\nBy the way, portea helps all the Denzels excel\nHe kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out\nI knew a girl bout, 5'9\", so fine, she could result grind\nShe was sleek, sheek, with a classic mouth\nMovie directors always fucked her on the casting couch\nShe came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler\nShe not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road\nI showed her all my stones and gold\nI said \"Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga\"\n",
