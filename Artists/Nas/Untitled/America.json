I'm amongst the\nStreets deceiving\nCan't believe my achievements\nCultural strata\nPersona's that of a non-needer\nBecause I don't need nada except for Prada beaver\nFor cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless\nTo my G's on the flee from the coppers (coppers)\nStiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors (parlors)\nFrom the slums I come up a phoenix\nCaked up, tryin' to take what I'm eating\nCame up a dismissive kid (kid)\nYou lucky if you allowed to witness this\nSavvy mouth\nWhile hardly a man's man\nWho woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties\nJezebel's and Stella McCartney's?\nFor years, all that\nHow could I not be dead?\nThis old German\nSaid I was a thug with a knotty head\nLooked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled\nWith a face like he wonder where I got my bread\nProbably all these stones he see\nFrom my shows overseas\nFrom crime to rhyme\nMy story is I'm from the home of the thieves\n\n\nAmerica (America), pay attention\nWake up (America)\nThis is not what you think it is\nAmerica (America), pay attention\nWake up (America)\nThis is not what you think it is\n\n\nBlessed\nThe lord is a G, he gotta be\nWho's the God of suckers and snitches?\nThe economy\nLipstick from Marilyn Monroe\nBlew a death kiss to Fidel Castro\nHe'd want me to spit this\nOnly the strong survive\nNas bear witness\nThe hypocrisy is all I can see\nWhite cop acquitted for murder\nBlack cop cop a plea\nThat type of shit make me stop and think\nWe in chronic need of a second look of the law books\nAnd the whole race dichotomy\nToo many rappers, athletes, and actors\nBut not enough niggas in NASA\nWho give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion?\nBut when it comes to residuals, they look past us\nWoven into the fabric, they can't stand us\nEven in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandannas\n\n\nAmerica (America) pay attention\nWake up (America)\nThis is not what you think it is\nAmerica (America)\nPay attention (America)\nThis is not what you think it is\nAmerica (America)\n(This is not what you think it is)\n\n\nAssassinations\nDiplomatic relations\nKilled indigenous people\nBuilt a new nation\nInvoluntary labor\nTook a knife split a woman naval\nTook her premature baby\nLet her man see you rape her\nIf I could travel to the 1700's\nI'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite\nThrough your covenant\nLove to sit in on the Senate\nAnd tell the whole government\nY'all don't treat women fair\nShe read about herself in the bible\nBelieving she the reason sin is here\nYou played her, with an apron\nLike, \"Bring me my dinner, dear.\"\nShe the nigger here\nAin't we in the free world?\nDeath penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls\nBarbarity, I'm in the double-R casualty\nBugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me\nHow far we really from third world savagery\nWhen the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be\n\n\nAmerica (America, America)\nAmerica (America)\n(This is not what you think it is)\nAmerica (America ohhh)\nThis is not what you think it is\nAmerica\n",
