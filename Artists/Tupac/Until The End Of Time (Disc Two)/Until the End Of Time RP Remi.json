    "lyrics": "Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side\nSomewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die\nAnd even though we both came from the same places\nThe money and the fame made us all change places\nHow could it be - through the misery that came to pass\nThe hard times made a true friend afraid to ask - for currency\nBut you could run to me when you need me and I'll never leave\nI just need, someone to believe in, as you can see\nIt's a small thang to a true, what could I do?\nReal homies help you get through\nAnd come to knew he'd do the same thang if he could\nCause in the hood true homies make you feel good\nAnd half the times we be actin up call the cops\nBringin a cease to the peace that was on my block\nIt never stop, when my mama ask me will I change\nI tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same\nUntil the end of time\n\n\nSo take, these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time\nUntil the end of time\n\n\nPlease Lord forgive me for my life of sin\nMy hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids\nSo you know, I don't hang around the house much\nThis all night, money making got me outta touch, shit\nAin't flashed a smile in a long while\nAn unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs\nMy attitude got me walkin solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo\nWatchin the whole world move in slow-mo\nFor quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean\nSmokin 'Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin\nWho can I trust in this cold world?\nMy phony homey had a baby by my old girl\nBut I ain't trippin I'm a player I ain't sweatin him\nI sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican\nHis next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen\nBesides rappin the only thing I did good was scrappin\nUntil the end of time\n\n\n\n\nNow who's to say if I was right or wrong?\nTo live my life as an Outlaw all along\nRemain strong in this planet full of player haters\nThey conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators\nAnd in the end drinkin Heneessy made all my enemies envy me\nSo cold when I flow eliminatin easily\nFalls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath\nWhile beggin me to keep the peace (haha)\nWhat I can see closer to achieve\nIn times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G\nFollow my lead I'll supply everything you need\nAn ounce of game and the trainin to make a G\nRemember me, as an outcast Outlaw\nAnother album out, that's what I'm about, more\nGettin raw 'til the day I see my casket\nBuried as a G while the whole world remembers me\nUntil the end of time\n",
