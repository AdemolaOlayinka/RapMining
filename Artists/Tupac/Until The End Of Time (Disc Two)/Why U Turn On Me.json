    "lyrics": "(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers..)\nOutlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up\nHahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin on me?\nWhy me? Westside, how you do it boy?\n\n\nI went from, nothin to somethin now they all wanna see me fall\nAnd the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball\nAnd they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny\nGot a lot of love for, any niggaz gettin money\nI made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped\nIt was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch\nY'all niggaz hypocrites and bitch made\nNow either love me or hate me but real thug niggaz get paid\nHave me catchin cases all across the nation\nI went to jail to bail to barely on probation\nThey got a player facin three strikes, and we might\njust blast God bless the child that can get cash\nBut all these niggaz turnin and never learn\nGot a long line of niggaz player hatin me but gettin burned\nTalk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag\nLike the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back pay\n\n\nWhy you wanna turn on me?\nNever thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin on me?)\nWhen you niggaz see me you flee (Why me?)\nCause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)\nWhy you wanna turn on me?\nNever thought you would backstab me\nWhen you niggaz see me you flee\nCause I'm a T-H with the U-G\n\n\n\n\nIt, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct\nApproach the juvenile delinquent, we still decent\nPlayin catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs\nFuck school we was skippin drink a fifth on the curb\nMe and you, no closer two, while drinkin brew\nWhat you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga\nYou can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes\nGave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door\nBut then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye\nMy time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?\nI never got a single visit yet I carry on\nAll my old friends too busy now my money gone\nSaid I got raped in jail, picture that? {*laughter*}\nRevenge is a payback bitch, get your gat\nFuck {Wendy Williams} and I pray you choke\non the next dick down your throat, for turnin on me\n\n\n\n\nI put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll\nAnybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} fat ass?\nWhy you always wearin Spandex you fat bitch?\nI know your pussy stinks, you fat hoe\nI'm puttin Jenny Craig on you bitch\nI'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit\nthrough Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass\nand put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!\nThug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch\nIt's Tupac so you know who said it\nAnd for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick\nand Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!\nIf a nigga didn't want to get talked about\nhe shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin ring\nIf Tyson don't want to get knocked out\nhe don't step in the fuckin ring, that's how the shit go\nWhen Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!\nWell that's what Tupac gon' do\nWhen niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!\nOne way or the motherfuckin other\nThis old motherfuckin nigga in the South told me nigga\nIt's more than one way to skin a cat\nIt's more than one way to shoot a gat\nIt's more than one way to die nigga\nWhen I'm through, everybody cry nigga\nThis is how we do it\n\n\n\n\nFuck you too nigga!\n",
