    "lyrics": "Hehehe, these are my words to my first born..\n\n\nCan you picture, young niggaz in a rush to grow\ntil hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat\nProbably never even saw it comin - too busy bullshittin\nCaught him with his mouth runnin; ain't this a bitch\nThey got me twisted in this game\nThe feds and the punk, po-lice pointin pistols at my brain\nI wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out\nMy homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house\nwhat was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped\ncause niggaz died over bullshit - it's not my dream\nI'm seein pictures of a broken man, no witnesses\nOnly the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents\nin our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical\nWe hobble through these tryin times, livin blind\nLord help me with my troubled soul\nWhy all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?\nAnd right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love\nto the thugs in heaven I'll see you there\nIt's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned\nHelp you make it through the storm\nMy words to my first born, feel me\n\n.. My words to my first born\n.. My words to my first born\n\n\nSince my very first day on this earth, I was cursed\nSo I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse\nAnd though it hurt me there was no distortion\nCause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions\nQuiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do\nAnd so did victims of a world they never came to\nI understand it's a better day comin\nSometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end\ndrivin with the car runnin blinded\nAin't no love in the hood only hearts torn\nLove letters to the innocent and unborn\nAll the babies that died up on the table\nWasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able\nCan't - blame her I would do the same\nAll I could give it was my debt and my last name\nCause in the game things change livin up and down\nThis hard life got me walkin with my head down\nFlashin frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?\nBut I'll never get to know, so I carry on\nIt's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born\nMy words to my first born, feel me\n\n.. My words to my first born\n.. Mmm! (Yeah) These are the words to my first born\n.. Hey nigga talk to your born, talk to your seed nigga\n\n\nTwo thousand somethin somethin it's a new era\nA nigga's too real, now see shit too clear\nSee there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt\n(What else is it dawg?)\nThe velvet and the silk, and makin sure my kittens got they milk\n(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress, let my kids know I'm at this\nAttack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll\nAin't no question is it? Above the Law hustlers\nIf it's related to chips, homey we'll handle ya\n\nYo..\nAlthough we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang\nBy all means, stack green, gangsta lean\nThey say money make the world go 'round\nSo only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers\nand niggaz that's truly down - and keep God first\nAnd give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts\nIt's player haters every corner you hit\nTouchin their tits, hella thick, tryin to get you for yo' grip\nI know you stressed out and fed up\nBut come out, gun-blazin, and keep yo' head up\nYou can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change\nAbove the Law, 2Pac, O.G.'s in this rap game\nAnd we done lived a long hard life\nAnd we done shed so many tears under these bright lights\nY'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned\nWe still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born\n\n\nWhat you gon' tell your kids nigga?\nWho was you? What was you doin? How did you put it down?\nThese my words to my motherfuckin first born\nso they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe\nAin't nuttin but a motherfuckin rider, Wessyde 'til I die\nThat's all it was, it's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker\nI just played to win, just played to win\nMotherfucker gotta bet agains the odds..\n",
