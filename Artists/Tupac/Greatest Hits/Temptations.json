Drop that shit!\nYou know what time, boo-yaow, I know it's time for you\nSo grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'\nAnd uh, throw up that finger\nAyo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?\n\nTell me baby are you lonely?\nDon't wanna rush ya, I can help ya if ya only\nLet me touch ya, if I'm wrong love tell me\n'cause I get caught up, and the life I live is Hell see\nI never thought I'd see, the day when I would calm down\nYou ain't heard, I've been known to clown and Get Around\nThat's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good\nYes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me\nWith your attitude to match right?\nDon't be phony, 'cause I hate when you act like\nYou don't know me I've be stressin' in the spotlight\nI want the fame, but the industry's a lot like\nA crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go\nCan't be with you every minute miss, another show\nAnd even though I'm known for my one night stand\n(Look here) I wanna be an honest man\nBut temptations go\n\nThrow up the finger! And all my homies go\nThrow them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like\n\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy, and get the job done\nYou say you needed, a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care\n\nWill I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows\nGettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go\nIn my ride and I'm all in\nGettin' high, I can hear the people callin'\nI'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'\nAnd to God, gotta keep myself from fall-in\nBut it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure\nWhat do I do, gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up\nAnd say it's cool, should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide\nIf you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie\nMove close and let me whisper\nSome dirty words in your ears as I kiss ya\nOn every curve, slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow\nCan't hold it any longer, so let it go\nOpen the gates to your waterfall up in heaven\nAnd don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was\n\nGive 'em the finger!\nAll my homies go, throw your fingers up\nThat's just the Thug in me girl, you know\nPeep out all my homies, y'know, it's like\n\nI know you've been searchin' for someone\nTo make you happy, and get the job done\nYou say you needed, a man with money\nBut I can't be there, and will you still care\n\nA lotta people think it's easy\nTo settle down, got a woman that'll please me\nIn every town, I don't wanna but I gotta do it\nThe temptation got me ready to release the fluid Sensation, sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand\n'Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand\nEven the hardest of my homies need attention\nCatch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'\nI wanna take you to the movies, and the park\nLet's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark\nNow that it's passion, hold me tight\nDon't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight\nI know your man ain't lovin' you right\nYou're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life\nEnough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'\nSee you later, 'cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was\n\nGive 'em the finger, and all my homies go\nYo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?\nThrow your fingers up\nYou know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you\n(Everybody, hey, alright\nHey, heyyyeah, heyyyayy, oh)\nAll my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!\nThrow your hands up, give em the finger!\n",
