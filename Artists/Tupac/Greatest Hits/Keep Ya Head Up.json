    "lyrics": "Little something for my godson Elijah\nAnd a little girl named Corin\nSome say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nI say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots\nI give a holla to my sisters on welfare\n2Pac cares if don't nobody else care\nAnd I know they like to beat you down a lot\nWhen you come around the block, brothers clown a lot\nBut please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up\nForgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up\nAnd when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him\nAnd if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him\n'Cause, sister, you don't need him\nAnd I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em\nYou know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy\nAnd since we all came from a woman\nGot our name from a woman and our game from a woman\nI wonder why we take from our women\nWhy we rape our women, do we hate our women?\nI think it's time to kill for our women\nTime to heal our women, be real to our women\nAnd if we don't we'll have a race of babies\nThat will hate the ladies that make the babies\nAnd since a man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up?\nI know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings'll get brighter\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings'll get brighter\nAyo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me\nHe had me feeling like black was the thing to be\nAnd suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough\nAnd though we had it rough, we always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with the local crew and had a smoke or two\nAnd I realize momma really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\nI'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay the rent\nAnd in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars but can't feed the poor\nSay there ain't no hope for the youth\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\nI blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a set-up\nAnd even though you're fed up\nHuh, you got to keep your head up\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings'll get brighter\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings'll get brighter\nAnd uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em\n'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more\n'Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son\nWants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'\nYou can't complain you was dealt this\nHell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\nDying inside, but outside you're looking fearless\nWhile tears is rolling down your cheeks\nYou steady hoping things don't fall down this week\n'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it\nAnd don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it\nAnd now my son's getting older and older and colder\nFrom having the world on his shoulders\nWhile the rich kids is driving Benz\nI'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends\nAnd it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up\nBut please, you got to keep your head up\n",
