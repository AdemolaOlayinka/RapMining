It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me\nFrom hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me\nShit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed\nNothing more I despise than a liar\nCowards die\nMy mama told me when I was a seed\nJust a vicious motherfucker why these devils left me free\nI proceed to make them shiver\nWhen I deliver\nCriminal lyrics\nFrom a world wide mob figure\nThug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli\nNiggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me\nSo many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw\nSwitching up on you ordinary bitches\nLike a southpaw you get left\nAnd every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased\nWill be another moment ballin' as a 'G'\nI rip the crowd, then I start again\nEternally I live in sin\nUntil the moment that they let me breathe again\nThe heartz of men\nThe hearts of men\nMy lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts\nMy guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse\nBitch niggas get their eyes swoll\nIn fly mode\nI'm a homicidal outlaw\nAnd 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on\nTonight's gonna be a fucking fight\nSo we might roll\nMy own homies say I'm heartless\nBut I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless\nRide by, niggas bow down\nThought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now\nThrow up your hands if you thugged out\nFirst nigga act up\nFirst nigga getting drugged out\nI can be a villain if ya let me\nBut motherfucker if ya do upset me\nTell the cops to come and get me\nRip the crowd like a phone number\nThen start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga\nLook inside the hearts of men\nIn the hearts of men\nTo all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states\nKeep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch\nNo longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand\nConvinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man\nGive me my money and label me as a don\nIf niggas is having problems\nSmoke' em, fire and bomb\nI died and came back\nI hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack\nThugging is in my spirit\nI'm lost and not knowing\nScared up, but still flowing\nEnergized and still going\nUh, can it be fate\nThat makes a sick motherfucker break\nOn these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake\nWhat will it take ?\nGive me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb\nDeath Row, baby, don't be alarmed\nThe homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again\nRepresent\nCause I've been sent\nThe hearts of men\n",
