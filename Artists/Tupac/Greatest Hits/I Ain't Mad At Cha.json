No more dope game\nHeard you might be comin' home, just got bail\nWanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail\nIt seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man\nHit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan\nWhen I talk about money all you see is the struggle\nWhen I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble\nCongratulations on the wedding, I hope your wife know\nShe got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'\nI know we grew apart, you probably don't remember\nI used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her\nAnd I can see us after school, we'd BOMB\non the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on\nNow the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it\nGot a big money scheme and you ain't even with it\nHmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that\nGo toe to toe when it's time to roll you got a brother's back\nAnd I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin' at 'cha\nYou tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead\nCause I ain't mad at 'cha\n(Hmm, I ain't mad at 'cha)\n\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n\nWe used to be like distant cousins\nFightin', playin' dozens, whole neighborhood buzzin'\nKnowin' that we wasn't\nUsed to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs\nI'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared\nBesides, bumpin' 'n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind\nIn time we'd learned to live a life of crime\nRewind us back to a time was much too young to know\nI caught a felony lovin' the way the guns blow\nAnd even though we separated, you said that you'd wait\nDon't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state\nI kiss my momma, goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes\nSaid I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived\nDon't shed a tear, cause momma I ain't happy here\nI blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years\nThey got me goin' mad\nI'm knockin' busters on they backs, in my cell, thinkin'\n\"Hell, I know one day I'll be back\"\nAs soon as I touch down\nI told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down\nThe homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha\nCause you's a down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha\n\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(a true down ass bitch and I ain't mad at 'cha)\n\nWell guess who's movin' up, this nigga's ballin' now\nBitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down\nHe went from nothing to lots, ten carats to rock\nWent from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block\nHe's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's\nMost hated by enemies, escape in the luxury\nSee, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made\nNow we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days\nSo full of pain while the weapons blaze\nGettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days\nCause crime pays and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze\nYou'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days\nSo many changed on me, so many tried to plot\nThat I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?\n'Til God return me to my essence\nCause even as an adolescent, I refuse to be a convalescent\nSo many questions and they ask me if I'm still down\nI moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?\nThey got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at 'cha\nYou niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at 'cha\n\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(Hell nah I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(And I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n(I ain't mad at 'cha)\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\nI ain't - mad - at 'cha\n",
