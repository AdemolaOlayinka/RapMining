    "lyrics": "You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion\nHappiness, living on the streets is a delusion\nEven a smooth criminal one day must get caught\nShot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought\nNine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me\n'Cause they never talk peace in the black community\nAll we know is violence, do the job in silence\nWalk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants\nToo many brothers daily heading for the big pen\nNiggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in\nOver the years I done a lot of growin' up\nGetting drunk, throwin' up\nCuffed up\nThen I said I had enough\nThere must be another route, way out\nTo money and fame, I changed my name\nAnd played a different game\nTired of being trapped in this vicious cycle\nIf one more cop harasses me I just might go psycho\nAnd when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush\nOnly a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed\nYo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G\nBut keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi\nThey got me trapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\nThey got me trapped\nCan barely walk the city streets\nWithout a cop harassing me, searching me\nThen asking my identity\nHands up, throw me up against the wall\nDidn't do a thing at all\nI'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall\nCuffed up throw me on the concrete\nCoppers try to kill me\nBut they didn't know this was the wrong street\nBang, bang, count another casualty\nBut it's a cop who's shot for his brutality\nWho do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain\nHe got caught in the chains of his own game\nHow can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?\nSweated me, hunted me\nTrapped in my own community\nOne day I'm gonna bust\nBlow up on this society\nWhy did ya lie to me?\nI couldn't find a trace of equality\nWork me like a slave while they laid back\nHomie, don't play that\nIt's time I let 'em suffer the payback\nI'm trying to avoid physical contact\nI can't hold back, it's time to attack jack\nThey got me trapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\nNow I'm trapped and want to find my getaway\nAll I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay\nCan't use the phone\n'Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in\nDid it before\nAin't scared to use my gat again\nI look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant\nBut now he's the devil's friend\nToo late to be tellin' him\nHe shot first and I'll be damned if I run away\nHomie is done away, I should've put my gun away\nI wasn't thinking, all I heard was the ridicule\nGirlies was laughin', Tup saying, \"Damn homies is dissing you.\"\nI fired my weapon\nStarted steppin' in the hurricane\nI got shot so I dropped\nFeelin' a burst of pain\nGot to my feet\nCouldn't see nothin' but bloody blood\nNow I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer\nRan through an alley\nStill lookin' for my getaway\nCoppers said, \"Freeze, or you'll be dead today.\"\nTrapped in a corner\nDark and I couldn't see the light\nThoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life\nWhat do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?\nI'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell\nThey got me trapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nThey got me trapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nUh, uh, they can't keep the black man down\nTrapped\nNaw, they can't keep the black man down\n",
