Playa\n\nO- to the muthafuckin G, I break crazy\nA lot of niggas hate me but they can't fade me\nStop me, clock me, cops wanna Glock me\nBut the punk motherfucking pigs can't stop me\nUHH am I a G, I got proof\nBanged in my youth, keep niggas on the roof\nWith a scope, dough, Cube keep the rope\n2Pac'll string a nigga up if the mob don't\nSo whats up, punk?\nYou want what I got, step to me wrong fuck around and get shot\nYour moms crying fuck her bust her\nBitch start screaming to me and I'll dust her\nPops got the LP phat, track on hit\nLaid by the mutha fuckin' Bobcat\nNinety three suckas want me to go out\nThrow the ho out, bitch muthafucker I'm rich\n2Pac's in the muthafucking house\nNigga I'm loc'd, 2Pac's gonna get'cha motherfuckers\nGot any last words\n\nNow they're after me, why?, cause a nigga's Black\nSpittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back\nLet em come step to a real muthafucker\n(Boom Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers\nDan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked\nWhere was you when there was niggas in the caskets\nMuthafucker Rednecks all the same\nFear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained\nThat's why we burn shit and wreck\nCause the punk police ain't learned shit yet\nYou mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price\nCan't make a Black life, don't take a Black life\nIt's on, the next real nigga fall dead\nDread, jheri curl, process, or bald head\nBe prepared for the smoke to bust\nWhat niggas need to do is start loc'in up\nUnited we stand divided we fall\nThey can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all\nLet's get along with the Mexicans\nAnd we can all have peace on the sets again\nImagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)\nKeeping the smile off they White face\nI ain't racist but lets trade places\nTrace the hate 'n face it\nOne nigga teach two niggas\nThree teach four niggas\nAnd them niggas teach more niggas\nAnd when we blast\nThat'll be the biggest blast you've heard\nAnd them is my last wordz\n",
