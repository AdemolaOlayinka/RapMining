    "lyrics": "This Motherfucking life I lead\nshit\nA hell of motherfucking road blocks\nAnd crooked cops\nWe still ride though\nWhat side?\nWestside\n\nI want money in large amounts\nMy garage full of cars that bounce\nMovin' my tapes in major ways\nCause every dollar counts\nBustas is jealous\nAnd half these nigas is punks\nThey runnin' off at the mouth\n'Till I fill up with my pump\nThey jump\nMy automatic keep 'em weary\nWhile you fronting like you Billy bad ass\nNigga you scary\nI been knowing you for years\nWe was high school peers\nIn Junior High\nI was itchin' to kill\nAnd you was ready to die\nWhile you bullshitting\nNiggas was dying and catching cases\nBusting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places\nLeaving no trace\nThey see my face and then they buried\nThem bitches die in a hurry\nStill I ride\nI'm never worried\nMr. Makaveli\nTell me to ride and I'ma ride\nPick my enemies out the crowd\nAnd muthafuckas die\nIt's not the way I wanna live\nMy nigga\nIt's how it is\nHomie got into a fight\nLast night they killed his kids\n\nIn this life I lead\nFiend for currency\nGet high off weed\nCollect g's\nMake my enemies bleed\nWhen you see me nigga\nHolla my set\nAnd watch them ride\nOutlaw mother fuckers\n'Till we die\nIn this life I lead\n\nI ain't a killer but don't push me dog\nFor that family I'll send that ass straight to God (what you doing nigga?)\nAnd in this life I lead\nI've seen the most\nOf my 23 years\nMy vision is blurry\nThe money is clear\nSome of my peers\nEternally will sleep in a coffin (yeah nigga)\nAnd noble on the road\nI'm extremely cautious (westside nigga you know how we do it)\nIt happened that fast\nSplit second your gone\nAt the top of my tombstone\nPut noble is raw\nOutlaw\n'Till I'm under the floor\nFor Kadafi the prince\nI stack dough like a clock on the bricks\nWith a watch on my wrist dog\nI know the time these days\nWe outlaws\nWe gonna die this way (nigga)\nWe already in the history books\nPac made sure of that\nWhateva you took\nWe taking it back\nYou know it's all for the foundation\nOutlaws\nWe still building the thug nation\nHolla at your homie\n\nIn this life I lead\nFiend for currency\nGet high off weed\nCollect g's\nMake my enemies bleed\nWhen you see me nigga\nHolla my set\nAnd watch them ride\nOutlaw mother fuckers\n'Till we die\nIn this life I lead\n\nIt ain't but nothing air between us\nOxygen is gettin hot\nGot a problem\nMo' fag ass nigga kick rocks\nNow *censored* on the phone\nAnd the nigga talking crazy\nI don't know who to blame\nHim or *censored* for killing babies\nI'm a New Jers' Devil\nThe street created rebel\nOnly got one shot to produce\nOn every level\nThis is Maximus\nGo to the max I must\nNigga I came from not much\nSo money I clutch\nUhuh\nNapolean the strength of strong arm\nWith a dick they whistle and ride\nI put a move up on\nI'm a\nHardcore\nProduct of the ghetto\nBeen blessed fo' sho\nTo eat from out the ghetto\nI maneuver in the right lane\nQuick to push back lanes\nSwitch it to the left lane\nI play with my hands\nAnd I'm plotting on the fortune\nIt's gettin hot and scorching\nI'm thinking like a scorpion\nThat torturing an enemy\n\nIn this life I lead\nFiend for currency\nGet high off weed\nCollect g's\nMake my enemies bleed\nWhen you see me nigga\nHolla my set\nAnd watch them ride\nOutlaw mother fuckers\n'Till we die\nIn this life I lead\n\nNow with this outlaw lifestyle\nThat I've been introduced to\nMoney and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer (what's up Kurupt)\nSteady seducing us\nAnd I'm all for it\nIt's the life for me\nAnd the law cant spoil it\nSo you can call it what the fuck you want (right)\nBut I'm a baller alcoholic with a sawn-off pump (nigga)\nMy mamma ain't raise no punk\nAnd even dead Pac\nSo when I jump off\nI breathe for Yak\nBeen puttin in work\nSo I walk with a bop\nAnd it safe at home\nSo I sleep with a glock (no mistakes)\nThug living\nUgh\nWhat the fuck would be better\nI do my dirt with the family\nSo we dying together\n\nWe on a mission for mo'\nGangsta shit on you hoes\nWe ain't fucking with you lawyers\nCrossing niggas up out there dough\nTrying to live godzilla\nEdi went from a bad boy\nTo a anybody killer\nLook out\nWanted man\nGuns in hand\nStand firm\nNuts are my pride\nNow lets burn\nBound and profound\nGoing down swinging\nHolding my ground\nWe the last ones breathing\nNo stopping till we eating\nDeep in the trenches\nSo many killings\nIt's senseless\nSo in this life I lead\nI stay protected\nMy god my squad\nAnd this thing in my palm\nNow all my hustling motherfuckers\nGet your money\nSing along\n\nIn this life I lead\nFiend for currency\nGet high off weed\nCollect g's\nMake my enemies bleed\nWhen you see me nigga\nHolla my set\nAnd watch them ride\nOutlaw mother fuckers\n'Till we die\nIn this life I lead\nThis motherfucking life I lead nigga\nYou know what time it is\nWestside\nDeathrow\nDogg pound\nEverybody killer\nBad boy killer\nkiller\nAnybody killer\nFuck all y'all niggas\nIf it ain't westside nigga it ain't Pac\nThat's on my momma\n",
