When we ride on our enemies\n\n\nHEYYYY! Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town\nLet my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now\nWhat they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?\nUsed to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz\nAm I wrong? Niggaz makin songs, tryin to get with us\nMust be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust\nTo the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come\nshinin back to brighten up the sky, many die\nHeard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!\nI cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie\nTHEN! We watch the other two die slow\nCastrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow\nBAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes\nI can't stand you hoes, uhh\nNow label this my fuckin trick shot\nMy lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop\nWhen we RIDE - on our enemies\n\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nI bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nBet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies\n\n\nCome take a journey through my mind's eye\nYou crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye\nWatch my eyes when I pull the trigger\nSo right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes\nYou was HEARTLESS on yo' hits\nNiggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention\nHere's a word to those that robbed me\nI murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me\nNigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?\nSee me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell\nHow many niggaz wanna be involved?\nSee I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball\nThen tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed\nFuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz\nBefore I leave, make sure everybody HEARD\nKnow I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD\nWhen we ride on our enemies\n\nWhen we ride on our enemies\nMake sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies\nWhen we ride on our enemies, hehe\nI make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies\n",
