(Don't sleep)\nGet you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)\nI'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me\nYou walk in, exploded and leave reload\nYou don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me\nBut you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G\nNo three niggaz here are gonna let me be\nor get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga\n\n\n\n\nA nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row\nThree wheel motion, comin through coastin\nWho's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out\nM.O.B.! Nigga we ride\nI hit the charts like a stick-up kid\n#1 in the nation\nI fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation\nFaced with incarceration\nMove tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation\nGIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song\nMurder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone\nOne love to my thug niggaz\nAnd fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz\nThrow yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope\nNever come against the massive smoke, on Death Row\nMy adversaries BLEED\nBut fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE'rybody think they understand me\nShit, you niggaz don't know me\nY'all know that nigga on the rap song\nY'all know that nigga in the movies\nYou don't know this nigga in 3-D\nReal live right up against you in front of yo' face\nShit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man\n\n\nWestside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe\nYou fuckin with a changed man\nHahaha.. you fuckin with a changed man\nHahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man\nWe ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man\nWe ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man\nChanged man\n",
