Better days\nGot me thinkin bout better days\n\n\nTime to question our lifestyle, look how we live\nSmokin weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids\nwanna try now, they lie down and get ran through\nNobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do\nFaced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin\nGuess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens\nCause even our birthdays is cursed days\nA born thug in the first place, the worst ways\nI'd love to see the block in peace\nWith no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast\nAnd only we can change\nIt's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same\nToo many murders, too many funerals and too many tears\nJust seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years\nPassed by his family, but what could I say?\nKeep yo' head up and try to keep the faith\nAnd pray for better days\n\nBetter days, better days, heyyy!\nBetter days.. got me thinkin bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHeyyy! Better days\nGot me thinkin bout better days\n\n\nThinkin back as an adolescent, who would've guessed\nthat in my future years, I'd be stressin\nSome say the ghetto's sick and corrupted\nPlus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with\nTryin to keep my head up and stay strong\nAll my homies slangin llello all day long, but they wrong\nSo I'm solo and so broke\nSavin up for some Jordan's, cause they dope\nI got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I\nI can't take her to the place she wanna go to\nSo we argue and play fight, all day and night\nMakin passionate love 'til the daylight\nPlus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent\nGuess it's time to see who really is yo' friend\nTell me you pregnant and I'm amazed\nSo many blessings while we stressin\nLookin for them better days\n\nFor better days, better days, better days, heyyy!\nBetter days.. got me thinkin bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHeyyy! Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days\n\n\nNow me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools\nSince back in high school, we was true, me and you\nHardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded\nAffiliated with gangbangers and still made it\nUp in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him\nStill dressin like grown men when rollin\nI went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin marks\nGot a place in my heart, homey stay smart\nLocked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten\nI send you letters with naked flicks of old friends\nHopin you well, I know it's hell\nDoin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail\nAnd me I'm doin cool\nI settled down, had a family, workin in night school\nEvery once in a while, I reminisce\nAnd wonder how we ever came to this\nI miss the better days\n\nBetter days, better days, heyyy!\nBetter days.. I'm thinkin bout better days\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHeyyy! Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days\n\nI send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown\nRikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, hehe\nE Block, F Block, lower H\nN-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate\nAll the peoples I met along the way\nBetter days is comin homeboy, keep your head up\n\nBetter days, better days, better days\nHeyyy! Better days.. uhh, lookin for the better days\nBetter days, better days, lookin for the better days\nHeyyy! Hahaha..\n",
