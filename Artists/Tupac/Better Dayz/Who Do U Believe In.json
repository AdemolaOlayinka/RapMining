    "lyrics": "Let us pray\nHeavenly Father, hear a nigga down here\nBefore I go to sleep\nTell me, who do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\n\n\nI see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin\nPlus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why\nWatchin our own downfall, witness the end\nIt's like we don't believe in God cause we livin in sin\nI asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed\nPointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast\nIt's just another murder, nobody mourns no more\nMy tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin for\nIs it the miniature caskets, little babies\nVictims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy\nMaybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was\nCrack came and it was strange how it rocked us\nPerhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide\nIt's when we ride on our own kind\nWhat is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror\nWe can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer\n\n\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?\n\n\nCan't close my eyes cause all I see is terror\nI hate the man in the mirror\nCause his reflection makes the pain turn realer\nTimes of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts\nIn this society where only gettin the cash counts\nI started out as a beginner\nEntered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner\nI make my money and vacate, evade prison\nWent from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven\nAnd all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside\nYou know, it's like I'm livin just to die\nI fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if I'm worthy\nLivin life thinkin no man can hurt me\nSo I'm askin -- before I lay me down to sleep\nBefore you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery\nI rose up from the slums, made it out the flames\nIn my search for fame will I change? I'm askin\n\n\n\n\nFaith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic\nCause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets\nWith they chest plates stretched like elastic\nAnd what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin\nHeard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block\nJust came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck\nwith a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize\nIf you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked\nTalk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard\nOne of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him\nHe said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure\nCause he just came home off of bail\n\nNow tell me\n\n\n\n\nWho do you believe in?\nIs it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?\nIs it Jesus? Is it God? Or is just yourself?\nDefinately not to be imposed, being a demon\nBecause this is the joy of believing!\nMen, to believe in yourselves\nBut for sure, the higher power\nResides only to ride in the heart of the true\nFrom the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi\nIn the poetry, or in it's realm\nThat's what pulls all words together\nJust to understand, that every man, is his OWN man\nAnd only man can satisfy the man\nOnly the soul of the man, the feelings of the man\nThe for realness of the man\nYou can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man\nAnd you gotta call yourself because you are that man\n\n\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin\n\n\nWho do you believe in? Put my faith in God, and\nBlessed and still breathin\n\n\nEven though it's hard (Who do you believe in?)\nThat's who I believe in (Put my faith in God)\nBefore I'm leavin (Even though it's hard)\nI'm askin the grievin\n(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)\nWho do you believe in? (Who do you believe in?)\nWho do you (Blessed and still breathin)\nOh blessed, oh blessed\n(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)\n\n\nOh who do you\nDo you believe in\nHohhhhh-ohhhhh\n\n\nWho do you believe in?\nI put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin\nAnd even though it's hard, that's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?\n\n\nI'm askin (Who do you believe in?)\nI'm askin you (Put my faith in God)\n(That's who I believe in)\n(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)\n\n\nWho do you believe in?\nI'm blessed and still breathin\nThat's who I believe in\nBefore I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin\nWho do you believe in?\nWho do you believe in?\n",
