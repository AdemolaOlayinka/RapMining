Swear I'll never call you bitch again\nYou ain't fuck with me, hehehe\nI swear I'll never call you bitch again\n(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin apologized)\nI swear I'll never call you bitch again\n(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)\nI'll never call you bitch again\n\n\nDamn - gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence\nI try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent\nI get to thinkin bout this shit, we been through\nWe close like kin but you remain my friend to\nThis life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble\nBut you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you\nReminiscin needin tissues, fightin over childish issues\nSwear I can't live witchu but withouchu every day I miss you\nWhen we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich\nYou always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin witchu\nThough not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes\nTo be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free\nI see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind\nI promise that I'll change in time\nIt's a complicated world, so girl just be a friend\nI swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)\n\n\nWe came.. too far..\nto throw it all away\n(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)\nWe came.. way too far pretty baby\nto throw it all away, throw it all away\n(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, heyyy)\n\n\nI wake up early in the mornin, at the crack of dawn\nNigga still tired so I'm yawnin, and now I'm gone\nTryin to get my money on strong, so an early riser\nOut befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time\nCan't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me\nPlus we been beefin with the East coast, with casualites\nGot stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me\nBut while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me\nMy enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin\nAin't no love for player haters where you cowards goin\nYou paid bail, got me out of jail, home again\nI promise not to leave you on your own again\nCristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped\nIt's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top\nI found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend\nI swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me\n\n\n\n\nI know, I know\nAll that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..\nI know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time\nto grow up y'knahmsayin? That was way back then\n\n\nYou're my nigga, my best friend\nNever gonna call you, a bitch again\nYea yea yea\nOhhhhhhhhhh\n\n\nWitness the evil men do, all this shit I been through\nNever meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?\nI know you been feelin pain, things are not the same\n\"Waitin to Exhale\" while I'm sittin in the county jail\nKeep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better\nMy cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter\nTold 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled\nSorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel\nWho can I trust and if I bust will she snitch\nEven though you ain't the type to trip\nSorry if I called you bitch\nYou showed me the definition of feminine\nThe difference between a pack of bitches and black women\nI see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon\nPictures of us kissin in the living room, in the nude\nThanks for bein there, much more than a friend\nI swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me\n",
