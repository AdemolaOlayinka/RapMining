    "lyrics": "God has a plan, and the Bible unfolds that wonderful plan through the message of prophecy\nGod sent Jesus into this world to be our savior and that Christ is returning someday soon To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity\nFor my life and your life\nAs long as we're cooperating with God by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days\nWe'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy\n\n2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!\nMakaveli, the new breed\nAnd I remember what my pops told me\nThe new word, follow me\nRemember what my pops told me\n\nMy family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers\nStrugglin', known to hustle screaming, \"Fuck they feelings!\"\nI got advice from my father, all he told me was this\nNigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!\nThere's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two\nKnow niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do\nNow, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.\nThat's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy\nNow rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies\nKeep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies\nIt seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled\nPicture jewels being handed to an innocent child\nI never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules\nInitiated as an outlaw, studying rules\nNow papa ain't around, so I gotta recall\nOr come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls\nPromised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right\nDear Lord, don't let me die tonight\nI got words for my comrades, listen and learn\nAin't nothing free, get back what you earned\nNo doubt, getting higher than a motherfucker, bless me please\nThis Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah\nAnd I remember what my papa told me\nRemember what my papa told me, blasphemy\n\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\n(Remember what my pops told me)\nUsing the name of the lord in vain (blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)\n(Remember what my pops told me)\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\n\nWe probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowing\nEverybody kissing ass to go to Heaven ain't going\nPut my soul on it, I'm fighting devil niggas daily\nPlus the media be crucifying brothers severely\nTell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin\nWe got evicted had to leave the 'burbs, back in the ghetto\nDoing wild shit, looking at the sun, don't pay\nCriminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day\nThey say Moses split the Red Sea\nI split the blunt and rolled a fat one up deadly\nBabylon beware, coming for the Pharoah's kids\nRetaliation, making legends off the shit we did\nStill bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waiting for signs\nGod coming, she's just taking her time (haha)\nLiving by the Nile while the water flow\nI'm contemplating plots wondering where the thought'll go\nBrothas getting shot, coming back resurrected\nIt's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)\nAnd I remember what my papa told me\nRemember what my papa told me, blasphemy\n\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\n(Remember what my pops told me)\nUsing the name of the lord in vain\n(Remember what my pops told me)\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\n(what!)\n\nThe preacher want me buried, why? Cause I know he a liar\nHave you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire\nWhy you got these kids' minds thinking that they evil?\nWhile the preacher being freaky you say \"honor God's people\"\nShould we cry when the Pope die? My request\nWe should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X\nMama, tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop?\nWaiting to beat my ass if I don't go pop?\nMemories of a past time, giving up cash to the leaders\nKnowing damn well they ain't gonna feed us\nIn my brain how can you explain time in B.C\nIt's hard enough to live now in these times of greed\nThey say Jesus is a kind man\nWell, he should understand times in this crime land\nMy Thug nation, do what you gotta do, but know you gotta change. Try to find a way to make it out the game\nI leave this, and hope God can see my heart is pure\nIs heaven just another door? I leave this here\nI leave this, and hope God see my heart is pure\nIs Heaven just another door? And my people say\u2026\n\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\n(Remember what my pops told me)\nUsing the name of the lord in vain\n(Can't I remember what my pops told me, blasphemy)\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\nUsing the name of the lord in vain\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\nUsing the name of the lord in vain\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\nLove for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord\nDem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud\nUsing the name of the lord in vain\nWhile de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain\nOur father, who art in heaven\nHallow be thy name\nThy kingdom come, thy will be done\nIn Earth as it is in Heaven\nGive us this day, our daily bread\nAs we give up our debts\nAs we forgive our debt-ors\nLead us not into temptation\nBut deliver us unevil\nFor God is the kingdom and the power\nAnd the glory forever and ever and ever\n",
