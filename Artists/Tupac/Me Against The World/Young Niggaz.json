(Go to school nigga, go to school)\nFuck around and, you pimpin' out here\nYou could be a lawyer (really doe)\nNiggas gotta get they priorities straight\n(Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker)\nReally doe. Young Niggas. little RahRah\n(sup nigga) Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy\n(Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, Young Niggas)\n",
