    "lyrics": "Death Row\nThat's where motherfuckers is endin up\n\nDear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness\nI robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness\nWonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch\nShould I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?\nDon't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped\nHawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back\nI'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it\nCause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it\nGot no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me\nToo fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me\nNiggaz gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash\nWhip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass\nPeter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk\nSnatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk\nThe punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice\nBefore I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics\nI listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane\nI guess the little, mites had finally found his brain\nNew Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen\nRemember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend\nIt's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers\nAnd fuck five-oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty-niners\n\n\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin like a thief, runnin through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go...\nWhere they find me? 16 on Death Row\n\nDear mama, these cops don't understand me\nI turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family\nMy uncle used to touch me, I never told you that\nScared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back\nI kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger\nI'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger\nThe brother in my cell, is 16 as well\nIt's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell\nI shouldn'ta let him catch me\nInstead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy\nAnd my cellmate's raped on the norm\nAnd passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn\nThey made me an animal\nCan't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggaz countin cannibals\nAnd that's how it is in the pen\nTurn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend\nMy mama prayed for me\nTell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)\nCause when they come for me they find a struggler\nTo the death I take the breath from your jugular\nThe trick is to never lose hope\nI found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row\n\n\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin like a thief, runnin through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go...\nWhere you find me? 16 on Death Row\n\nDear mama, they sentenced me to death\nToday's my final day, I'm countin every breath\nI'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen\nI know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16\nI got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit\nAnd they too quick to say goodbye to me\nThey tell me the preacher's there for me\nHe's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me\nHe's only here to be sure\nI don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin\non the poor, and how can these people judge me?\nThey ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me\nI never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan\nto keep a nigga in the state pen\nAnd to my homies out buryin motherfuckers\nSteer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers\nCause once they got you locked up\nThey got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up\nI'm convinced self-defense is the way\nPlease, stay strapped, pack a gat every day\nI wish I woulda known while I was out there\nNow I'm straight headin for the chair\n\n\nBye bye, I was never meant to live\nCan't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live\nBye bye, I was never meant to be\nLivin like a thief, runnin through the streets\nBye bye, and I got no place to go...\nWhere you find me? 16 on Death Row\n\n16 on Death Row\nIt's to all my partners in the penitentiaries\n16 on Death Row\n",
