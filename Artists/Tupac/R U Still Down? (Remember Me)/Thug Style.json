A nigga livin' life like a G\nIn that artillery keepin' niggas off of me\nI can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep\nNiggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat\nYou can holler if you want to, please!\nI ain't runnin' with no punk crew be, bleed!\nEnemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone\nMy fuckin' game is strong, now hotline\nYou suckas better find ya mind I got mine\nFrom hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes\nTo my niggas up in Quentin, Down on Rikers Isle\nStay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style\nI could be wrong but I never got along with cops\nIt's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks\nAnd all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends\nI'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)\nMy fake friends say they love me but I know they lie\nCause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide\nMy mama cried when they took me off to jail\nOnly me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell\nI hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside\nWill 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive\nI cry, but in my own way swallow my pride\nPick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die\nCemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down\nEven now I wonder will I still be around\nMy hometown is the gutter I was born a wild\nI came up out this dust with my heartless style\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style\nI remember Uptown, run catch a kiss\nListenin' to Mr. Magic\nCuttin' up the hits And even though I had a habit\nMakin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness\nJuvenile thugs come on\nI tell the whole story nothin' but truth\nHalloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs\nAnd Pete and Lee young G's with a gift of gab\nTryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab Remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'\nAnd tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'\nAnd jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'\nCall the cuties cuss words but we only playin'\nI'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck\nI had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck\nI had family but I was way too wild\nHad to move to the West to regain my style\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)\nNiggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (my nigga scream)\nNiggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)\nNiggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)\nNiggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the cross, but my force was wild\nBitch-made ass niggas don't know my style\nThese, niggas don't know my style\nQuick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child\nTry to put me in the mothafuckin' cross, but my force was wild\nMothafuckin' bitches\nSwear y'all know nigga\nEver heard motherfucka say all in Kool-Aid know the flavor hahha\nYou mothafuckas all about my motherfuckin' hell being though\nThis shit thuggish, fo' life, I told y'all, it's album three see\nG sound, freestyle\nMotherfuckin' Young Thugs in this motherfucker\n",
