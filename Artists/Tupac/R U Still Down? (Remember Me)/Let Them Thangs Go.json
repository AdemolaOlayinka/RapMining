Double up nigga it's on\nThe type of nigga that likes to bone with the lights on\nIf ya ready for a nigga hit me (Hooooooo!)\nStop fronting motherfucker let them thangs go\nYes some of you niggas are bitches too\nLittle square motherfuckers trying to get to who?\nPop pop never made it to ya punk ass clique\nTalk shit now ya gotta get ya punk ass whipped\nFor the bitches that be trying to work a nigga (fuck that bitch)\nFor the tramps that be trying to jerk a nigga (fuck that tric)\nFor the rollers that be trying to urk a nigga (fuck the cops)\nI'ma hustle and you punks can't hurt me nigga\nIf ya ready for a nigga hit me (Hooooooo!)\nStop fronting motherfucker let them thangs go\nuh, uh, yeah\nLet them thangs go\n",
