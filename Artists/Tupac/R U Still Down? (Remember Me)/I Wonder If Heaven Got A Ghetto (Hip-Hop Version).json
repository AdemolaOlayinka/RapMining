    "lyrics": "I was raised, the little young nigga doin bad shit\nTalk much shit cause I never had shit\nI could remember being whupped in class\nAnd if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass\nWas it my fault papa didn't plan it out\nBroke out left me to be the man of the house\nI couldn't take it, had to make a profit\nDown the block, got a glock, and I clock grip\nMakin G's was my mission\nMovin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and\nwhy must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller\nFirst you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now\nIf you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down\nGod damn it's a motherfuckin riot\nBlack people only hate police so don't try it\nIf you're not from the town then don't pass through\nCause some O.G. fools might blast you\nIt ain't right but it's long overdue\nWe can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too\nI want G's so you label me a criminal\nAnd if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto\n\n\n\n\n\nHere on Earth, tell me what's a blick life worth\nA bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts\nAnd even when you take the shit\nMove counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit\nAsk Rodney, LaTasha, and many more\nIt's been goin on for years, there's plenty more\nWhen they ask me, when will the violence cease?\nWhen your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street\nNiggaz had enough time to make a difference\nBear witness, own our own business\nWord to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet\nFirst we couldn't afford shit now everything's free\nso we loot, please don't shoot when you see\nI'm takin from the, cause for years they would take it from me\nNow the tables have turned around\nYou didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down\nAnd now Bush can't stop the hit\nPredicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse\nAnd for once I was down with niggaz, felt good\nin the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah\nAnd for the first time everybody let go\nAnd the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto\n\n\n\n\n\nI see no changes, all I see is racist faces\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races\nWe under I wonder what it take to make this\none better place, let's erase the wait state\nTake the evil out the people they'll be acting right\nCause both black and white are smokin crack tonight\nAnd only time we deal is when we kill each other\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other\nAnd though it seems heaven-sent\nWe ain't ready, to have a black President, huh\nIt ain't a secret don't conceal the fact\nThe penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks\nI wake up in the morning and I ask myself\nIs life worth living should I blast myself\nI'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black\nMy stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch\nCops give a damn about a ne-gro\nPull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero\nMo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz\nI'd rather be dead than a po' nigga\nLet the Lord judge the criminals\nIf I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto\n\n\n\nJust think, if niggaz decide to retaliate\n(Soldier in the house)\nI wonder if heaven got a ghetto\n",
