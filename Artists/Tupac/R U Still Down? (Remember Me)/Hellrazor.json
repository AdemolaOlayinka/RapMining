Hell motherfuckin' yeah\nThis one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah\nMama raised a hellraiser\nBorn thuggin'\nHeartless and mean, muggin at sixteen\nOn the scene watchin' fiends buggin\nKickin up dust with the older G's\nSoakin up the game that was told to me\nI ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot\nI learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes\nTaught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions\nWhile other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexin'\nElementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it\nI'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing\nI'm buckin blastin, straight mashin\nMobbin through the overpass laughin\nWhile these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt\nThey jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord\nCan ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger\nCause some nigga tried to kill me\nAnd mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin paid\nPolice on my pager, straight stressin\nA fugitive my occupation is under question\nWanted for investigation, and even though\nI'm marked for death, I'mma spark til I lose my breath\nMotherfuckers, every time I see the paper\nI see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer\nThey come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap\nAnd they wonder why it's hard bein black\nDear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser\nStress gettin' major, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nDear Lord can ya feel me\nTell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign\nDamn near running outta time, everybody's dyin\nMama raised a hellraiser, can't figure\nWhy you let the police beat down niggas\nI'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe\nWhile the po' babies rushin' into early graves\nGod come save the youth\nAin't nothin else to do but have faith in you\nDear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand\nForgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand\nAnd my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic\ncrooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord\nCan ya feel me? Show a way\nI'm prayin but my enemies won't go away\nAnd everywhere I turn I see niggas burn\nEvery nigga that I know's on death row\nMy younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price\nLittle young motherfucker doin triple life\nThough I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better\nIf my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof\nJust heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama\nWanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts\nGettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin\n'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'\nMama raised a hellraiser, uh, yeah\nC'mon, uh, mama raised a hellraiser\nUh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major\n(Lord be my savior, unnh)\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nLord be my savior, unnh\nMama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major\nDear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me\nA young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets\nI'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME\nTHE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!\nI got my three-five-seven can't control it\nScreamin die motherfucker and he's loaded\nEverybody run for cover, aww shit\nThug Life motherfucker, duck quick\nNow am I wrong if I am don't worry me\nCause do or die gettin high till they bury me\nDear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why\nLittle girl like LaTasha, had to die\nShe never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot\nHer little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped\nAnd when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha\nNow I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end\nit's my friends, that flip-flop\nLip-locked on my dick when my shit drop\nThug Life motherfucker, I lick shots\nEvery nigga on my block dropped two cops\nDear Lord can ya hear me, when I die\nLet a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high\nwith my hands on the trigger, Thug nigga\nStressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer\nAnd even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life\nI got the heart to fight now\nMama raised a hellraiser why cry\nThat's just life in the ghetto, do or die\n",
