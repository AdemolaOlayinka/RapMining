    "lyrics": "Are you still down?\nNow up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong\nAnd mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born\nI came up, out the gutter never changed my style\nGot for real about my papers, cause the game was wild\nAnd the fame was a plot to try to change me\nAnd what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came\nNow the whole world is calling me a killer\nAll I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real\nAll the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'\nCouldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in\nShit's gettin' sleazy, believe me\nBest to take what ya need, but don't be greedy\nCause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought\nI didn't have to run, now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' \"One time!\"\nTake your time to feel my record\nAnd if you did, chill a second\nMy blind method, will still wreck it\nMy young homies stay strong\nI wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone\nAre you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nI'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky\nTurn tough inside, in the rush to die\nLivin' life as a thug, time to face the truth\nWhat's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God\nCome and save me, had to work with what ya gave me\nAnd got a nigga goin' crazy\nI can't read the signs\nI'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine\nCause times, they ain't what they used to be\nAin't a penitentiary built big enough for me\nAnd my niggas on the streets, man, listen\nCause these ain't the old days\nAin't no way, I'mma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay\nIt seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid\nI seen the future and it's hopeless\nLord knows, it's hard on a young scrub\nIt seems I had less problems when I slung drugs\nBut since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game\nWanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name\nAnd them same motherfuckers that was callin' me\nWill be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see\nI should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear\nThis one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nRaise 'em up ... are you still down?\nI wrote this for my critics and my enemies\nLast year ya used to love me, huh, remember me\nNow ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix\nI'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks\nAnd now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail\nJust as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell\nAnd I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped\nAnd mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me\nRan outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me\nMy daddy left me alone and so I'm angry\nI never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, \"Baby, it's on!\"\nAnd now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones\nNever said it came easy, I'm makin' cheese\nBuyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed\nWish my homeboys could see me now\nLittle bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town\nPlease tell me, are you still down?\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up?\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up?\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up? Remember me\nAre you still down, to raise 'em up?\nThat's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger\nRaise 'em up\nThese hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?\nThug life niggas be the sickest\nYou feel me?\nNow get that shit written down\nGod damn!\nTook four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me\nAin't that a bitch?\nAre you still motherfuckin' down?\nOld ho ass fake ass niggas\nWe out this motherfucker though\n",
