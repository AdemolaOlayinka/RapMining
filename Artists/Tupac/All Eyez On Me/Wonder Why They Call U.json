'Cause everybody left\nThey stepped, and left you on your own\nSee, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick\nAnd that's why we called you bitch\u2014I betcha!\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\u2014I betcha, bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\u2014I betcha, bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\u2014I betcha, bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\nYou wonda why they call you bitch\nDear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me\nFuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind\nI figured you wanted to know\nYou know, why we call them hoes bitches\nAnd maybe this might help you understand\nIt ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business\nSo If you wonder why we call you bitch\nYou wonder why we call you bitch\nIf you wonder why we call you bitch\nYou wonder why we call you bitch\n",
