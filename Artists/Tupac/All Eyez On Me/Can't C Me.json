It ain't nothing but a party when we thug\nAnd there I was, a young nigga with heart\nAin't had shit to lose\nPullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules\nD-R-E you got me heated\nMy words like a penitentiary dick\nHitting bitches where it's most needed\nMoney and weed, Alize and Hennessy\nTo my thug niggas in lock down: witness me\nBail on these hoes in floss-mode\nThe life of a boss playa, fuck what you thought, though\nMy enemies deceased, die like a bitch\nWhen my album hit the streets, niggas can't see me!\n\n(Niggas can't see me)\n(They can't see me)\nWhich way did he go, George?\nWhich way did he go?\nOh!! which way did he go?\nWhich way did he go?\n\nYou niggas made a mistake\nYou should've never put my rhymes with Dre\nThem Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day\nHey homie, if you feel me\nTell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't killed me\nI can make a motherfucker shake, rattle n' roll\nI'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes\nAnd I can make you jealous niggas famous\nFuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is\nI'm just a rich motherfucker from the way\nIf this rapping bring me money, then I'm rapping 'til I'm paid\nI'm getting green like I'm supposed to\nNigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through\nLook to the star, and visualize my debut\nNiggas know me, player, I gotta stay true\nDon't be a dumb motherfucker cause it's crazy after dark\nWhere the true thug-niggas see your heart\nNiggas can't see me!\nYo, check this out: stay off his dick\n\n(Niggas can't see me)\nRight before your eyes, I'll disappear from here\nYou niggas can't see me\nYou can't see me\n(I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face)\n(But you still can't see me)\nYou can't see me\n(All up in your range, but niggas can't see me)\n20/20 vision won't visualize\n(I'm in the flesh baby, but you can't see me)\nAll those glasses won't help you realize\n(You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me)\nYou can't see me\n(Thug Life, baby)\n(Don't believe everything you read!)\n(Alize and weed)\nYou can't see me, right before your very eyes\nYou won't even visualize, you can't see me\n(Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac)\nNiggas can't see me\n(I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!\n(This one's for you, BIG baby)\n(Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me)\n(Niggas can't see me)\nYou can't see me\nSee no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil\nYou won't see me\nYeah, first see me, now you don't\nWanna see me, but you won't\nCome to see me, but you can't\nOh, you can't see me, you can't see me\nRight between your eyes and you'll never realize\nRight before your eyes, you won't even realize\nVisualize what you can't see\n",
