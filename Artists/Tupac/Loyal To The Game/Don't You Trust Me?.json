    "lyrics": "I ain't got time for this man I'm out\n\nYou should stop for awhile you will find me standing by (Don't you trust me?)\nOver here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)\nYou spend all your hours just rushing around\nDo you have a little time to have a little time for me?\nAs soon as I leave the house you wanna page me\nSee you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery\nYou act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better\nAnd maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters\nSoon as I come home it's like I get the third degree\nWhere ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe\nIt makes me wanna leave\nI'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve\nYour suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me\nIf you really trust me then it's pitiful\nQuestion me about my whereabouts that's so trivial\nLet me live my life and you can live yours\nJust be there to help me and support that's what your here for\nNot to give me stress and add to pressure\nHome is where I go the rest I go to pass the test\nI'm sorry if I left you all alone\nBut I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone\nDon't you trust me?\n\nCallin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense\nTell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends\nIt's time for us to take our separate paths\nWe had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass\nLet's make it an even break don't make it scandalous\nTry to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this\nYou're saying I'm too busy I ignore you\nI guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you\nBut now it seems the arguments are nightly\nI wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me\nSo why let it stress and aggravate me\nInstead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me\nYou tell me that you love me but your lyin'\nFighting back the urge to start cryin'\nI wipe away your tears come and hug me\nI love you like you love me\nGirl... don't you trust me?\n\nI hangup the phone\nI can't bare to hear you yellin' at me\nMaybe we should end it neither one of us are happy\nYou know that I'm emotional you milk me\nComin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty\nYou and me were met to be it yet\nYou always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)\nJust let me pack my things and I'll be outie\nThis time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me\nI can't take the beefin' and the griefin'\nI get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'\nMaybe next time you'll be a little more sure\nWhen I can give you more when you mature\nBut baby until then I gotta leave ya\nIt's not that I don't need ya but see ya\nAnd I hope that you understand why I bust it\nNot because we rushed it (hell no)\nBut girl don't you trust me?\n\nNot that I don't trust you\nDon't you trust me?\nNot that I don't trust you\nDon't you trust me?\nNot that I don't trust you\n",
