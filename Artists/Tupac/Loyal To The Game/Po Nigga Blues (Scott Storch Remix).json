Cuz I had to\nA nigga gotta pay the fuckin bills\n\n\n\nCrazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me\nThey got me trapped in this slavery\nnow I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G\nI told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin \"fuck the law\"\nAnd if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record\nWhats a nigga gotta do to get respected\nSometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say \"yes\" a nigga quick to get arrested\nThat's the reason I stay zestin(??), I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting\nrestless\nWalkin round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts\nBuck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust\nThey make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer\nNow them same mother fuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me\nI need loot, so I'm doin what I do, and don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes,\nTheres no other destiny to choose, I had nothing left to lose, so I'm singin the po nigga blues\n\n\n\n\n\nCoppin these brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do, my little boy gotta eat too\nSo why must I sock a fella? Just live large like rocafella\nAnd did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war but I aint old enough to drink\nCops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my \"I don't give a fuck\" look\nMakin rules, I'ma break em, no matter how much you make em, show me bakin, I'ma take em\nSo don't you ever temp me, I'm a fool for mine nigga, and my pockets stay empty\nTo my brother in the barrio, you livin worse then the niggas in ghetto so\nI give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section\nYou got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me\nWe aint free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch\nDown with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch\nAnd a nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone(huh)\nAnd you wonder why we blazin niggas, cuz you punks haven babies cant raise the niggas\nAnd they damned to be fuck ups too, drink 40s of brew, singin the nigga blues\n\n\n\nWhy'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to\nWhy'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to\nWhy'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to\nAnd now I'm headin for the mother fuck in PEN\n",
