(?).. all the down ass riders\nAll the niggaz that put it down, all the soldiers\nAll the niggaz that go through that day to day struggled\nThis is the ballad of a dead soldier!\nAll the niggaz that passed on\nAll the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart\nAll the niggaz that want some and that don't take none\nHahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!\nThe police are so scared of us\nAll the feds they aware of us\nThey wanna see us dead\nThey got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!\nTryin to see me in chains, shit\nThem niggaz'll never breathe again\nBefore they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell\nCause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!\nGot my pistols cocked\nRun the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!\nThe police? We run these streets nigga\nAin't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!\nThese niggaz can't see me, half the world wanna be me\nMulti-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair\nBut nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier!\n",
