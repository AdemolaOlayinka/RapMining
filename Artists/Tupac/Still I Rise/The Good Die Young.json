Brown\nCoulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud\nFamily grievin' on your last breath\nClose to the heart whether you know it or not\nI swear the love won't stop\nJewel, that's my boo\nMom, Duke and Lou\nFrom jump\nYou kept it true, helped to feed the crew\nThe good die young\nLivin' fast jumpin' the gun\nMama blamin' the community for killin' her son\nMy cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'\nBut never knowin' he was dyin' slower\nI guess I see ya when I see ya soulja\n\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n\nI know my life ain't promised\nThat's why the wise move in silence\nAnalize these scandalous times\nIt's hard dogg but we manage\nSchools turn to war zones\nEven homes unsafe\nLeavin' children to play caged and raged\nThey hate, how come\nSomeone explain why the good die young\nWhy the bad die slow and outlive everyone\nIt's time somethin' is done\nFor our young kids\nThey growin' opus (??)\nThat ain't the way to live\nTell me why\n\nDays go past and as they pa*s\nTime move quicker\nNo time for wastin'\nPut your hustle down my young dealers\nCause the end is nearer\nBut at least that's what they tellin' me\nHell, all I know brothers\nAin't ridin' 4 3 felonys\nIt's time to plan, plot, and strategize\nCapitolize, mobilize\nWe in the war y'all\nIt's for all y'all\nMy family to the ones that stabbed (?) me\nLittle bit mo' love is what's recommended\nYeah, and it's plain to see\nThe seeds from you and me\nGon' be the ones to lead us towards unity\nThat's if we treat them right\nMan, teach them right\nRaise your kids better than you was\nAnd see what it does\nBut if you don't\nMan, we sho' to be done\nWe'll all see exactly why the good die young\n\nDoes anybody have an answer why\nIt seems the good die young\nCan anybody tell me why\nCan anybody tell me why\n\n\nThis is for all my homeboys that pa*sed away\nAnd all yo' homeboys that pa*sed away\nI send this out to all the fallen soldiers\nThat's in the cemetaries buried\nNever got to see they dreams\nFor everything I touch you touch\nFor every step I take you take\nFor every breath I breather you breathe\nEvery dollar I make you make\nI told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day\nYou just got there a little quicker\nBut like my homeboys Thugs say\nI'll catch ya at the crossroads\nThe good die young\n\nThis song is dedicated to all them\nYoung kids and people that are innocent\nThat died young\nAt Columbine High\nRest in Peace (Oklahoma)\nOutlawz\nLil' young Xzandafer\nTasha, all them\nAll the fallen kids\nThe dead babies\nThe closed caskets\n",
