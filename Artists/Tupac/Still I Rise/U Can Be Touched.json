Yak.. die in the struggle in my eyes\nSo I know anybody can be touched\nYou know what I mean?\n\n\nOh God forgive me\nSomebody please say a prayer for me\nNeeded my parents\nBut they was never there for me\nBelieve in everything they feed me\nI'm seeing demons\nI wake up screaming\nWho believe me or was I dreaming?\nFive fingers on the .45 chrome\nDead aim at my brain, infared with no lights on\nI ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this\nI'm living blind writing rhymes\nTil they capture this\nAnd if we die let the world understand why\nSoldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry\nThey seeing us inside a casket\nThat's how they see us\nOh God forgive us ghetto bastards\nWe human beings\nThey leaving us inside this hell-hole\nJust waiting to fail so they tell us\nThat's what jail for\nAdolescense young teens turned violent\nIt's floating, in a world turned silent\nCause you could be touched\n\n\nYoung ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n\nYoung ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n\n\nI live life High Speed\nMoving a million miles per hour\nTowards my destiny\nMaking decesions carelessly\nYeah it's me, yo ni**a man child\nBomb first stand proud\nAin't looking for hand-outs\nTwenty-five years up in this bi**h\nAnd I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich\nAnd leave my kids a grip\nI let my blood drip off in this thug s**t\nYou can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission\nLike right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock\nTry to get mo' so my s**t don't flock\nI lick off shots for everything they owe me\nAnd when it's my time to go\nI pray the Lord hold me\n(U can be touched)\n\n\nI was born in the city that never sleeps\nSchooled by the realest of the real ni**az\nThat ever breathed\nAnd I was big when I was young\nAnd now I see that I was dumb\nMy ni**a.. Lonnie just got hit with 10... 10 years\nFor trusting a friend\nThey left him stuck in the Penn\nI love him, we all here just to die here, plus\nNobody cares what got here\nTouched by a angel and kissed by the Lord\nPraise the thug ways and I'll never be bored\nTouched by a angel and kissed by the Lord\nY'all praise the thug ways\nSo forever it's on.. baby\n\n\nMy Young ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n\nYoung ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n\n\nWhy grieve this life\nPlanted by the fiends and pipes\nGreen lights so\nI'm seeing-seeing everything twice\nPretty much of nothing nice\n(naw) we sucking it up\nEven when we get a job, we f**king it up\nLike it can't happen to us\nI could never be a bum\nYeah right, you wound up one\nGod forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up\nLook and learn\nNext it could be your turn... word\n\n\nYes this a felonies' hobby\nThat got me here thinking robbery\nDay to day all year long\nTeflon protects my body\nIt's such unimportant in this criminal cartel\nI'm caught and supporting me\nSo in these streets of hockey\nI play the goalie,\nSecretz to war licks, and score s**t\nShare between clients and homies\nRemember what Patcino told me\nBefore he past\nWatch them clowns with them crocodile smiles\nCause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely\nAnd I'm point like a thong\nAnd it's survive for the strong\nLiving outside the laws of this crooked world\nI was born touched\n\n\nMy Young ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n\nYoung ni**az in the wild life\nCriminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life\nThinking he can make his pay\nToo in a rush, ni**az better slow down\nCause you can be touched\n",
