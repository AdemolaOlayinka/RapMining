Tupac
Still I Rise
1999)
Yo, I can see 
That you obviously don't know me or my homies
We O-U-T Lawz, f**k the phonies
A wise hustler once told me, it's on you
Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain exstend
ni**as ain't worth s**t
Cops and ride d**k permits
I heard this and heard that 
About them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off
f**k yall now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a ni**a name 
But never said what up
That s**t critical, dispicable, unforgiveable
I too like Hot ??
Your own fan won't remember you
Thuggin but we still spriutual, clear lyrical
I'm like the f**kin Deff Squad 
My ears ain't hearin' yall
Pump fearin' yall
But damn I ain't even wantin' to scare yall
Listen to what I tell yall
f**k the world, 
Your baby moms and your baby girl
You muthaf**kas so fake, 
Yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin the degree
Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate thug ni**az


We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us


Now I been trapped down 
And f**ked since day one
This industructional style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from
You sure to see about 10 ni**az in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life 
Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical
Then one of them sat down living so 
Mystikal and empoious
With a heart full of anger it's so redicilous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the d**k to your wife 
And I'm the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that? respect this
I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 
We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that estacy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed
I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me


We will never fall
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers


When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this chedder
ni**az is laying deader 
Then Malcom and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what Pac said
Watch the f**kin signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin off his shine
Now one time for my muthaf**kin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro 
May we all roll
And if you don't know 
We got the rap game petro
Scared cause we bout to release 
Like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground 
We running the ghettos
Stealing all of ya fan base like we kleptos
bi**h I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And ni**az is stealing my s**t 
And busting it wrong
Hot shots holla back when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin back at the system
Military wisdom
Preparing myself for armegeddom
Breaking my balls at this game
Knowing it's a dead end
And my only weapon 
Is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah we the muthaf**kas 
That you ni**az is liery off
Controling my steam
Knowing my team to deserve more
f**k the reframe
Stick to the game and earn more
Holding my head, rolling the head with focus
Laughing inside
Cause deep inside y'all don't know us


We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us

We will never fall (Never)
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us


Ain't never know ni**az like us boy
They don't make ni**az like us no more
Thug in Peace.. to all my ni**az (Never)
See ya soon.. uhh
