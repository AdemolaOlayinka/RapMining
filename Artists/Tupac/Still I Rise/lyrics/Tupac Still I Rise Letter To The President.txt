Tupac
Still I Rise
1999)
Uhh.. dear Mr. President
Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, s**t is still real f**ked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true


Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
ni**az fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause I'm seldom in the company of bi**hes
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or bi**h, inside the s**t I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in ma*s amounts, brothers keep countin
f**k the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, ni**a what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
but then America f**ked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard s**t
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ?ride for M'Thulu? like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops


Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a ni**a flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same ni**a
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'f**kers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherf**kin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherf**ker

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops


Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, ni**az lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a ni**a you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President

s**t is still f**ked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better


Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up..

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug ni**a
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bi**h ain't never did s**t for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a ni**a on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President


Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Word motherf**kin life
f**k this ni**a think?Cuttin taxes, takin off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin?
Motherf**kers crazier than a motherf**kin ??
ni**a this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz ni**a
We fin' to hustle til we come up

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Dear Mr. Clinton, s**t
It's gettin harder and harder for a motherf**ker
to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean s**t, I hear you screamin peace
But we can't find peace
til my little ni**az on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a ni**a out?Sayin you cuttin welfare
That got us ni**az on the street, thinkin who in the hell care?
s**t, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
but y'all ain't ready to give us no motherf**kin dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young ni**az into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the f**k I'm fightin for?
s**t, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
police beatin me in the streets
f**k peace

These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
