I know it's hard out there, heheh\nwith teardrops and closed caskets\nIt's like that's all we got to look forward to these days\nMurders, brothers dyin, funerals\nWill I.. forever be alone\ns**t, it's like I done ran out of suits homey\nI done ran out of tears\nKnow we gon' have to do somethin y'all\nWe gon' have to do somethin\nWill I.. forever be alone\nCause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing\n(rest in peace)\nTeardrops and closed caskets\nI send this out to M'thulu Geronimo\nand to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers\nWill I.. forever be alone\n(to the homey Boonie, rest in peace ni**a)\nAll the homies that fell, all the homies\nMay God bless your families\nMay you always live in the motherf**kin heart\nWill I.. forever be alone\nIn a thug ni**az heart forever\n(that's right)\nRest in peace ni**a\nMay your enemies be deceased, dead on the streets\nWe can't have peace til the ni**az get a piece\nWill I..\n",
