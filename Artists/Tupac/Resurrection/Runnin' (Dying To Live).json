    "lyrics": "Between you and Biggie was like, who's gonna, who's gonna,\nwho ruled, the, the, nigga kingdom and shit basically, you know what I'm sayin'?\nIt was like, this is like an election...\nIt is an election\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nMe and Biggie's situation was smaller than that,\nme and Biggie's situation was like...\n\nTupac Shakur was shot several times in the chest...\n\n\nYou know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead\nWhy am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight\nWhy am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight\nWhy am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try\nWhy am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die\n\n\nCheck it, I grew up a fucking screw up\nGot introduced to the game, got a ounce and fucking blew up\nChopping rocks overnight\nThe nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White\nWe had to grow dreads to change our description\nTwo cops is on the milk box missing\nShow they toes you know they got stepped on\nA fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon\nRun from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat\nI fuck around and catch a asthma attack\nThat's why I bust back, it don't phase me\nWhen he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze\ncelebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight\nLaid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker\n\n\n\n\nAnd still I'm having memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed\nAs I laugh pushing the gas when my glocks blast\nWe was young, and we was dumb but we had heart\nIn the dark when we survived through the bad parts\nMany dreams is what I had, and many wishes\nNo hesitation in extermination of these snitches\nAnd these bitches they still continue to pursue me\nA couple of movies now the whole world trying to screw me\neven the cops tried to sue me\nSo what can I do but stay true, sipping 22's a brewing\nnow the medias trying to test me got the press asking questions, trying to stress me\nmisery is all I see, thats my mind's state\nMy history with the police is shakin' the crime rate\nMa main man had 2 strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped\nHe screamed 'Thug Life!' and emptied the clip\ngots tired of running from the police\n\n\n\n\nI was shocked at everything! Ya know what I'm saying. I wasn't more shocked at him dying.\nI was more shocked at him. Pac' is a strong dude... I know him... You know what I'm sayin?...\nReal strong... so it was when he got shot I was more like \"again\". You know what I'm sayin?...\nHe always getting shot or shot at... He gon' pull threw this one again, make a few of records about it and its gon' be over..\nYou know, then when he died I was like 'Woah'... you know what I'm sayin...\nit kinda took me by suprise... even though we was going threw our drama I would NEVER\nwish death on nobody! 'cause there ain't no coming back from that .....\n",
