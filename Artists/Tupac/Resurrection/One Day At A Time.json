    "lyrics": "Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning\nMind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore\nGot me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming\nCause they seeing destruction before they a see human being\nSo they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day\nUntil we learn to pray, keep our families in shape\nCause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die\nBefore we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns\nSmoking weed, can all make a change\nSo I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,\nI keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,\nCommunities in need of people that will lead\nKeep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try\nUntil the day I die, I promise to be wise\nWith my heart open, greed, brings only misery\nA way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free\nOnly a few chosen, rise (rise)\nMy ghetto queen, rise (rise)\nDon't be afraid to try (try)\nToo many of us died to the door to open wide\nMy brother be wise, stay focused on the prize\nThough everybody dies\nWe can...\n\n\nOnly learn to take, our anger and our hate\nControl our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight\nMaybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes\nFor we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate\nCause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take\nTheres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate\nTo the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes\nYou'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes\nBut we aint\nIts plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays\nAnd a picture that he paints\nBut in the midst of all this anger and this angst\nNever once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear no complaints\nBut I know, that I will always continue to grow,\nAs long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow\nThere will never be another me\nAnd that I can guarantee\nThats why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day\nThe game will never be the same\nNo matter how much fame or success they attain\nThere will never be another me\nAnd no matter what they do\nThere will never be another you\nYou can search but you'll never find\nYou can try to rewind time\nBut in your hearts and your minds\nWe will never die\nWe are forever alive\nAnd we continue growing....\n\n\nOne day at a time\n\nDon't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype\nRappers are regular people minus money and light\nSearching for fortune and fame, and super stardom\nAll the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.\nNow the hip-hop police, the villains is watching\nAnd kids think beef is the only option\nOutlaws born filthy, guilty as charged\nMy memories of Khaddafi, but Makaveli lives on\nYou think the industry is fun\nAnd no pity with guns\nAnd when your money is up\nThats when your enemies come\nSo if he died and came back\nWould he try to save rap?\nWe needing a change, the drama remains\n\nI spent my whole life, fighting myself\nThat I cant win so I'm inviting some help\nand every now and then I take rights from left\nIm still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt\nAnd that there is a fight in itself\nSo I just pray and hope god\nTake a like to myself\nNo matter how much I try (stay alive)\nI'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride\n\nHeard frivolous beats, we past that\nI'm trying to keep some income coming in\nAnd collect on my ass cap\nThe rappers in the game aint changed\nAnd I finally realized that we not in the same game\nThe hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it\nThem 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it\nThe streets is military, you gotta be a soldier\nGotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers\nAs they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us\nSo we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling\nOne way at a time, keep the faith in your mind\nand we continue growin...\n\n\n...One day at a time.
