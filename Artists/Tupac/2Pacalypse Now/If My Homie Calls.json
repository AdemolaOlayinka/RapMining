    "lyrics": "Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee\nWe been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G\nBack in the days we played practical jokes on\nEverybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on\nAll through high school, girls by the dozens\nSaying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't\nBut like the old saying goes\nTimes goes on, and everybody grows\nGrew apart, had to part, went our own ways\nYou chose the dope game, my microphone pays\nIn many ways we were paid in the old days\nSo far away from the crazies with AK's\nAnd though I been around clowning with the Underground\nI'm still down with my homies from the hometown\nAnd if you need, need anything at all\nI drop it all for y'all, if my homies call\n\"If you ever need a place to stay\"\n\"Well, alright, y'all\"\n\"Brothers and sisters\"\nIt's a shame, you chose the dope game\nNow you slang 'caine on the streets with no name\nIt was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine\nYou got game now you run with no shame\nI chose rapping tracks to make stacks\nIn fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats\nBut now I don't wanna down my homie\nNo matter how low you go, you're not lowly\nAnd I, hear that you made a few enemies\nBut when you need a friend you can depend on me, call\nIf you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance\nI'll be there in an instant\nWho am I to judge another brother, only on his cover\nI'd be no different than the other\nH-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E\nI'm down to the E-N-D\n'Cause it's a fall in no time at all\nI'm down for y'all, when my homies call\nWord, if my homies call\n\"If you ever need a place to stay\"\n\"Well, alright, y'all\"\n\"Brothers and sisters\"\nWell, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now\nBut I hear that you're going through some hell, pal\nBut life making records ain't easy\nIt ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy\nBut I guess that the streets is harder\nTrying to survive in the life of a young godfather\nMy homies is making it elsewhere\nStriving, working nine to five with no health care\nWe both had dreams of being great\nBut his deferred and blurred and changed in shape\nIt's fate, it wasn't my choice to make\nTo be great, I'm giving it all it takes\nTrying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes\nI gotta take my place or fall from grace\nThe foolish way, the pace is quick and great\nSmiling face to hide the trace of hate\nBut my homie would never do me wrong\nThat's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on\nNo matter who the foe they must fall\nUs against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call\n\"If you ever need a place to stay\"\n\"Well, alright, y'all\"\n\"Brothers and sisters\"\n",
