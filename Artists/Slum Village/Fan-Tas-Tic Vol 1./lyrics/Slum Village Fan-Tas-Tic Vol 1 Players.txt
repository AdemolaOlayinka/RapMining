Players
It's the 788
DDT'n, just like Jake The Snake
Actually we don't participate
But if you do then I'mma see you at your wake
Players
Don't let the drama fluctuate
I don't want em
I got em, we cooking steaks
Now what would we be at if we let you do that
We'd probably be laying on our backs
Players
Talking this and that
You want my opinion your shit was whack
I never would, play myself out like that
But umm, I guess that's where you at
Players
And I'mma play this game for you
What I'mma do is like uhh
Call out your whole crew cause your crew likes to bite us
Y'all stick to freestyling cause y'all ain't no writers
Trying to be some players and can't play the game
See you sound the same and you claim to be
Something you ain't or won't be without S.V
Y'all need to be smacked open-handedly
(Players)
I could give a fuck about this shit
You all up in my face over some ho shit
Just come out, you wanna be with my clique
You must know, really how wild I get
When I walk in the place saying (players) yes, yes
There's some people who really wanna see the S
Personally I could give a fuck less
Check your lady, she's a groupie ho
Opening her coochie hole, fuck that ho
Eye to eye, they doing the Devoe
When you front, it's inspirational
You, you, or you, or you, or you, or you
Yo, yo, yo
You wanna be some (players) and can't play this game
You sound the same and you claim to be
Something you ain't or won't be without S.V
Y'all need to be smacked open-handedly by these
Players
Talking this and that
You want my opinion your shit was whack
I never would, play myself out like that
But I guess that's where you at
You wanna be a player for me to hold you up
You think I really give a fuck
You, and you, and you, and you and your crew
You think you just some players
