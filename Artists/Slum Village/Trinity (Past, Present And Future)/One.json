(One)\nIt only takes (One)\nso feel it y'all (One)\nNow every (One)\nIt only takes (One)\nYou only need (One)\nSo feel it y'all (One)\nWe're number (One)\nYou're not number (One)\nIt only takes (One)\nSo feel it y'all (One)\nIt only takes, to click clack the gun on 'em\nTo bring drama to 'em like Dee Witt we runnin' em\nOne, drama 'n I get the gun out the couch, run out the house\nWith the loaded pistol stuck in his crouch - One\nYou fuck it up for all of the rest\nYou n your niggas in the parking lot rollin' the cess\nTryin' to get up in some chickens that all in your shit\nThey all wit it, and all seem down to get it, except One\nShe ain't feelin' the crew\nPlus she got a man she don't like niggas like you\nShe said you fuck wit the niggas, you know how they do\nWe roll out, 'cause we see another we another set of dudes\nSo one - minute later, hear some shots in the air\nNiggas duckin' on the ground like guerilla warfare\nFuckin' up a niggas groove and when they know it ain't fair\nHe roll out with his niggas and his hands in the air\nSingin' One (one, one, one, one)\n\nIt only takes (One)\nTo rock it y'all (One)\nYou only need (One)\nTo do it y'all (One)\nIt takes, one, tragedy to bring a family closer\nOne bullet to start a war and be a part of gore\nThese hoes trick and be on crack like a slightly parted door\nIt took one hit, tongue kiss and make cum quick\nIt took one hit, for a wack rapper to make millions\nCausing the illest niggas to switch and spit what they ain't feelin'\nOne! Day a time of alcohol it takes to get by\nIs worth more than a mini puff it takes to get high\nOne, Love was the joint that my cousins used to breakdance to\nBefore they began to pop and lock with the glock handle\nThis -one- turn for the worst, my main concern for the earth\n'Cause it seems to get even worse when it turns\nPurposely burn an emcee, fricasee his hand holding the mic\nSo he can't fold it to write\nI'm potent as a lightning bolt when it strike\nAt least - one - feelin' me\nCome through ya city with sign and drown ya energy - One!\nOne, one, one, one\n\nNow every (One)\nIt only takes (One)\nYou only need (One)\nSo feel it y'all (One)\nOne of the best in the class it's so stupid\nOne who test it's tragic so don't do it\nGroup move crowds like they had us do with theme music\nSpit like cars when the body releasin' fluid\nOne, more tragic than ninety-one-one\nAlso we fearsome\nKnown as the Slum and that's just one organism\nOne crew comin' through 'cause we gotta hit 'em\nThose dudes too fly like the Continental\nTwo niggas on the side one up the middle\nIt's love in the club and it's constant\nWe drop shit and yell shit at the concerts\n\nOne...two...the whole world is\nTick tock, tick tock\nYou live by the clock but I move faster\nNiggas is sleeping 'cause they thinking that I procrati-nate\nOne of these days I'm a show you what I'm made of\nSoon as I'm done with these silly little rap scrubs\nSoon as I'm done making my rap million dollar hits\nSoon as I'm done cleaning my soul of this old curse\nSoon as I'm one with the universe\nI'm done with you little fucks in this little earth\nI rule a planet of my own where you don't exist\nEverything is One\n",
