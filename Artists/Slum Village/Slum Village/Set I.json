Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nCan I set it. Up, bout to set it, yeah!\nCan we set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nThey don't want it? Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nBout to set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nFitna set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\n\nAll my G's throw you triggers up\nBy the hammer my hand on the biggest nutts\nNo bamma, I blow gands when they split the blunt\nThis is for my niggas stuck, up in the ghetto\nPumping the metal, where they feel a fluff and they'll kill you\nThey quick to buck\nChicks trickin, chicken cluck\nSwitching up to your whip that your sister bumped\nYou'll be suckin' on tits and now your dick is sucked\nSteady counting figures up\nBenjamin's bend up to ten to twenty bucks\nFigured up on the Benz of any trendy truck\nI wedded and sticking up\nInnocent independent citizens\nNot givin' a cent of dividends, it could slit and cut\nI'm blowed and I'm liquored up, I've been told I'm cold as a winter month\nAnd showed I can explode when it sickens up, Bloaw\nBack on the style, let me pick it up\nDid you predict that what I spit on this hit is ridiculous\nI should tip my Pimping cup\nJust for pitching up percent of a pigeons rent\nGiven for living expense at the stripping club\nThey don't want it? Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nCan I set it. Up, bout to set it, yeah!\nCan we set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nThey don't want it? Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nBout to set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nFitna set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\n\nDon't let me catch you slipping up your numbers up\nGive and duck, or run a muck\nAttempt a jump like double jump, the clips'll bust\nYour clique is just sick of us\nBringing the heat steaming me swinging defeat\nYou street, dreaming on sleep, idiots?\nEl, the sickest you ever heard\nAnd predicting a set of words\nThat he stick in the head of nerds\nOr just gifted with lady curve and positions written to say something\nGotta stay buzzing coming of the line like a fadeaway Dr. J jumping\n\nCu-zin, we got the streets Buz-zin\nVilla blowing, bubb-ling\nThose who ain't caught on, fill em'... in\nWe in this grizzie now and we playing to win\nThey don't want it? Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nCan I set it. Up, bout to set it, yeah!\nCan we set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nThey don't want it? Ey! They don't want it? Nah!\nCan they get it? Yup! They can they get it? Yeah!\nBout to set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\nFitna set it. Yup bout to set it, yeah!\n",
