(We're coming to kill ya)\n\n\nIntroducing the world famous, Slum Village\nAre ya'll Ready baby? Let me know if ya'll ready\nAll the way from De- (Dj scratches) Detroit\n\nYeah Yeah\nYou look and stare\nI see you shook in prayer\nI bust at you, (bang) they cuffin' who?\nWhat you wanna do? 1 2, you wanna (uh)\nFor sho' ya do, if you hold a crew\nI don't need a clip, to bust your lip\nI run your shit, with a swift fist\nIf you gonna talk the shit (talk the shit)\nI'm aiming quick (aiming quick)\nYou better run (better run)\nCause I don't miss (cause I don't miss)\n",
