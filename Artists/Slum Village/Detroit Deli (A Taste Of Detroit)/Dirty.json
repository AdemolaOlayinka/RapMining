You know how we do\n\nGirl, if you're flexible, intellectual\nBisexual, can I get next to you\nIf you're flexible than, we can keep it dirty and sexual\nIf your man front, than we gotta knock the nigga out\nSmack the nigga up, stomp the nigga out, clap clap the nigga up\n\nShe got a man, but her man ain't me\nI'm a, M-A-C, to P-I-M-P\nI'mma, show her things, and spend a little cheese, baby\nCuz your man ain't doing the right thing lately\nYup, so I'm steppin in his house\nIf the nigga step up I'ma knock the nigga out\nSo I'm here with a beer and a glove\nWith some thugs and some chicks with some derry' ass\nShe got a man, it ain't fair, I don't care\nI ain't scared with my dudes and I come prepared\nLadies, lemme see what you workin with\nMake a nigga stay at home like a punishment\nI'm trying, to think of us, think of we girl\nThink about us, and some, and T3\n\n\nYeah, you know how Slum do, when we come through\nGum shoe, Air Force is a pair of Air Jordan's\nPelle Pel, are old school with gangsta white walls\nTailor suits, coordinatin' with the gator boots\nBefore you hate on what we do, it's a D thang\nYou flamin' at a Cappa/Rae offa Alize\nWhere the ladies at, pushin' back you Baby Phat\nMake it clap like eight gats\nStayin' at the Infenium, just use the key\nYou got a man, but what your man gotta do with me\nHe don't want it, nah, he don't know the nigga\nRoll with Dreadknotts, Cardy boys, and a mil', phat killas\nRaw CD twelve, but don't mind that\nAnd we should hit the telly up, I got the Remy and the dime bag\n\n\nKeep it dirty nuh\n\nWhat, they don't wanna fuck with us\nThey don't wanna feel the pain and get bruised and touched\nShe was down with your team, now she roll with us\nBrought he girlfriend with her and its all a plus\nShe wanna do what the players do, play how the players play\nAnd she don't like how you treated her anyway\n\nYeah, you said you love, but is it really real\nWould you break me off first, and let my nigga Phil hit you\nPicture my Caddy truck, we sexin' in the backseat\nOr in my room, you bucky naked in my black mink\nGirl, it's either 'this or that', like it's Black Sheep\nI know it's on, if you twistin' back my Pistons cap\nIgnore the phone, if it's your man, let the machine get it\nMatter fact, turn off the ringer, and let me lean in it\n\nKeep it dirty nuh\n\n\nFrom Detroit all the way to New York, we comes down\n",
