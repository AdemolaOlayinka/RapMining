Feelin' a little under the weather today\nBut I had some stuff to get off my chest you know\nNow what I'm about to say to y'all I might had never said to the general public\nSo y'all gotta hear me yo, feel me\nYo\nI know I might sound like I got a cold and I'm sneezing\nBut I'm grown and I'm breathin', hear the tone in my speakin'\nBoth of my parents gone for a reason\nDaddy's wrong just for leaving mother widowed and I'm breathin'\nNow spirits above the stones and the demons\nShe belongs in the teachin' where there's a throne in the kingdom\nAnd deep inside my bones I'm believin'\nthat my poems that I'm readin' is the songs to my freedom\nBut life can be known as deceiving, what I'm shown isn't pleasing\nMakes me wanna throw stones at a deacon in his home when he preachin'\nSee that's Satan makin' my heart cold as a breeze till it's frozen from freezin'\nGotta get right, I might not make it over this evening\nCause your time period is shorter than breath goin' from weazen\nHeard my nigga Tone, he was bleedin' through his clothes\nit was leakin' from some chromes that was squeezen\nThan when I'm all alone I be thinkin' I'm against All Eyez\nprayin' to God to show me the evens\nBut I'm sick of bein' poked through the seasons\nsmokin dro through the drinkin' with two hoes through the weekend\nAbout to go till I see\n\nLife can sometimes be so hard to bare\nWhen you feel like there's no one who cares\nThere are times you feel all hope is gone\nDon't loose faith and just keep holding on\nBut sometimes I feel alone in these streets\nagainst the cold of these streets my heart and soul on these streets\nI lost my mom so I hold to a piece of a place\nDead a time when we both inner-twined\nIt was love for a fatherless son\nAlthough he had love for a son visits were none to seldom\nI was sat on a porch till the mail come\nand when it came it never was a letter of my name (damn)\nBut moms was there for me, she held it down 'cause she cared for me\nShe never left even in her last path where she slept\nnext to death she was always at her best never stressed\nThat's why I love her\n\nYeah\nYou gotta keep holdin' on you gotta keep keep holdin' on keep holdin' on\nJust keep holdin' on you gotta keep keep holdin' on keep holdin' on yo\nKeep holdin' on you gotta keep keep holdin' on keep holdin' on\n",
