I'm designed\nIn the image of the most HIGH/ he assigned me\nSo I walk the earth with that jewel in my mindpiece\nTake my kibbles and bits and pieces of this\nDouble that stack it up get tha car and the crib\nSittin lovely... so defiant... my whole alliance on the same science\nFuck around and try us\nGiants... gold touch/Midas...\nWe don't talk much\nWe let our history define us!\n\nThey say the goal on the earth is just to get it\nSo I am try til I die til am a spirit\nLord said give it all so am a give it\nTil my plans on the earth is implemented\nSo I\nHustle big\nHustle small\nHustle big\nHustle small\n\nWake up in the morning thank jah 4 the blessing\nWipe my eyes still yawning get ready 4 2days lesson\nPositive thoughts... progression that's the mindset\nI got goals and dreams and they ain't mine yet\nI'm bangin in the paint... in the red zone third and goal\nGot my head down comin with my shoulder\nFailure is not an option u got one chance\nTo make the best out of this and I'm a fuckin dance\nU wanna be a star I'm beyond that\nReachin 4 the galaxies afar where the gods at\nPut me in a room where them odds at\nWatch me maneuver thru terrain like a bobcat... hustlin\nA wise man once told me it's a difference between a fantasy and a dream\nWhat's real and what's phony\nA fantasy is that it could never be\nA dream can be achieved look at me\n\nThey say the goal on the earth is just to get it\nSo I am try til I die til am a spirit\nLord said give it all so am a give it\nTil my plans on the earth is implemented\nSo I\nHustle big\nHustle small\nHustle big\nHustle small\n\nGet that feta a matter of fact, I never knew I had lack\nTill I saw that preacher with that cadailac\nI wanted one, I rode with nana ain't that batch of cookies\nHow they crumble I guess I got a start from scratch\nNo seminar to teach me how to win repeatedly\nI guess got to show me, what the school didn't teach me\nHustle getting more get accustom, get your credit score up now you can't tell'em nothing\nBut it didn't start as quick as that, I took a dead end job and lost and figured facts\nFigured if I saw the bigger picture and pictured that\nI get to where I'm going like a manifestation act\nI'll piggy back off this rap shit\nI'll catapult l I'm gone\nI'm well and established in years how I've grown\nEveryday is still a hustle, and even threw the struggle\nWe maintain we got to get it now we do it double\n",
