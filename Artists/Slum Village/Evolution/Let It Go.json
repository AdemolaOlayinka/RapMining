    "lyrics": "Life been pivotal, Ever since I disconnected from the umbilical\nCut ties human form physical, tunnel was my visual\nSet plots them bum bo clots, Sour like they swallowed jars of pickle juice\nWe did it tall like the hats worn by Dr. Seuss\nYou a cockatoo, binocular eyes I got of spotted you\nGiraffe neck took long steps, progress into success with a mean pair hiking boots\nI bared fruit without knocking dude\nEven though I saw the issues as small as pixels and particles\nShit I ain't mad at you I furthered you\nWanted you to be part of it too you doubt you cause you had mixed molecules\nHe flew the coop, I had to cut him loose\nHe should hung around, why cause I a noose you obtuse\nI'm difficult to understand too, that a excuse that niggas use when they true\n\nAnd yes I am high I just let it go\nOn the route to be indelible\nI know you know about it\nStreet dreams and nightmares\nCome alive in the night air I made a song about it\nAnd some how I just let it go\nLet the pain go\nLet the Stress go\nLet the fair go\nIt's our time. Go\n\nTunnel vision deep focus on the light at the end of it\nNo plan b's, just to eat I depend on it\nHad it all thought out but life put a spin\nStood my ground I'm a die or defend on it\nCome take a walk in these ten and a half\nSee what my eyes see, through these dark streets and paths\nSome trails is like crack vials\nJust smoke and mirrors\nIt's important to have disaplen I'm so serious\nMission is simple one goal success\nAsk jah bless all that my hands posses\nKeep my grass low all visual no seek attack mean that litural\nIt's fun how your dreams can be the next mans nightmare\nStay prepared they don't fight fair\nWhen you got that tunnel vision you move with vigor\nOr you can do sixty years forkilling a nigga\n\n\nHieroglyphic vivid calligraphy\nRap a wrap on this industry\nSalary caping ministries\nManifesting my vision\nThis is monumental\nBout to drop infection like I socked his whistle\nNice and simple mic and prices instrumental\nRide the rhythm like rahkim and them\nKilling niggas with Benjamin's\nBigga faces couldn't be more appropriate the picture on harol mcfarll\nAnd put a arrow through his marrow\nFrom the snipes barral and connect the dots like oriens belt\nI am felt niggas tried and felled get in line or bell\nPlus I rock your bells like a bell in some fly channel\nLight the l\nLift me up to heaven kiss my halo hello\nI am home, tell them play my song on the radio ni\n",
