Grande/cudjo of tha pack\nBlack suits reservoir dogs shovels in the back\nDigga ditch quicker don't let that liquor get u exposed\nOr feel that heat nigga 500 on the stove\nDon't make me go in beastmode Benicio\nLyrical Wes Craven so official\nCan't stop it, it's new 2 u so foreign\nSeventh Son stay shining/ Jack Torrence\nSlice ya spleen like a wolverine flee the scene like\nWill Randall walkin with a guillotine scream\nIf u wanna it just make my adrenaline rush\nI'm a life editor... predator\nMeet the messenger that ain't no metaphor\nLeave u needin medical attention lookin pitiful\nBeast with the beats on these streets J Incredible\nThrow u 2 the dogs let them feast on ya skeletal\n\n\nMine is loin with a electrical void of appliance half live half dead frankstein science\nDissect it, still don't know what I am, more like spirt of detroit in climate in rhymes\nSurvived when I dived I was in the great lakes, never drowning I knew how work with my surroundings\nNigga's got to see I'm astounding, I'm a downers, over bullshit walk on type rope and still new balanced do what I do that's challenge nigga's fuck with me on this planet\nIt ain't all smoke and phone cameras\nIt all good It's outlandish, nigga's straight they slanted, these a friends they addicts, this ain't how I feel it, it's basic mechanics\nBrave hearted, when with the will from the dearly departed, yeah we got it nailed it's the pros against the novice, yeah we eating well from the scales against carcass\nMoney all kinda ways\nHating niggas looking at the kid sideways\nCause everyday like a friday\nSo fuck em all what I say\nLong as the pies made everything hi grade\nAk arms reach wherever I lay\nI'm dat nigga what you trying say\nWe can make it happen hadle that right away\nI ain't trying to let the beef linger none\nGet up on you I ain't have to lift a finger son\nShow you how to bleed a lung\nSend you to the essence see you son\nA long kiss goodnight, niggas curios I show you what it look like\nWhat it cook like all day hood life\nNiggas money missing homie get ya books right\n\n\nYou can't find another nigga that's braver than me never\nAin't a nigga hotter than me, even with three sweaters\nGet as much nookie as I got as a rookie with these clever\nLines that I spit like darts\nSo psycho on the microphone now I wake up like\nWhy did I bite this shark? Rip it apart?\nAnd why did I light this spark in the middle of the day\nAnd why didn't I wait till dark?\n'Cause I am a beast and I'm on the feast\nI came to eat your heart\nWhat the fuck is this\nHannibal Lector, cannibalistic shit that I'm fucking with\nNow the microphone so hot I need an oven mitt\nRewind my verse to the top\nI know ya loving it\nThere's no way that I can stop, I gotta keep it going\nTill I feel that I am killing it\nAnd if I'm not I gotta start rewriting it\nGo under my hood and start rewiring\nAnd all you loose screws getting fired\nAnd I hope it's understood we not rehiring\nYou might as well just go and get a job at Coney Island\nWhile I vacation in Ireland\n",
