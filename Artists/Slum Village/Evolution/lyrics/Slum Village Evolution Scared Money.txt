Before you put it down you should think fam
Think how much you can make damn
Hundred grand on a ring brand
Scared money don't make na 

Man we got hoes, We got doe
We need to roll papers, we need roll
Yeah we those
We got shows, We get blowed
That's all you need to know
I got a throw back with reboc's on
When shorty sing that song
What she got on, It's hard for me not see that thong
It's hard for me not to breathe right on
Your neck show me respect if you see how long
I put in work I make her twerk it
I'm the officer searching for the murder
With the levies on
You can fuck with the team I'm on
We at the north pole we out cold

Before you put it down you should think fam
Think how much you can make damn
Hundred grand on a ring brand
Scared money don't make na 

Yea we dat boom
Been them dons since filas on
So flavorful better get you some
Vicious son bitches cum snitches run
From the 313 where dem piston from
Dis dat slum you dim ice berg slim
Drop head bangers excedrin
Veterans all gold medals man
Don't slow down foot on the pedal man
These sick verses need medicine
Let us in or become a vic-a-tim
Look at them foreign rides big ass rims
Only catch us with the finest fims

Before you put it down you should think fam
Think how much you can make damn
Hundred grand on a ring brand
Scared money don't make na 

AHH shit your money look frighten
The feta that I got a make a nigga pull
A heist in a bank
Can't caught us in a race
Nigga's so slow it's like he did a ball of H
Only way they see us if the lord understakes
Meanwhile I'm on a trip and exotic is the place
Never frantic and you know it's automatic
It's authentic like it's every other day
In the back of us surround us a mother fucking lake
Yeah, nigga's can't see my paps
And the wolfs that I got they will tare threw a gate
Damn, can't see me not way
Yeah off the henny we don't sip they rosay
Bouncing a city with some bitty in face
And you know she spending a pretty penny
Spreading those legs
You looking silly if every had beg uh
