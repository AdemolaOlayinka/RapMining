    "lyrics": "I put it all on the line everyday\nCause it's all that I got and I'm not trying to lose\nSo I recall in my mind everyday\nWhy I did what I did I had a lot to prove\nYou see I'm here and going nowhere o.o.o.oo\n\nNah ain't no opposition, never second to none\nSlum has begun a moving piston\nOvercoming slum is running\nWe optimistic even if fail like a transmission slipping\nI'm rolling I go the distance\nEngine smoking, I stay in motion I'm so efficient\nI had my ass out, no pot piss in\nMy intuition, told me not listen, niggas send you up the creek swimming\nWith hidden agendas and bad intentions\nIf I stumble that's a brief intermission cause I don't coincidentally\nLack I'm back it vengeance\nMy proclamation is to prove that I rock the nation\nThrew my occupation, make moves and not complicating\nHeart ache and pain, I just embrace it\nWhen I was a product of blame and hatred I didn't\nAsk why I face it\nNow I'm reading the Tao, taking a bow\nFlipping my style cause such and such couldn't figure me out\nOut\n\n\nI'm like a butterfly I can fly high to the top of the sky\nCame out of my cocoon to shine bright over the horizon\nRising like the sun up in the atoms\nI drop classic\nTo bad you didn't believe\nTold you nigs I had a trick up my sleeve here it is\nNew team, new sound\nWhole different flavor take a taste pass it around\nTaste good don't it\nKilling my opponents\nI know I'm getting on yo nerves like sera-toning\nGone and run yo mouth I hear the chit chatter\nI'm to big for small talk so y'all don't matter\nYou can be a giant like Goliath\nI'm a still triumph, like a flame walking through a fire\nNever a flaw rock hood to bos raw\nSpit it like cane from Bogota\nMy niggas vanguard I'm out\n\n\nI'm never goin away\nHad a burden on my shoulder\nBut it was tooken away\nAll of a sudden I'm on top of the world/ doin my thang\nWho is the blame\nOr what is my aim\nWhat am I saying\nI'm just saying... that I'm in it\nCause I love it skip the fame\nI'm just playing... with a nickel\nI don't care if lose it\nNot paying any attention\nJust Vibin to this music\nNo lens to straighten my vision\nLike I'm tryna hit a target\nAnd I don't care if I miss it\nIs it rocket science no not really\nI'm just really gifted\nJust a spiritual weapon\nGive you a lyrical whippin\nS... Villa bitch I'm Reppin\nYes... I'm da secret weapon\nI know you hear da bomb tickin\nI'm explodin any second\nAnd when it happens\nYou can call it da big bang\nI'm the new king\nMe and dilla switched chains\nBe dem Yancey Boys\nJohn and James\n",
