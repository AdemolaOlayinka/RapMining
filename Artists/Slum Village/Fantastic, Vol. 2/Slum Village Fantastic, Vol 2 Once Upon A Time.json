    "lyrics": "We gon rock a man cause we got the fresh tho\nOne-one time, two-two times, three...\nI'm on a mission\nI hold the pen and stay twisted\nThe competition my street cats will stay listening (word up)\nDetroit to New York I still walk the walk\nControl dancehall, chillin in my b-boy stance y'all\nNever was known to be an emcee\nI still rip and flip crowds into a frenzy\nReciting facts shit, and it's like herbs to bite\nBum rushing mic tec playing slowly at night\nCoincide with the mic take flight above shores (word of mouth)\nI separate mines from yours\nI look ya up and as I stare in your face\nYour big mind's on a hum hum\nThe one you got your idea from\nYeah I'm right here son, straight out the slum\nMakin tracks for dough, gettin paid to do shows\nSo when I blow (what) the niggas respect my flow\nAy yo I'm nice with the pill and I rock with Slum Vill\n\nAy yo, you want flows? We got tons of them\nPete, Slum and Tim trying to bank shit like the Huntington\nGet that money and dip\nFlash the cash in front of them\nNiggas gruntin' and shit\nSayin' nothin I'm done with them\nOh yo! Peeps ain't got a hold they gun on them\nCause if one of them cats jump, we all jumpin' in\nBelieve that!\nWe got somethin' for the some dumb\nBubble yum chewin that don't know what they doin' with this rap shit\nRap tactics automatic and the fact is y'all know you bored with the whack shit\nWe got that phat shit that auto and track shit and when you hear it man I don't know how to act, shit\n\nIt's like the first related verse and now we rock with the beat\nJust another causality for S and the V\nIt's like action is what we give and receive\nBest do believe we got some shit up our sleeves\nShit to dance to, some shit to the trees\nSome shit if you dyin' and they help you breathe\nMake a handicap nigga exceed with speed\nIt's like totally with Toronto to V\nDoin this for DET in the place to be\nCan't forget the rest R, O, I, and T\nMac Nicholas baby, what else could it be?\nPlease, lace me with a scratch for the beat\n\nIn the beginning, it was the S, never no name shit\nMotherfuckers traveled for miles to Mac Nick\nWe kick rhymes we know they never sound like yours\nTo the mic lookin' like cheap thoughts\nFuck this rap shit, I'm too smart for that\nI do this shit for kicks with my crew, believe that\nThe S is on the way to makin' emcees quick\nI shoot the kinda rhymes to make the emcees duck\nOn the mic I never fight I call an angel of war\nSlice an emcee with my palm, a lyrical sword\nYou really want a bottle? You must be ill\nWell it's the S, numero uno, I'm in your favorite\nThe negroes make the music that you run out to get\nNow this is love at the less, new bomb shit\nMac Nicholas is earnin' money on some burner shit\n\nWhat, Slum Vill and we out\nNo doubt for 98\nSettin ya straight\nGetcha self laced\nPeace\n",
