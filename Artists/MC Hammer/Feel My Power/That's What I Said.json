Now I can do it\nAww this that rollin beat man\nI can roll with this\nI can roll with this just like ridin over that Bay Bridge\nGolden Gate y'nderstandwhatImean?\nOh look at that skeezer over there man\nI ain't with it\nNow now now the drum gets deeper and the beats get stronger\nSo take a deep breath before you're forced under\nThe line that divides what's yours from mine\nIn effect is what I am cause I served my time\nConcrete solid beats topped off with rhymes\nA fly posse put together by the Hammer's mind\nNow the song is in effect and my soul is fed\nAnd these are my words, that's what I said\nThat's what he said\n(Yo hype my posse man)\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nM, MC's line up and they start to boast\nWho's the best, who's the best, and they all get roasted\nBy the Hammer on the mic, by the Hammer on the floor\nBy the Hammer, MC Hammer, the keeper of the door\nThat leads to the chair where the king of rap sits\nWhile MC's battle, in the rap pits\nThey go RHYME, for RHYME, and HOOK, for HOOK\nThugs turn rappers and rappers turn CROOKS\nNow the song is in effect and my soul is fed\nAnd these are my words, that's what I said\nThat's what he said\n(Yo hype my posse man)\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nDance!\nUse the Hammer as a weapon so don't you worry about a thing\nI don't worry about a thing, I'm goin straight up\nYou understand me? There they go\nThere go that big ol' greasy\nThat's what he said\n(Yo hype my posse man)\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nNow now now, I go to the show, I pay my money\nI realized, something's funny\nMusic's cold kickin and the crowd is hyped\nBut the MC on the stage, is stiff as a pipe\nHis hips do move but his feet don't budge\nHe moves across the stage like he's stuck on a rug\nHe needs the beat and the Hammer and the posse gettin busy\nThe show that we give, will make a sucker dizzy\nNow the song is in effect and my soul is fed\nAnd these are my words, that's what I said\nThat's what he said\n(Yo hype my posse man)\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\nGo posse, go posse go; go posse, go posse go\n",
