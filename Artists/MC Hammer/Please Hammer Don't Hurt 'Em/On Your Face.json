    "lyrics": "Ain't it funny that the way you feel, shows on your face\nAnd no matter, how you try to hide it'll state your case\nNow a frown will bring your sprits down to the ground\nAnd never let you see, the good things all around\nEverytime we seem to let our feelings flow\nOur luck run out and the wind won't blow\nBut that can't make me sad, just can't make me\nWhoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more\nThe world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad\nSadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life\nWhile you run your race, keep a smilin' face\nHelp you set your pace\nWish upon a sunny day, it'll turn to rain\nUse the sunshine in your heart to ease the pain\nWe wonder how your attitude is going down\nIs it wakin' and shakin' and safe and sound?\nEvery time we seem to let our feelings flow\nOur luck runs out and the wind won't blow\nBut that can't make me sad, that can't make me\nWhoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more\nThe world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad\nSadness bears no remedy for the problems in your life\nWhile you run your race, keep a smilin' face\nLife is on your case\nYes it is, yeah\nThis world can't shake me, bad times can't make me sad\nWhoa, 'cause I've been there before, don't wanna go no more\nThe world can't take me, won't let it drive me mad\nYou can't shake me the way I feel today\nCome tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way\nAin't it funny that the way you feel shows on your face?\nWake me! My heart is feelin' glad\nI'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad\nUse the sunshine in your heart\nYou can't shake me the way I feel today\nCome tomorrow I'll feel the same ol' way\nI start to wonder what's going down, gotta feel it, feel it\nWake me! My heart is feeling glad\nI'll take you with me when you're feelin' bad\nI start to wonder what's going down\nIn your life, is it safe and sound?\nI start to wonder if your life's all right\nAre you dealing with it everyday or does it cause you strife?\nYeah\n",
