(Help the children)\nA generation's trying (bombs and crack)\nOh, how we're dying\n(Dance, help them)\nWill you let them be? (Help the children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA better day is coming (we need love)\nTo keep our lives going\nLife is here and then it's gone\nAnd what seems right can be oh-so wrong\nLet's protect, and not molest... a young girl\nAnd help them live to see... this world\nClearly, as it is\nAnd pray for the mother with kids (kids)\nWho's lost control, but not her soul\nMany kids will die before they're 20 years old\nWill you let them be? (Help our children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA generation's trying (bombs and crack)\nOh, how we're dying\n(Dance, help them)\nWill you let them be? (Help the children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA better day is coming (we need love)\nTo keep our lives going\nPops (pops) where in the world have you gone\nI see Momma (momma) by the telephone\nWaiting (waiting) but you don't call\nTears on her face and I see them fall\nIt hurts (hurts) but will go on\nYou're just another brother who's left his home\nAnd family (family), yeah we cry,\nMomma says she love you and I don't even know why (why why why)\nWill you let them be? (Why? Help them. Help our children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA generation's trying (bombs and crack)\nOh, how we're dying\n(Dance, help them)\nWill you let them be? (Help the children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA better day is coming (we need love)\nTo keep our lives going\nMoney and death, the lie, the truth\nA dime bag of crack, the end of you\nBlack and white, a constant fight\nYears and years, and day and night\nThere was a right, I've got to stand\nTo make a better way for a young black man\nIn a land (a land) where the people smile\nBeen holding me back for such a long while (while, while, wow, while)\nWill you let them be? (Help our children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA generation's trying (bombs and crack)\nOh, how we're dying\n(Dance, help them)\nWill you let them be? (Help the children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA better day is coming (we need love)\nTo keep our lives going\nHelp them, will you let them be?\nChildren (children) don't be fooled\nAnd learn about the way that man was ruled\nThis country (country) where we live\nAnd read about the sixties and what they did\nSo that we (we) won't forget\nAnd love one another and give respect\nWhen I see (see) a man who's old\nA woman who's grey, it touches my soul\nBecause I know (know) they paved the way\nSo we could be here and live this way\nThere was a time (time) not long ago\nWhen in the-front-of-the-bus into the back I had to go\nIt appears (it appears) that things have changed\nMaybe it's in the method but it's still the same game (game, game, game, game, game, game)\nWill you let them be? (Help our children)\nWill you help the children live to see... (Help the children)\nA generation's trying (bombs and crack)\nOh, how we're dying\n(Dance, help them)\nWILL YOU LET THEM BE?!?!?!\n",
