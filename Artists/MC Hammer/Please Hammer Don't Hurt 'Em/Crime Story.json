No glory\nScene III, the pimpin' game\nNow I'm pimpin' these berries, got to get that money\nThose suckers still payin' for a little bit of honey\nNothin' in this world can stop my flow\nAIDS ain't done nothin' but help my business grow\nMy babes are trained to make that dollar\nTo take you out, fool, it ain't no bother\nYou dropped your pants and you pay the price\nYour money maybe AIDS, fool, and then your life\nYeah, that's right 'cause a pimp got to make it\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nWe're talkin' about crime stories\nAnd I ain't givin' up no propers, no glory\nCrime Stories, all the real brothers have been locked up\nAnd you know they don't wanna go back, no glory\nScene IV, the pimp got took out by Barry's brother\nWe got this tip on some new fresh bait\nMoney in their heads and they could hardly wait\nMy girls went to their room to make the play\nTwo suckers at once, yeah, would make my day\nNow I'm outside some suckers walk up\nTalkin' real hard about smokin' my butt\nHe pushed the button, the blade came out\nCut me on my throat and then a bullet in my mouth\nI guess the devil got all the babes in hell\nMaybe he'll let me work with him? Ssh\nCrime stories\nI'm tellin' ya, man, you get no glory\n'Cause I'm not gonna mislead my young brothers\nCrime stories, if you've ever been locked up\nYou know the true stories, no glory\nAnd I'd like to say this before we get outta here\nTo my brothers in the game, my brothers\nWho are out there doin' what they feel they've got to do\nI wanna ask you one favor, let's let the young kids 10, 11, 12 years old\nLet's let them go on and do their thing at the schoolhouse\nLet's give them a chance to make it\nLet's give them a chance at a different life\nYou doin' what you feel you have to do\nBut they youngsters and they don't know any better\nSo we want to give them a chance to live\nI mean life is precious, and you know that yourself\nAnd you try to make a better life for yourself\nSo what I'm sayin' this from the bottom of my heart, let the kids be\nHelp the children lead to another way\nAnd peace from you and I love you and I'm outta here\n",
