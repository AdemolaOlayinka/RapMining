Fresh to LL or DJ Run\nThey say hammer how you do it? I got it like that\nMy posse's ever rollin, We keep it in tact\nJust put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded\nMy beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started\n\n\nNow, a lot of b-boys make em dance, Yo they fakin the beat\nThey hip hop on the outside put rock underneath\nBefore the show gets started, They shakin they boots\nMy posse in the end cold displayin the troops\nLike a trooper, I'm down cold hooked on the drugs\n808 SB12'S are expirin africans\nJust put on the hammer, And you will be rewarded\nMy beat is ever boomin, And you know I get it started\n\n\nThey said it couldn't happen, that rap wouldn't last\nThe beat is in effect like the oil in your gas\nCause it's makin lots of money from top to bottom\nWhatever in effect, Yo, B-boys have got em\nNobody knows how a rapper really feels\nA mind full of rhymes, and a tongue of steel\nJust put on the hammer, and you will be rewarded\nMy beat is ever boomin, and you know I get it started\n",
