Hammer he will\nHammer, you ain't hittin' in New York\nWhat?\nSo what you gon' do about that, Hammer?\nI'm gon' turn this mutha out.\nHammer, he is...\nStrong like a lion, no denyin'\nI'm in effect and you suckas are tryin'\nTo get with me, you can't hang\nDoin' it like this, I'm in with a bang\nGoin' boom like thunda, and you wonder,\nHow in the world can the Hammer be underneath me?\nHe's gonna beat me, say yes to the master and I will teach thee\n\nTurn this mutha out\nTurn this mutha out\nTurn this mutha out\nTurn this mutha out\nHammer, tell 'em how you came up babeeee!\nI was a student, now I'm the teacher,\nI was a member, now I'm the preacher,\nI was a worker, and you were the boss,\nNow I'm gettin' paid and you're takin' the loss\nOnce says stop, the other says flee\nNo, don't perpetrate M.C. Hammer is the feature\nStep off, you punk, no fear, I'm M.C. Hammer and I came here to...\n\nI'm improvin', better start schoolin\nHeaded to the top where I'll be rulin'\nOn top, of hip-hop, I'm in effect and you're not\nYour records aren't cool, your shows are weak\nDuel with the Hammer and meet defeat\nEvery night, every week,\nI'm comin' correct, you don't want none of me.\n\nI keep hearin' what you sayin'\n\"Yo Hammer, we knowin' New York's on the wayin'\"\nI don't care where you from,\nI make most look silly, and others look dumb\nYeah suckas, you should, run,\nI am, def on the stage, pumpin' at the club\nHammer is an eagle, and you a dove\n\n\n\nI'm from Oaktown, B-boy straight down\nTakin all comers, whoever want to get some\nI'm original, you're digital\nYou want somethin' to say, you're show is pitiful\nDon't worry, I'm in tact\nWhatever I say, the Hammer will back\nTwice as strong, It's goin' on\nAnd I willll...\n",
