I gotta get my, get my one mo time!\nI'm goin fo' mine, one mo time.\nI'm gettin my goals accomplised while the others sit back and wind.\nAnd none of y'all can fade me so don't even try,\ncause I'm the best at what I do and I'm a tell you why.\nSo you see I'm too legit too ever quit,\nI started gaining momentum when they put me in the mix.\nYou'll feel my power, The stage I'll burn it up.\nSo put it on the hammer, then people'll burn it up,\nto the records who tryed to diss this is on yo face,\nI'll turn this mutha out leave you lookin disgraced.\nBet you can't touch, and now you regret\nfo calling yourself a pet instead of something wet.\nNow brothers went long, it's still the same song,\nwhile people rollin' on, your crew is gone.\nYou know I got it started with a kickin' gold rhyme,\nsuckas betta' pray cause it's hammertime. One mo' time.\n\nCheck I peepin over there if the fellows give me ten minutes,\nI'll bet you I'll be in em',\nCause growin on the high street taught me how to get em'.\nI grew on em' so tight I'm known to hight em' and quit em'.\nSee I step to her, She's mine in a matter of minutes,\nIt ain't how long you talk it's what you put in em'.\nSpittin this game so cold and you tellin' me\nthat I'm not able to pick up this freak, well you fail to see.\nThe hard nigga is what they call me, and every year I'm at the player's balgee.\nWhenever I'm next you can prepare to see a show,\nand whenever it comes to breakin' it up you know I'm lettin em' win the net.\nAnd I'm the man in command, so I'm puttin em' in their place,\nand if she's lookin for handouts then get outta' Hammer's Face.\nI'm not the type to wine and dine, but I'm freak to blow your mind,\nso I guess I'm goin fo' mine, one mo' time.\n\nHold Now, Take me To The Bay\nI'm Gainin momentum from the 90's to the bay,\nand everywhere I went, I made the people say Heeeeeey!\nI'm makin' em' all amazed in every phase,\nand rap fools I gotta serve em', but this time the Hammer gotta hurt em'.\nState to state after partyin' in Casinos, Doin, and tryin that, lougin in Reno.\nI got it started in Bangcock and rocked Barbados,\nand watched Holyfield know em' out in Vegas.\nCity after City I left the people in shock,\nYou betta' have believed I left the whole place rock.\nAnd I love the way that the money just rolls out,\nfifteen hundred cities every one of em' sold out.\nPrivate jets, good times and bad times,\nsuckas be tryin' to diss so I'm comin' with mad rhymes.\nAll of these things often come to mind, but guess what y'all?\nHere comes the payback to her. Im doin' it one mo' time.\n\nI'm givin it to em one mo' time. Heeeeey\n",
