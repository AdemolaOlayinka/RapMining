From usin' what we get paid,

You wanna meet the peach?
I'll put you like Hippos,
In the backseat of my Caddy,
You'll be callin' me Hammer daddy.
I'll work you like a slave,
Misbehavin' you were gonna,

Hit the streets,
Caught up in your deuce,
And I was ready to predict it all,
Honkey tonk double,

Along with the 
And then the preacher,
Yo find me on the video award.

For all the sirens and music awards.

The joker's been talkin',
To talk that talk,
You gotta walk that walk.
Oh, the Hammer man's talkin',
So enter the dragon,
And once you burned up,
Those  caught in a ditch
And my bandwagon.
Suckers,

You're in a hot seat,
When I start talkin' to ya.

And it came from Oakland.

You're supposed to be talkin' 
But I'm calling your bluff, trick,

Everyone still can't touch...

With the average flow.

I'm fed up,
So I gotta set 'em up.
Not gonna never, ever let 'em up.
I'm like a tricky back kick,
I  read 'em up.
However, if you wanna swing,
Then we can get 'em up.
Black cheek,
You're weak.
You're meat.
You're tryin' to grow feet,

First, I'm 
Talkin' about my mama's pride,
Brother line, bread,

I'm a goin' to blow your mind.
So!
Since I'm not the one,
Who for real,
I feel the need to tell ya,
If you wanna be,
You gotta be real.
If you feel my way,
Like I used to say,
Homeboy, you better pray,
Just to make today.
I know what it is.
Keep sayin',
We don't find work, then,
I don't wanna 
So you figured I'm a sellout.
When we meet up on the street,
Then we'll see who bail out.
And it's all good.
