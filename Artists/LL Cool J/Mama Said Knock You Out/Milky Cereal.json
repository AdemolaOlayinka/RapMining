Boy, are your crazy?\nI said, \"Nah, I wanna ride in a Mercedes\nShe could sing while I'm swingin my thing\nCause her burgers taste better than Burger King\"\nHe said, \"Go party, do some minglin\nYou and my daughter, your brain must be jinglin\"\nI said, \"It's smooth, no disrespect\nShe'll sign a pre-nup, so she don't get half of my week check\"\nThen we walked down the aisle\nOur honeymoon was milky - cereal style\n\nYou know what I'm sayin?\n\nMilky\nCereal\n(Baby)\nMilky\nCereal\nMilky\n\nHa-ha-ha\nPeace!\n",
