Oooooohh!!\nListen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew\nDamage (UHH) damage (UHH) damage (UHH) damage\nDestruction, terror, and mayhem\nPass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him\nFarmers (What!!!) Farmers (What!!!)\nI'm ready (we're ready!!!)\nI think I'm gonna bomb a town (get down!!)\nDon't u neva, eva, pull my lever\nCuz I explode\nAnd my nine is easy to load\nI gotta thank God\nCuz he gave me the strength to rock\nHARD!! knock you out, mama said knock you out\n",
