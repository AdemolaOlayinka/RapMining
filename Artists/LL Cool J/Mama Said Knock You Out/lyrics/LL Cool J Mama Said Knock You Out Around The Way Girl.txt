Mama Said Knock You Out
1990)
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
(On your loving)
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings
At least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion
Using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl she's from around the way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in them
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap but petty 
You're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
(Oooh you love me)
Come around my way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
To the bridge
I need an around the way girl
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
With that New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here
You say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your home girls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for whining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee I love you
You're from around the way

I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She don't love him
(You got me shook)
I need an around the way girl
An around the way girl
Fine as can be
(Oooh you love me)
She oh yea
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
The only one for me
I need an around the way girl
An around the way girl
Fine as can be
(You got me shook up shook down shook out on your loving)
