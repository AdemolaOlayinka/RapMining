That's something we will talk about\nHe's smart enough to have ya, but dumb enough to let ya out\nI like ya Fendi bag your alligator shoes\nYa hairstyle and ya whole point of view\nThe way you lick your lips and stare\nYou tell me that's a habit hmmm yeah\nHoney coated legs, with not one scar\nThe stylish wardrobe is up the par\nHere's my number, call me in my car\nYou deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar\n\n\nSo how long you been talking to him?\nWord, nah he's cool with me, he's cool with me\nOh he loves you\n\n\nHoney open up a bottle of brandy\nBetter yet have a piece of Cool J candy\nAnd sweat the man with the master disaster\nBreak ya like plaster-plan and\nThe cards on the table and the deal is dealt\nUh, I'm in the mood for a tuna melt\nAnd I can't make you, I sure wouldn't rape you\nFeeling kinda mellow and I sure would hate to leave the job half-done (Nah!)\nCause at a time like this you're the one that I'm looking for,\ncrawling on the floor (WOOF!)\nI'm coming back for more\nIf the Mona Lisa's name was Teresa\nI'll get a piece-a of the Mona Lisa, then smoke a cigar\nYou deserve a visit from Mr. Goodbar\n\n\nYeah, so you be calling on the request line\nHahahaha oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nOh he's my man, word him too\nYeah I like Bobby Brown\nTell him he's cool but:\n\n\nDon't be cruel cause you'll be on your own\nIt's my prerogative and my microphone\nCome and get this ice-cream cone\nOr I'll deliver it when your daddy ain't home\nGrown and healthy that's how I like em\nBig juicy legs and a nice pair of kegs\nHmmm, Mr. Good bar style\nYou haven't met a guy like me in a while\nI jump out a cake, dance, play, shake I ain't got no Body by Jake\nSmooth as Whitester extra dry Moetzer\nChandon and I'll slip it in your mouth like a Bon-Bon\n\n\nYaknowhatI'msayin?\nI'm Mr. Goodbar (Goodbar) yeah\nSo you know next time uh your man is out\nCheck my (???)\nNah, nah he's cool\nBut my girl oh I don't know your man might be with her uh\nYaknowhatI'msayin?\nBut I'm with you, yeah Mr. Goodbar baby, uh\nMay I say may I say that outfit you got on\nIs slammin', juicy lips so honey coated hmmm\nYo he never says that to you\nHe never gives you compliments\nYo he be giving you flowers baby\nAnd telling you how much he cares for you\nDoes he hold you and caress you and give you affection\nI didn't think so\n",
