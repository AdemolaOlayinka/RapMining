You said that shit before\nBut you see miracles when you're lyrical\nOff some LL shit, chickens get hysterical\nCos I..... form like Voltron\nLet's get it on and take ya chime bomb\nKnock it off\nI like your style but it's a slight bit soft\nSon, the LL rule, huh\nI pick it up and lay it down mad cool\nIt'll cost you a fortune (What?)\nFor me to make it hot, heat it up and keep it scorchin\n\n\n\n\nIt's all built for '96 kid!\nNo diggity, ?Rehaud? lace me\nNahmean? Lil Chris in the house\nOl Moms, Big E and the fam\nYo son, who's next?\n",
