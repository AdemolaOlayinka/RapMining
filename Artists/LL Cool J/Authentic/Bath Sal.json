I skywalk with the forces\nBack in the 80's I was playin in Porsches\nMoney ain't a problem, I toll my losses\nMaserati coup, take galloping horses\nNah, there's never been one like me\nThey're looking for a new me as if there might be\nEven with a love song, that's unlikely\nIf L ain't the dope, may lightning strike me\nUh, killin Queens all day\nI got what you want, what you willin to pay?\nYour boy ladies love sound, clean on the track\nSlip into the bath salt, wash my back, come on\n\n(Push it) never 'cus I have to\n(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard\n(Push it) and I got the game mastered\n(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment\n(Push it) we back to the basement\nHand on my nuts, that's product placement\nThe game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went\n(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\nPush it real good\n\nHonestly I was scared to come back\nIt was ugly not knowing how the game would react\nSaid my old gym teacher, he supposed to rap\nBut now I teach class, put back Tony\nYou see it in my eyes, transparent like glass\nGiving all for my soul to have another smash\nYea, LL Cool J\n30 years later, be me for a day\nSame day, just a daddy, she love me anyway\nSo I told er what to read and I showed er how to pray\nCats on my team, got NBA\nBut it's my black, from the web we stay\nI don't whack my suicides, I act my age\nNever try to sound like a rapper I raised\nRoared as a tiger, can't grow no brains\nBut the money's coming in in 360 ways\n\n(Push it) never 'cus I have to\n(Push it) it's because I'm a bastard\n(Push it) and I got the game mastered\n(Push it) ear drums, dealing with harassment\n(Push it) we back to the basement\nHand on my nuts, that's product placement\nThe game lost it's flavor, I wonder where the taste went\n(Push it) I said I wonder where the taste went\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\n(Push it) slip into the bath salt\nPush it real good\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nLookin kinda salty over there\nThey's are kinda salty over there\n",
