Listen to em, we don't give a damn\n\nGive it up\nI'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop\n(You don't stop)\nBaby bring me closer\nTake it off\nI'm a love it, boy, I won't you stop\n(You don't stop)\nBring it closer and closer\n\nAha, know what I mean?\nSo you can get yo 2 step on, you know?\nIt's what we love, you know what I'm sayin?\nI'll love you, boy I won't stop\nIt's the music we love, you know what I mean?\nYou know?\n",
