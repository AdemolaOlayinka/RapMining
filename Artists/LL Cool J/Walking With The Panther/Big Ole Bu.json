    "lyrics": "I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake\nPlayin' the wall, takin' a break\nAdmirin' the girls with the bamboo earings\nBaby hair and bodies built to swing\nThat's when I seen her\nHer name was Tina\nGrace and poise kinda like a ballerina\nI said, \"How you doin', my name's Big L\nDon't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell\nBut then again I'm livin' kind of foul\n'Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl\"\nTo make a long story short, I got the digits\nCalls her on my car phone and paid her a visit\nI was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her\nLayin' like a king on sheets of satin\nThat's what time it is, you know what's happenin'\nShe had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty\nI mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie\nBut Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness\nWith the kind of legs that put stockings out of business\nWhen I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek\nBut in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak\nI sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in\nAnd said to her with a devilish grin...\n\nTINA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut TINA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\nTINA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut TINA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\n\nI went to the high school about three o'clock\nTo try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock\nMy homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'\nCold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'\nGirls all over, the kind I adore\nI felt like a kid in a candy store\nThat's when I seen her\nHer name was Brenda\nShe had the kind of booty that I'd always remember\nI said to my man, \"Stop the jeep\"\nShe's only senteen but, yo, don't sleep\nI kicked the bass like an NFL punter\nAnd scoped the booty like a big game hunter\nI said to the girl, \"Yo, you look tired\nLet's go get some rest, relax by the fire\"\nI put the big booty on a bearskin rug\nShe gave me a kiss, I have her a hug\nI said to the girl, \"them young boys ain't nothin'\nYou want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button\"\nI circled it and teased it and made her squeal\nGrabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel\nWhen I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes\nWhen to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies\nTina busted in my house while I was eatin'\nYou know what I said\nToo bad you caught me cheatin', but...\n\nBRENDA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut BRENDA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\nBRENDA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut BRENDA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\n\nI went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak\nAround the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break\nI pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car\nSomebody shouted out, \"I don't care who you are\"\nI paid it no attention, I walked inside\nBecause Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride\nI walked in the place, everybody was lookin'\nAnd shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'\nI sat down to eat, ordered my food\nI said to the waitress, \"I don't men to be rude\nBut I'll take you on a platter\"\nShe said, \"You got a girl,\" I said, \"It don't matter\nYou look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza\nWhat's your name?\" She said, \"My tag says Lisa\"\nI said, \"O.K., you're smart and all that\nBut when you get off work, yo, I'll be back\"\nShe looked at me and said, \"Make yourself clear\nL, where we going?\" I said, \"Right here\"\nShe looked kind of puzzled, I said, \"You'll see\"\nI pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.\nWhen she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat\nPushed her back inside and pulled off her coat\nLaid her on the table and place my order\nAnd habe her a tip much bigger than a quarter\nOn and on to the break 'a dawn\nAll over the restaurant, word is born\nI heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch\nI couldn't believe it said nine o'clock\nI grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol\nWho did I see, Oh, yo, it was Brenda\nYo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember\n\nLISA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut LISA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\nSee ya\nLISA got a big ole butt\nI know I told you I'd be true\nBut LISA got a big ole butt\nSo I'm leavin' you\nSee ya\n",
