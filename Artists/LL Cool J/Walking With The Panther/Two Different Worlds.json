(it doesn't matter)\nTwo different, (two different) two different,\nwe're from two different worlds (I don't care)\nTwo different (so what), two different worlds...\n\n\nIt could never make a difference in my heart\n(It could never make a difference)\nNever could keep us apart (Whoooo... yeah)\nHold on (hold on) who cares what the world is sayin'?\n(I do) My love goes so deep, (mmmm, baby), hold on\nI know baby, let's take it to the climax\nTwo different, (two different) two different (so different)\nwe're from two different worlds (I don't care)\nTwo different (so what), two different worlds...\n\n\nSo what's it gonna be, you wanna be with me?\nI wanna be wit'chu, my love is true\nAll you gotta do is get into love\nIt's like a blessin' in disguise, sent from up above\nThis is your last chance, real not fate\nGive me a break, don't make a mistake\nCause I'm for real, I want you for my girl\nI don't care if we're from different worlds, but we're from\n\n\nTwo different, (two different) two different (so different)\nwe're from two different worlds (uh, I don't care)\nTwo different, two different worlds... (who cares baby\nyou gotta understand, you gotta understand, just take my hand, come on baby)\nTwo different (have a heart honey), two different worlds... (I want you, I need you)\nWe're from two different worlds (take my hand honey)\nTwo different, (don't fool with the mood baby) two, different worlds (take me by hand)\nYou don't seem to understand (I understand baby, we're two, we can work it out)\n(We can find a way), we're from, (self will change baby...)\nwe're from two different worlds\n(We're the perfect match, I love you), two different\n(trust me, have faith in your heart, baby) worlds\nI'll treat you right baby, I'll treat you right baby, I'll promise you)\nTwo different (you never meant as much to me till tonight), two different\n(I'll always love you), we're from two different worlds (I'll never forget you)\nTwo, two, two, different (trust me, hold my hand, have faith in me baby\nunderstand me sweet-heart, I love you...)\n",
