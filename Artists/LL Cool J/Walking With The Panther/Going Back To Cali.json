I don't think so\n\nGoing back to Cali, stylin, profilin\nGrowlin, and smilin, while in the sun\nThe top is down, on the black Corvette\nAnd it's fly, cause it's sittin on Dayton's\nLaurents steering wheel, plushed out, gold-leaf phantom top\nand three girls waiting\nVRRRROOM engine's blowin, the chrome, is shining\nPassing all the cars on the way\nMovement of the wind, back wheels spin\nPop in a cassette and push play\n\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali - yea y'all, I don't think so\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali..\n\nI'm going back to Cali, shakin 'em, bakin 'em\nTakin 'em to spots they never before hung\n?? the place, on Sunset it's a trip\nWhere the A.C.'s cold, and the girls still strip\nThe record skip, but this girl kept dancin\nPrancin, grindin, grinnin, romancin\nI asked her to the barn, so we could hit the hay\nI wanna do this, Brutus, but I don't wanna pay\n\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali - no man I don't think so\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali..\n..\n\nI'm going back to Cali, rising, surprising\nAdvising realizing, she's sizing me up\nHer bikini - small; heels - tall\nShe said, she liked, the ocean\nShe showed me a beach, gave me a peach\nand pulled out the suntan lotion\nNow I thought that was fast, but this girl was faster\nShe's lookin for a real good time\nI said, \"Close your eyes, I got a surprise,\"\nand I ran away with the bottle of wine\n\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so\nI'm going back to Cali, Cali, Cali\nI'm going back to Cali.. I don't think so\n",
