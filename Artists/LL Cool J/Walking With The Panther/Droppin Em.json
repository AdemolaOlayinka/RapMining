I just max like I'm playin the sax\nand take the crowd to the climax\nYo - Cool J, I'll never go astray\nI'm funky you can hear me at the Milky Way\nYou're weak, wick raps, I'm cool as jazz\nGot razamatazz ask my man Shabazz\nI know you're afraid because I'm self-made\nI invade, and blow up like a hand grenade\nMC's are terrorstruck, I'ma run amuck\nCause your rhymes suck, you made a record on potluck\nJust a toy boy, can't stop my convoy\nRhymes I said last year were just decoys\nI'm like a fox, you annoy me like chicken pox\nI'm back with a style that's unorthodox\nYou musta had a teaspoon full of bull\nI'm like The Hulk, with more bulk, I'm powerful\nThey try to get with this, to me that's an insult\nBoys shouldn't mess with an adult, that's too difficult\nI enter like a giant sayin fee fi foe fum\nThen rock the auditorium until it's pandemonium\nI'm droppin em\n\nYo E, droppin em\n\nDon't sleep - cause I'ma go deeper\nAll you sleepers, I'm the Grim Reaper\nMy rhymes are rising, the angle's gettin steeper\nI hated Mussolini Martini so I'ma sweep a\nemcee, like he's one of the two\nBreak him into fragments right in front of you\nMic check one two, is too fundamental\nMy rhymes are monumental over an instrumental\nIn the center, I had to enter\nTormentor mentor experimentor and inventor\nof lyrics, so all you non-believers\nIt'll echo in your dreams at night when you receive a\nrude awakening, you can't do anything\nYou enter my kingdom and you cry as men bring\ngifts to the prince of excellence and magnificence\nAlarm clock rings, you wake up, and you're convinced\nthat the crew invader, soloist exterminator\ngreater evador of ducks, concert crusader\nis BAD, my nickname's the circuit breaker\nEatin up the world, acre by acre\nI'm droppin em\n\nWord to mother, droppin em!\nKnowhatI'msayin? Straight til 1999, droppin em!\nYo, year two thousand, yaknahmsayin?\nAudi man\n\nYo I'm droppin em\n",
