2008)
March, march, march, march
Boomdizzle, baby
Way back in 1776
Who would have thought we would have had these chicks
Sum kinda slim and some extra thick
They make me feel so patriotic
Man, American girls are something to see
I bet Thomas Jefferson would love B E T
This is a celebration all across the land
Light the fireworks, bring out the marching band
Uncle L, I love the heart land
South Carolina, they lookin' so tan
Out in Kansas, they so outlandish
Up in Nebraska, I know whatcha after
Bubble baths and Budweiser, joy and laughter
A good ol' boy that's not tryin' to gas ya
American girl, no doubt who the best are
I get harder, faster than a car in Nascar
Make more reveal, I wanna ride again
The red coats are comin', fuck it, let 'em in
The king of England woulda left us alone
If he saw Jessica Simpson eat an ice cream cone
Teeny bikinis, red, white and blue
American girl, I salute you
From Massachusetts to Albuquerque
Back to the Mid West, as sweet as the dessert be
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl
You know I wanna hold you
Here's something you can roll to
You're my American girl, American girl

I'm so glad that French helped us out
Now you're free to walk around and let your cleavage bounce
The Founding Fathers would've been hot and bothered
Watching boomdizzle, you know what I'm talking about
From Philadelphia to Illinois, St. Louis, Alabama
Country Gramma
Queens, New York, Detroit to Montana
Today's your day girl, let's raise the banner
Benjamin Franklin, I so wanna thank him
Take a look at these girls, they the best in the world
Blonds and brunettes, redheads with curls
March with me girl and let your baton twirl
Champagne corks were bursting in the air
Gave prove through the night, my girls were still there
I'm a drum major, leading you to the flavor
Go ahead and shake whatcha mama gave ya
Oh, oh, say can you see
By the dawns early light
Party with me every night
Let down your hands, alright
Whatever you do, don't lose this all fast
I'ma have to fly my flag at half mass
You go girl, you make me wanna holler
Take George off and put your boobs on the dollar
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl
You know I wanna hold you
Here's something you can roll to
You're my American girl, American girl

I'm the master of the ceremony, go ahead, yell
Put your hand in the air, bring the liberty bell
I give you the John Hancock if you don't tell
Let's have the Boston Tea party, what the hell
Celebrate the day Crispus Attucks fell
So we could use our parts and rock to LL
36 double D's never troubled me
Thank god that Columbus made that discovery
The queen of Spain, spends some change
Now Paris Hilton is pushing the range
Stars ride by while the chauffeur's drive
But all you girls with 9 to 5's dance with pride
This is the USA, great to be alive
Great watch the videos with them big ol' thighs
Brown and blue-green and hazel eyes
All directed straight towards the prize
Any shape or size, all different types survive
Around the way girls, ready to ride
Farmers daughter on the John Deer with pride
Conservative blue bloods, intelligent minds
With them girls next door, they put me under a spell
I'm on top of the world, I'ma screaming to tell
I love the USA girls
Almost as much as The Giants beat Green Bay, girl
I see you out there dancing
Looks like you need romancing
You're my American girl, American girl
You know I wanna hold you
Here's something you can roll to
You're my American girl, American girl
