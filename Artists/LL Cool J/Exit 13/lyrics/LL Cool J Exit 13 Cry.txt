When I cry baby you cry 
When we cry baby, it's like 
You know, ohh oh 
How love goes, say it again 
When I cry baby you cry 
When we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh) 
You know (Ohh oh) how love goes (Now give it to em) 

How ever it go I'm going out for ya girl, 
If I'm a stick up kid I'm pullin' out for ya girl, 
If I was hustling I'd pump coke for ya girl, 
If I was a dred then I'd smoke for ya girl, 
I play captain,rock the boat for ya girl, 
I play martin and bring hope to ya girl, 
When I was away look how I wrote to ya girl, 
Wasn't I polite when I spoke to ya girl, 
Tricked on you cop that coke for you girl, 
I'd do anything but go broke for ya girl, 
Since I'm a rapper I wrote a song for ya girl, 
Since I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for ya girl, 
Lift some weights and keep it hard for ya girl, 
Sunday morning pray to God for you girl, 
If that don't work catch a charge for ya girl, 
Or flip some bars become a star for ya girl, 

When I cry baby, you cry (You cry) 
When we cry baby, it's like 
You know ohh oh 
How love goes 
Come on say it again 
When I cry baby you cry (Babyyyy) 
When we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh) 
You know (Ohh oh) how love goes 
(Just how love goes) 

If I was a pastor I'd preach for ya girl, 
If I was a hand then I'd reach for ya girl, 
Grab a broom and sweep the streets for ya girl, 
Become the President and get in peace for ya girl, 
I keep having these visions in my mind, 
No since, no reason, no rhyme, 
Schizophrenia is hard to define, 
Life's a mountain for you,I'm ready to climb, 
Become the sun for you I shine, 
Much more than all your other guys combined, 
So you can tell them all to wait in line, 
Coz a crime of passions still a crime, 
Life ain't a movie girl you cant rewind, 
But I play any role just to make you mine, 
Even in the mirror you're one of a kind, 
And I don't need nobody else to co-sign, 

When I cry baby, you cry (You cry) 
When we cry baby, it's like (o o oh o) 
You know (Ohh oh) 
How love goes 
Say it again 
When I cry baby you cry (Woo woo wo ow) 
When we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh) 
You know (Ohh oh) how love goes 
(Just how love goes) 
Take it to the bridge, 

There ain't nothin' I wouldn't do, 
I cook and clean when it comes to you, 
I keep it locked don't ever fear, 
When it comes to my man imma be right here, 
Keep it hustle when times are tough, 
Never left me stranded it was all about us, 
Kept coming home, 
Kept running strong, 
This love is meant to be life long, 

Life is good when it's me and you together, 
And when there's drama then imma do what ever, 
Keep you warm in the stormy cold weather, 
Leave you broken and lonely Oh never, 
Every work that I say is so clever, 
When you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter, 
I am the original go getter, 
I don't waste time fronting I go get her, 
Stare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl, 
Change the way that I think for ya girl, 
Put it on paper waste the ink for ya girl, 
Walk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl, 
Central booking, rock pink for ya girl, 
Step in quicksand and sink for ya girl, 
Whatever the obstacle imma leap for ya girl, 
End my life and go to sleep for ya girl, 

When I cry baby, you cry (You cry) 
When we cry baby, it's like (Yeahh) 
You know you know (Ohh oh) 
How love goes 
When I cry baby you cry 
When we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh) 
You know (Ohh oh) how love goes 
(Just how love goes)
