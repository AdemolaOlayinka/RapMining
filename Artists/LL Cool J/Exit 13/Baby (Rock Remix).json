    "lyrics": "Both hands in the sky, everybody in Giants Stadium put your hands up (baby)\nI feel like I wanna get my Elvis on, on this joint (baby)\nOh yeah, this is serious, oh\n\n\nMet this lil' girl she was off the hook\nI got cold chills when her body shook\nHot Sex on the platter, no need to cook\nI let her steal my heart like a horny crook\nHad her grindin and windin against my leg\nShe fucking with my head, want a nigga to beg\nSexy pumps on, toenails red\nYour body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead\nIt's hard to hold you when you movin vulgar\nPeace sign on your eyes like John Travolta\nMy Pulp ain't Fiction, it's an addiction\nTo see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen\nNasty girl, taught me all the lingo\nWhile mama play bingo, she ride mandingo\nShe don't give a damn if I'm married or single\nShe makes me TINGLE! She wanna be my\n\n\n(Baby) any time of day\nGet off the bus, girl, we running away\nSo you can be my (baby)\nLet's take a roll in the hay\nLet's go out in the yard to play\nYou wanna be my (baby)\nAll night and day\nLet's go, put the books away\nYou gon' be my (baby)\nNothing left to say\nThat'll only take my buzz away, hey, hey\n\n\nShe likes Hip-Hop and Rock & Roll\nHer lifetime goal is a movie role\nShe lookin for a man that could give her a break\nLike Usher or Justin Timberlake\nI'm really not sure if her breasts are fake\nCause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake\nWe drink some beers inside her dad's Camaro\nShe shot me in the back with cupid's arrow\nWe finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back\nPulled up her dress and she made me eat that\nI'm drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty\nTruck stop bathroom at 7:30\nOrder some dessert, muthafuck if it's early\nHead spinnin around like roller derby\nEverything about her says you dont deserve me\nI hope im worthy, for you to be my\n\n\n\n\nIn the back of the pickup clothin ripped up\nHow about a cornfield, shit gets more real\nRunnin and laughin, music blastin\nSide of the road bent over crashing\nMouth all dry, I've been pumping herb\nIf you see my mama, dont say a word\nThe cops wanna know why my words are slurred\nDon't ask me officer ask hurr\nWanna another drink baby she like surr\nWanna hit the club she like I dont curr\nShe all in the rearview doin her hurr\nHairspray and lip gloss everywhurr\nThis all happens on an average day\nYour life is the shit, girl I'm here to stay\nI never had a girl make me feel this way\nEven though I had to pay, you gon' be my\n",
