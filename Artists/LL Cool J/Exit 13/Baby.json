Your baby (HEY!!!)\nYour baby (HEY!!!) Your baby (HEY!!!)\nI'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!\n\n\nMet this lil' girl she was off the hook\nI got cold chills when her body shook\nHot Sex on the platter, no need to cook\nI let her steal my heart like a horny crook\nHad her grindin and windin against my leg\nShe messin with my head, wanna play in the bed\nSexy pumps on, toenails red\nYour body's a gun baby, pump me full of lead\nIt hard to hold you when you movin vulgar\nPeace sign on your eyes like John Travolta\nMy Pulp ain't Fiction, it's an addiction\nto see your booty clap on the floor in the kitchen\nNasty girl, taught me all the lingo\nWhile mama play bingo, she ride mandingo\nShe don't give a damn if I'm married or single\nShe makes me TINGLE! Shorty I'm your.....\n\n\nCause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (HEY!!!) Your baby (HEY!!!)\nYour baby (HEY!!!) Your baby (HEY!!!)\nI'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!\n\n\nShe likes Hip-Hop and R&B\nHer lifetime goal is to be on TV\nShe lookin for a man that could give her a break\nLike Usher or Justin Timberlake\nI'm really not sure if her breasts are fake\nCause with whipped cream on 'em, they taste just like cake\nWe drink some beer inside of daddy's '64\nShe shot me in the back with cupid's arrow\nWe finish the 6-pac, she push the seat back\nPulled up her dress and she let me peep that\nIm Drunk as a skunk, feeling all dirty\nTruck stop bathroom at 7:30\nBought her some dessert, give a damn if it's early\nHead spinnin around like roller derby\nEverything about her says you dont deserve me\nI hope im worthy, cause shorty I'm your...........\n\n\nCause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (HEY!!!) Your baby (HEY!!!)\nYour baby (HEY!!!) Your baby (HEY!!!)\nI'm your baby, your baby, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!\n\n\nYou need somethin like me? (Yeah!)\nCause he ain't nothin like me (No!)\nYou can search but you never 'gon find (No!\nA love that's quite like mine (No!)\nNeed a man that can love you good\nAnd treat you like he should\nWith me shorty you the shit\nHe might be good but he aint like this\nCause im your baby\n\n\nIn the back of the pickup clothin ripped up\nShe see my chrome wheels, it gets more real\nRunnin and laughin, music blastin\nSide over the road bent over crashing\nMouth all dry, I can feel the urge\nIf you see my mama, dont say a word\nThe cops wanna know why my words are slurred\nDont ask me officer ask hurr\nWanna another drink baby she like surr\nWanna hit the club she like I dont curr\nShe all in the rearview doin her hurr\nHairspray and lip gloss everywhurr\nThis all happens on an average day\nYour life is a trip girl i'm here to stay\nNever had a girl make me feel this way\nEven though I had to pay, shorty I'm your....\n\n\nCause I'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby (Your) my baby\nI'm your baby (HEY!!!)
