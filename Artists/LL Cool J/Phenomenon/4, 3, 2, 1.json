I'm already doin a hundred\nwhen I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it\n\n\nStay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down\nRun it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down\nWhen in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that\nSee that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that\nWhere we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?\nDon't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson\nI'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live\nLet me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give\nthan receive, believe what I say when I tell you\nDon't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you\nAnd when the lights is out, they don't come back on\nThis ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong\nYou knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby\nYou'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby\nso I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?\nWant heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat\n\nAiyyo, one two three four\nfive six seven\nBlaze the hot trizack\nShine like heaven\nSeven six five four\nthree two one\nCome on Mr. Smith, come get some!\n\n\nWhen young sons fantasize of borrowing flows\ntell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)\nThe symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers\nYou hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur\nHow dare you step up in my dimension\nYour little ass should be somewher cryin on detention\nWatch your mouth better yet hold your tongue\nI'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun\nBlow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces\nwith one thesis (\"LL Cool J is hard\")\nEvery little boy wanna pick up the mic\nand try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype\nBut that's like pickin up a ball, playin with Mike\nSwingin at Ken Griffey or challengin Roy to a fight\nSnappin, you ameteur MC's\nDon't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin overseas\nFor rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease\nRingmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uhh)\nIn the history of rap they've never seen such prominence\nYour naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)\nNow let's get back to this mic on my arm\nIf it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb\nYou don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize\nAnd you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize\nAnd I'm daring every MC in the game\nto play yourself out position, and mention my name\nI make a rhyme for every syllable in your name\nGo platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train\nWatch your mouth don't ever step out of line\nLL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time\n",
