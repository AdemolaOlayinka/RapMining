You can't afford a cab\nSaid you slapped Rowdy Piper and didn't get a hassle\nYou promised your girl filet mignon, took her to White Castle\nYou said you have a lot of women, you don't even know a few\n'There are 8 million stories' - and they're all made up by you\nThat's a lie\n\n\n...Rush, man\nGives you the biggest medaillon you ever saw\n(You're a liar)\nIt's gon' keep the bullets off your back\n(That's a lie)\nYou know why stations play our records?\nCause the kids'll tear the station apart\nKids'll rip it down...\n\n\nSaid your grandmother's 20 when your mother's 25\nSaid your father beat Joe Lewis, but homebody took a dive\nYou said you used tootpaste, your teeth are yellow like my gold\nA brand new pair of Lee's, that's the skirt your sister stole\nThat's a lie\n\n\nYo man\nAll the girls everywhere talkin about Rush\n(You're a liar)\nWord man, Pretty Tony knocked a hoe down the other day\n(That's a lie)\nTalkin so much about 'Rush, Rush,' every time\n(You're liar)\nThat hoes just be beefin, man\n'Rush this and Rush that'\n(That's a lie)\nWorld's biggest thing, man\nRush is gettin all the money, man\n(You're liar)\n...wheel barrow full of money, ya understand me?\n(That's a lie)\nThat they be rollin that shit in my office all day\n(You're a liar)\nNothin but money, and it be green\n(That's a lie)\nDon't front, man, you know what Rush is about, man\nRush gets money, man\n(You're liar)\nMy Maserati is bad, man, it's blue and green - and gold\n(That's a lie)\nI just bought this hoe this milllion dollar ring, man\n(You're a liar)\nI just wanna look good, man\nSo I got one\n(That's a lie)\nLike that, we be cold gettin money at Rush, man\nJewels be them thangs\n(You're a liar)\nRings and things, man, all that type of stuff\n(That's a lie)\nMan, I got 900 pairs of Reeboks, man\n...pair of...Adidas\n(You're a liar)\nI got every color of Adiddas they ever made, man\n(That's a lie)\nMy man Steve, that's a porno star, man\nAnd he be bringin them hoes to the house\n(You're a liar)\nWord man, they be over my house\n(That's a lie)\nYo, that girl at my house, man\n...Lee, man\nShe cleans up behind me, man\n(You're a liar)\nYo, she cleans up behind me, does everything I say, man\n(That's a lie)\nYo man, sweet little Japanese thing, man\nTakin care of me, man\n(You're a l-)\nYo, man...\n(That's a lie)\n",
