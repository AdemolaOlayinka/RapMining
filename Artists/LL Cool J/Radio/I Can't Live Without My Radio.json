    "lyrics": "My radio, believe me, I like it loud\nI'm the man with a box that can rock the crowd\nWalkin' down the street, to the hardcore beat\nWhile my JVC vibrates the concrete\nI'm sorry if you can't understand\nBut I need a radio inside my hand\nDon't mean to offend other citizens\nBut I kick my volume way past 10\nMy story is rough, my neighbourhood is tough\nBut I still sport gold, and I'm out to crush\nMy name is Cool J, I devastate the show\nBut I couldn't survive without my radio\nTerrorising my neighbours with the heavy bass\nI keep the suckas in fear by the look on my face\nMy radio's bad from the Boulevard\nI'm a hip-hop gangster and my name is Todd\nJust stimulated by the beat, bust out the rhyme\nGet fresh batteries if it won't rewind\nCos I play everyday, even on the subway\nI woulda got a summons but I ran away\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\n\n\nSuckas on my jock when I walk down the block\nI really don't care if you're jealous or not\nCos I make the songs, you sing along\nAnd your radio's def when my record's on\nSo get off the wall, become involved\nAll your radio problems have now been solved\nMy treacherous beats make ya ears respond\nAnd my radio's loud like a fire alarm\nThe floor vibrates, the walls cave in\nThe bass makes my eardrums seem thin\nDef sounds in my ride, yes the front and back\nYou would think it was a party, not a Cadillac\nCos I drive up to the ave, with the windows closed\nAnd my bass is so loud, it could rip your clothes\nMy stereo's thumpin' like a savage beast\nThe level on my power meter will not decrease\nSuckas get mad, cos the girlies scream\nAnd I'm still gettin' paid while you look at me mean\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n\n\nDon't touch that dial, I'll be upset\nMight go into a fit and rip off your neck\nCos the radio's thumpin' when I'm down to play\nI'm the royal chief rocker LL Cool J\nLet your big butt bounce from right to left\nCos it's a actual fact this jam is def\nMost definitely created by me\nGoin' down in radio history\nI'm good to go on your radio\nAnd I'm cold gettin' paid cos Rick said so\nMake the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch\nSome jealous knuckleheads might try to dis\nBut it's nuthin', ya frontin', ya girl I am stuntin'\nAnd my radio's loud enough to keep you gruntin'\nMy name is Cool J, I'm from the rock\nCirculating through your radio non-stop\nI'm lookin' at the wires behind the cassette\nAnd now I'm on the right, standing on the eject\nWearin' light blue Pumas, a whole lotta gold\nAnd jams like these keep me in control\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nAnd I know I can't live without my radio\n\n\n\nYour energy level starts to increase\nAs my big beat is slowly released\nI'm on the radio and at the jam\nLL Cool J is who I am\nImma make ya dance, boogie down and rock\nAnd you'll scratch and shake to my musical plot\nAnd to expand my musical plan\nCut Creator, rock the beat with your hands\n\nThat's right, so don't try to front the move\nAs you become motivated by the funky groove\nYou can see me and Earl chillin' on the block\nWith my box cold kickin' with the gangster rock\nSee people can't stop me, neither can the police\nI'm a musical maniac to say the least\nFor you and your radio I made this for\nCool J's here to devastate once more\nPullin' all the girls, takin' out MCs\nIf ya try to disrespect me, I just say Please!\nHere to command the hip-hop land\nKick it live with a box inside my hand\nI'm the leader of the show, keepin' you on the go\nBut I know I can't live without my radio\n\nFarmers Boulevard, yeah, you know that's where me and E hang out, cool\nout, you know what I'm sayin'? That's where the crib's at.\n",
