Look at my body, coulda been a Navy Seal\nBut you lack the discipline to do what I do\nReinvention, I'm in the 11th dimension\nI'm a value stock pop, get it while it's hot\nCause once I blow, I'ma split and that's it\n\n\n\n\nAiyyo E it's one o'clock\nTime to get one and bounce baby\nIt's time to get one and bounce, you know what time it is\n\nYour honor, last week he punched me in my face\nI want twenty million, you know he liftin weights\nLast week, me and the President was takin flicks\nLast week, my video dropped and you was sick\nLast week, I copped my lil' shorty some kicks\nthat cost 29 hundred, homey you don't want it\nMy ears stay flooded like your man stay blunted\nMy American Express is Black, I'm at the Summit\nThe Benjamin Grier of Def Jam, y'all know\nMy po'tfolio was sicker than polio\nFor real God is good, he took me out the hood\nGot me livin in a mansion like a big boy should\nAnd I never do Cribs, I ain't gonna have y'all fruitcakes\nknowin how I live, bed extra big\nYou sit around, run your mouth, POTbelly on the couch\nClaimin you hot but honey what you wove out\nWhen she alone, pump L, I make her bounce\nYou on the corner riskin your life to sell a ounce\nWish you was Pablo, lay in the carbo\nWith a chick named Margo who flew from Chicago\nBut no, in real life cats catch it\nIt's not what you expected huh? Life kinda hectic huh?\n\n\n\n\nYeah yeah\nIt's the definition\nDefinition\nDefinition potna, eleven in a row!\n",
