If the broad is thirsty\nI'll have her man reimburse me\nThe part that hurts me, is when they try to work me\nBut I could never let ya jerk me\nSteady sticking to the wall, give it up\nSneaking through the back door live it up\nGot the champagne, pour me a cup\nGot the girls looking raw in the front\nGot a call your man's in town\nTell the bar, a-nother round\nGot all my mans holding me down\nKinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it\nI'm saying what time wanna dip wit it?\nGot playas on the grind, wanna skip wit it\nBackstage you mine, I'm a spit wit it, hey!\n\n\n\n\nHey ladies! (Yeah!) no need to get your hair done\nI said yo ladies! (Yeah!) no need to get your hair done\nI'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung\nI'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung\nI said yo fellas ((Yo!)) no need to throw them ones\nI said yo fellas ((Yo!)) no need to throw them ones\nI'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung\nI'm a get your head sprung, I'm a get your head sprung (Hey!)\n\n\n\n\nYeah! Keep chillin wit em, yeah\n",
