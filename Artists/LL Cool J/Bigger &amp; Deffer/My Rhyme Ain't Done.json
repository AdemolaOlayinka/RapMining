    "lyrics": "The President woke and he called the Pope\nThe Pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope\nP.S. the Lord raised Michaelangelo from the dead\nSo he can make a fresh painting of my head\nThen I hung out with a king and a queen\nAnd the queen put me down with her polo team\nThe way I scored points all around the clock\nI had her daughter, the princess ridin my jock\nI knocked the freak off like a crazy retard\nThen I took a little trip into a deck of cards\nThe diamond jack joker and the ace of spades\nWas amazed at greater Cut Creator on the fade\nThen I played cards with the queen of clubs\nThe queen of hearts with me cold fell in love\nAs for the queen of diamonds, she don't like men\nBecause you know that a diamond is a girl's best friend\nThe double-trouble spade was named the deuce\nAnd the joker acted stupid, so we gave him the news\nThere was 52 cards, and I met everyone\nThat story is over, but my rhyme ain't done\n\n\nThen I took a trip to the center of the earth\nI was kinda scared, so E-Love went first\nI met these funny little people, they called em skeezers\nSo I held on to my wallet like Ebeneezer\nTight leather pants that'll make you grunt\nTwo nice soft things right up front\nThe center of the earth ain't got no crime\nJust people bodyrockin to the L.L. rhyme\nIf you're kinda confused to what a skeezer is\nIt's just a girl who's on my jock cause I'm in showbiz\nThere was a whole lotta skeezers, I dogged everyone\nThat story is over, but my rhyme ain't done\n\n\nWoke up late one afternoon\nRealized I was in the world of cartoons\nHe-Man told me he'd beat me up\nBecause he thought that I looked like Donald Duck\nThen I hung out with Spiderman\nHe told me he was gonna start a comic strip band\nThe Incredible Hulk was gonna play the drums\nCharlie Brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum\nSnoopy tried to rock on the microphone\nBut Tom & Jerry both said he should leave it alone\nThen I hung out with Mickey Mouse\nHe had two freaks, so we went to his house\nMickey's freak was ugly, but mine was def\nSo I knocked it off until there wasn't none left\nThey were cartoon characters, I met everyone\nThat story is over, but my rhyme ain't done\n\n\nSince I'm a good friend of father time\nI'm not gettin older as I say this rhyme\nI was warmin the stove at the Alamo\nBefore Booth shot Lincoln I stole the show\nI was down with George at the Delaware\nBut I wore a Kangol, not the fake white hair\nMe and E-Love met Sitting Bull\nWe made a peace pipe, then we took a pull\nThen he brought more leaves from a golden chest\nYou thought it was tabacco - the shit was cess\nThere was a lotta great men, and I met everyone\nThat story is over, but my rhyme ain't done\n\n\n11:33, I swear it's no sooner\nI went inside my TV, I met _The Honeymooners_\nRalph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes\nBut I had my eyes on Alice's behind\nNorton came down right about that time\nLookin in the frigde, so he could swine and dine\nThen I said to myself, I should give em a taste\nSo I pulled the microphone out my black briefcase\nSaid, it ain't Bob Hope or Barry Manilow\nThen I borrowed Norton's hat, cause I forgot my Kangol\nRalph said, \"I got a scheme, let me get to it\"\n\"Norton, my pal,\" I said, \"Yo, don't even do it\"\nThey were all Honeymooners, and I met everyone\nThat story is over, but my rhyme ain't done\n\n\nCause my tongue cuts sharp, I hit a note like a harp\nOr a harmonica, Veronica, I do my part\nIn a bedroom with leg room I'm strong like a monsoon\nChilled in Maui-Waui and I carry a harpoon\nStopped at the isle that's Mali, cause we got ill\nWrote my name on a rock at the top of the hill\nI searched for other ways, made love in caves\nAnd I kicked the ill beats that make the natives raise\nNow I'm gonna tell you what all this means\nFrom Farmers Boulevard in St. Albans, Queens\nThere's a lyrical technician who came to play\nNumber one b-boy L.L. COOL J\nAll of this is just a story that I made up\nDef lines I say on time with Cut Creator's cuts\nSome of it's fiction, and some of it's fact\nNot another common rap with a heavy drum track\nA whole lotta rhymes, and I wrote everyone\nThat story is over, and my rhyme IS DONE\nHUH!\n",
