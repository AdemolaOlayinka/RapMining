ROCK, ROCK around the clock\nThree years ago in St. Albans, Queens\nI was rockin at a park called one eighteen\nLittle kids stood and watched as I rocked the spot\nDidn't know that years later I'll be standin on top\nLivin near Farmers Boulevard I was born and base-shaw\nStopped the rich and shaked hands with the poor\nAnd this is a story about a brother I know\nCut Creator on the fader no watch him go\n\n\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\n\n\nWhen back in the days before I clocked some dough\nI used to go to the show and sit in the front row\nHopin and prayin one day I'll get on the road\nSo I had a feeler and a summer and I meet when I'm stoned\nNot fearin a thought, got stung like a horse\nDon't make fun of my posse, cause each man is a boss\nWhen his only damn way to pull a jam out the crate\nOne time for your mind\nCheck out the guitar break\n\n\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\n\n\nThis jam just wasn't enough for Jimmy Hendrix to see\nHe could do lessons of mixin take you under his wing\nStraight from the heart cause it ain't the money that we came here for\nAin't no thoughts in the room ain't breakin no roles\nAnd in the Rock 'n' Roll land, a big strivin plan\nJust my posse learn the vocals what little they had\nIt's all about us three: Eve, Phil & Jay\nHe heard Cut Creator cut now check it out to play\n\n\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\n\n\nRock, rock y'all check out the funky cut\nIt's like travellin through time to the straight cats strut\nCuts are slicker than Grease needle as sharp as a knife\nWe'll be do doin the doo for the rest of the lines\nWanna piece of the action, it's time to party, get up\nNot a subway bummy singer puttin change in a cup\nWanna see you boogie, oogie jumpin up and down\nBitin your livin hold your breath until we come to your town\nL-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S\nCut Creator cut the record for me\n\n\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\n\nL-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S\n\n\nGo, go, go, go, ahh, go\n\n\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo, go Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\nGo Cut Creator Go\n\nL-L-C-O-O-L-J-I-S-H-A-R-D-A-S-H-E-L-L\n",
