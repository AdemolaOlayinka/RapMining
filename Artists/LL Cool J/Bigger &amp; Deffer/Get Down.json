Cool J\nRhymes are all wack and real all real\nYo Earl, tell the party people the deal\n\n\nYo listen here\nYa ain't no thing, can't complain\nThey catch like a muh'fuck pass to J\n\n\nThat's right I'm back he's talks how to rap\nHe used to Smurf now you're jackin cause my name's on the map\nSit and lie my homeboy Earl says is that he loves hats\nWith a hands like a hatcher, Cut Creators in bat\nCut Creator on the fader the teachers pet\nBaddest man with ten fingers you've ever met\nAnd sooner or later we'll have to sit\nCut Creator cut the record so they don't forget\nGet down\n\n\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L.\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L.\n\n\nI make hard rock jams for hard rock fans\nWhat I'm sayin is for real this ain't lala land\nGot a can full of jams pullin off the lid\nCompetition in New York is doin what I did\nCold sender of a story I paid my dues\nI rocked at house parties I was down with crews\nNow I'll never be caught I'm on my P's and Q's\nAnd for the rest of your life you wanna be in my shoes\nI scar like stones hard like cement and I rocked every jam that I ever went\nCause I got a better reppin than any emcee has\nAnd I'm down like a brother from Alcatraz\nGet down\n\n\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L.\nGet Down\nGo L.L., go L.L., go L.L.\n\n\nNi-ni-nigga-nigga-ni-ni-ni-ninja\nI rap the boss is back the only man\nyou should call when the party's packed\nFrom Paris to L.A they say I'm as sharp as a pin\nWhen it's a Cool J party you gotta get in\nSo I'm makin big steps like Gladys Knight in the pier\nOne rhyme you're on my tensils as I leave my lip\nUp the block kids are talkin and spreadin the news\nAbout the new grandmaster the one you'll choose\nCause I'm chuckling I wanna stomp the rest\nWhen I kick it couldn't bore it could only impress\nI'm not a Hula-Hoop this isn't a passin phase\nHard work pays I'm gettin straight up A's\nCool J is runnin things I want it understood\nExecutioner I should wear a black hood\nAnd carry an axe cause I'm ruff on wax\nSpeakers speakin ?phone-wear from durable? eight-tracks\nGet down\n\n(G, G, G, G, G, G, Get Down)\n",
