(Jamaica, Queens!)\n\n\n\nI seen her standin' there, slutty as could be\nOffering the putty for a itty-bitty fee\nEvery red light she'll come over to your ride\nOr she's standin' in the doorway tellin' you to come inside\nThe Bristol Hotel, cos it ain't no thing\nAnd her meat tastes better than Burger King\nJapanese executives in three-piece suits\nGlasses all foggy when they come in the place\nThe girlies in the Bristol, they're all in cahoots\nHe fell asleep and got robbed, and cold chumped his face at the...\n\n\n\n\n\nParty people check the story cos the story is ill\nIt's the story of two men, one Harold, one Bill\nThey went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night\nHarold was cool but Bill felt uptight\nThe girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool\n\"Never ever rush, that's the golden rule\nI been comin' to the Bristol's ten years of my life\nA-yo, what the hell?
