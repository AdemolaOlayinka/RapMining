ah yeah
I wanna send this one out to all the jeep lovers worldwide
city to city, ghetto to ghetto
some flavor for you and yours
and your jeep

you're the type of girl that got class and style
still in all you need the backseat of my jeep once in a while
so I pull up to your door to give you what you're looking for
unh, hardcore
I know you wanna come...in my jeep
we can park on a back street
you're checkin' out my carphone, scopin' out my jewelry
let's do this in a hurry
air freshener is kickin', drive through for chicken
I know you need a good stickin'
that's when I see my man Snoop
peace, what up kid? loungin' duke
as I turn the corner, starin' in your cornier
you're gettin' hornier and hornier
I'm pumpin' up a blint tape (flavor)
you're legs is incredible, I do a double take
you're puttin' on your lipstick
I wanna give you this big fat...(yeeeaaa)
quick, I know a place where we can lounge and cool, don't sleep
(where at?) back seat of my jeep


back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
back seat of my jeep, let's swing an episode
back seat of my jeep, let's swing an ep'

I'm pullin' over near your building
I light a candle on the dashboard, we're chillin'
I knew a girl like you would love a scene like this
you got class but deep down you're real freakish
you got it all, but you never had a wild episode
that's when me and my jeep showed
up with the funk in the trunk and
hittin' it, we're spunkin'
I'll even get you drunk and tipsy
'cause I know you're feelin' frisky
you love it 'cause it's wild and risky
you got your eyes on the hood
you're up to no good
I took you in the back, you hoped I would
you got your black on black so stacked in the back
while I'm pumpin' in the CD I'll skip a track
windows are foggy
and, uh, back seat treats in the streets could be a hobby
and you ain't in between the Isley Brothers' sheets
I give it to you real raw in the backseat
that's how you want it, don't ya? (yeah)
you'll tell your girlfriends, won't ya? (nah)
don't lie 
take it in your eye (why?)
so buckle up, buckle up
what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? what's my name? huh
I never knew a four wheel drive could be so live
I'll put your numbers in the archives
so take 'em off, and put them things on the mirror girl
it's my jeep and your world
you got it going on lovely, time to do the right thing
'cause I can tell you wanna swing



we're bonin' on the dark blocks
wearin' out the shocks, wettin' up the dashboard clock
seats full of sweat, I told ya I would hit it
your kitty, kitty, cat, cat, was hungry so I fed it
workin' as a team
somebody, anybody 
jump with me to the cash bar
I'll be like Bruce Lee in them skins goin' "waahhh"
damn, it's so good, the mad grip on my tip
you're still a nice girl but my jeep makes ya flip
you go wild and stick your toes on the roof (yeah yeah)
you're so cute, wit' your gold tooth
exstentions on the carpet
that nice round brown is my target
it's so firm, so cushy, it makes me feel mushy
I love it when it's pushy
but don't laugh, I'm serious with this (word up)
the back seat of my jeep, is priceless
you're climaxin', you're climaxin', it's full action
you love a good waxin', it's so relaxin'

unh, give me a hug
see what I'm sayin' love?
