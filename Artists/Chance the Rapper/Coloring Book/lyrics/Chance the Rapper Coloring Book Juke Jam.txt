We used to roll at the rink
We used to roll at the rink
I used to talk way too much
You used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry 'bout Frooties and Trues
Till I found out all of the shawtys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rolling with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe (juke)
I'm crazy (juke)

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stopped skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe, I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
And we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up for the weekend
Rollin with your party
So tell me what you thinkin'
Say we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to, I remember you cause

We've got so much history baby (juke)
Maybe (juke)
