    "lyrics": "After a long night of drinking and partying with fast women, with his good friend El-P, Justin goes home to get some good rest. He turns on the TV, and it's Cat Week. What's the worst that could go wrong?\n\nHold up\n(Oh my)\n\nFuck the law; they can eat my dick, that's word to Pimp\nI don't fuck with or talk, like all these fuckin' imps\nStyle violent, give a fuck if you deny it, kids\nYou can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks\nFuck the world; don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G\nI dreamt we owned the world, but I've woken up, and it don't exist\nSoak it in, I need no assist, you can't slap my wrist, I don't owe you shit\nTrust me, I'm a Doctor DOOM, oper-ate of my pulse, won't raise a bit\n\nTip-toe on the track like a ballerina; ski mask in a Pontiac Catalina\nIt's obese, female opera singer; you can run the jewels or lose your fingers\nMe and El-P got time to kill, got folks to kill on overkill\nHe hangin' out the window; I hold the wheel, one black, one white, we shoot to kill (Oh my God!)\nThat fuckboy life about to be repealed; that fuckboy shit about to be repelled\nFuckboy Jihad, kill infidels, Allah Akbar, BOOM, from Mike and El\n\nLife is hell, death's a bitch, and these fubar rulers getting rich\nI cop a zip, it opens up, I smoke it up, go home, and fuck\nC'est la vie, girl, when in Rome; I gave the face, please pay with dome\nMy business card says, \"You're in luck; I do two things: I rap and fuck.\"\n\nI fuck and rap, I tote the strap, I smoke the kush, I beat the puss\nI read the books, did the math, don't need a preacher preachin', on my behalf\nNo teacher can teach, my arrogant ass, I'm blowin' on crippy, while readin' inscriptions\nThat's written by Egyptians, and sippin' on whiskey! Aye baby, you with me?\n\n(Where am I? What is this? What are these- What are these cats doing?! What are they doing?! Stop, please, no! STOP!)\nOh my, don't cry\n\nWe run this spot, like a Chinese sweatshop\nDon't stop, work it, work, it 'til chest pop - Cardiac arrested\nI'm so invested, I'm self-invented, that no illusion, there's no confusion\nYou see the future, you fear the future, I've seen the truth, and I'm so deluded\nI've... Been a better bad guy, than I been, better than bad\nBeen a bit a bully talk, beating in my chest, in fact\nI'm a half stack, from a rack, I been around the block, babe, I know a few facts\nManiac, brainiac, run go, tell them that, ATLien, NY felon rap\n\nHandle me wrong, I'm snappin'; show up at your class, what's happenin'?\nSchoolyard bully, with a fully automatic, heart full of pain and a head, full of havoc\nEverybody stepped on the kid, and I'm letting them have it\nHavoc, Leaving they momma, to say, \"What happened!?\nWho gon' buy my baby a casket?\" Fuck that bitch, I'm a bastard\n\nMegablast, I'm mega lit, on Highway 6, and I'm not strapped in\nI don't crash, bitch, I just skid, you got the cash? I'll make the trip\nI make the trip, you better pay, done worse for less, don't make my day\nI'm not from Earth, from far away, I bust through chests, like baby greys\n\nRunnin' the jewels of the game, whippin' the mix is, like chickens of 'caine\nSpittin' the sentence again, parents is livid again, kids is just fuckin' insane\nPointin' that pistol and fist, for the chain, reppin' the symbol, like they in a gang\nDelivery dope, like a dosage of dope, or a noseful of coke, for a junkie, or fiend\n\n(God, I promise I will never hang out with the Run the Jewels again! El-P, what the fuck did you do to my ?)\nDon't cry\n(Why is fucking cats screaming at me?!)\nOh my\n(STOP!)\nDon't cry\n(What the FUCK do you mean, \"Don't cry?! \")\n",
