Champ! So what we're gonna do next?\n\nI'm up at midnight, I'm dippin' off in my Nizzikes\nA gun and a metal pizzipe, a knizzife is to my rizzight\nI'm lurkin' servin' on pussies who lack a purpose\nI've got 'em filled up with frizzight like Mizzike is you all rizzight?\nI'm lookin' lurkin' on bitches twerkin' for service\nThe bitches bag is a Birkin, I'm yellin', screamin' and cursin'\nI'm putting pistols in faces at random places like\nBitch, give it up or stand adjacent to Satan\nBad man chillin', the villains is here\nNo Jesuses here, I hear the demons in my ear\nAnd I want it, I need it, see it, I take it\nNever fake it, wrap you motherfuckers up, leave you naked\nThe jewel runners, top tag team for two summers\nLive and let live, fuck you cause cause that's a fool's honor\nI'm walkin' totin' on two llamas\nYou niggas ass and trash and trash, fuck it, I'm too honest\nSo fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely\nAnd that's about the psyche of Jaime and Mikey\nYou meet another pair better - highly unlikely\nAnd if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me\nI live for the thrill of the kill, yes it excites me\nYou know your favorite rapper ain't shit and me, I might be\nThe closest representation of God you might see\nPay honors like your momma young sonna and take a right knee\nThe passion of Pac, the depth of Nas, circa nine three\nMix the mind of Brad Jordan and Chuck D and find me\nI spit with the diction of Malcolm or say a Bun B\nPrevail through Hell, so Satan get ye behind me\n\nThe kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food\nThe kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food\nThe kitten became a lion that look at your face like...\n(Meow the Jewels)\n\nI've never been much of shit, by most measurements don't exist on the radar a little blip in the shadow of motherships\nBeen smothered and brashly muffled by hucksters of global spin like the sign on my back says \"stab me\", my soul is your little bitch\nBut maybe you should be careful when flipping a stranger's switch like assuming the war is won ain't a symptom of arrogance\nWhen nothing to lose a step up then everything's for the win so we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dick\nI live to spit on your grave, my existence is to disgrace you\nThe kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food\nThat's why we got the people behind us\nWhile other rappers are vaginas for the fame the jewel runners will always stay rude\nMotherfuck your permission\nWas never yours to begin with\nAnd every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fucking prison\nI been here making raw shit and never asked to be lauded\nRun the Jewels is the answer, your question is \"what's poppin'?\"\n",
