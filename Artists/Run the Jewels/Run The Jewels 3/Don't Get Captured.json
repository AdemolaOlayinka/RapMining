Oh well, hell, so's this boot\nWe live to hear you say \"please don't shoot\"\nA pure delight, c'mon, make my night\nWhen I file reports what's right's what I write\nSnuff films air all night 'till your last sane thought take flight\nWhat a great sight, what a job, what a good life\nThe more we act wrong the more we are right\nAnd who exactly gon' stop what we got?\nWe don't argue, we are not calm and impartial\nSome call it work, but it's more like an art\nWe just paint the walls with your heart\nAnd we better not catch you\n\nHe in here, me in here, we in here\n(Don't get captured)\nNo cryin' here, just do your dirt and disappear\n(Don't get captured)\nThen lay it low, take it slow and reappear\n(Don't get captured)\nReturn to us victorious, smoke pounds of kush\n(Don't get captured)\n\nDon't get captured\n(Don't get captured)\nDon't get captured\n(Don't get captured)\nDon't get captured\n(Don't get captured)\n",
