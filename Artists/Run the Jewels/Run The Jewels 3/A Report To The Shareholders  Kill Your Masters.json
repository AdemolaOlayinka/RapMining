    "lyrics": "Beware of horses\nI mean a horse is a horse of course, but who rides is important\nSitting high with a uniform, barking orders, demanding order\nAnd I'm scared that I talk too much about what I think's going on\nI got a way with this, they might drag me away for this\nPut me in a cage for this, I might pay for this\nI just say what I want like I'm made for this\nBut I'm just afraid some days I might be wrong\nMaybe that's why me and Mike get along\nHey, not from the same part of town, but we both hear the same sound coming\n(Woo!)\nAnd it sounds like war\n(Woo!)\nAnd it breaks our hearts\nWhen I started this band, didn't have no plans, didn't see no arc\nJust run with the craft, have a couple laughs\nMake a buck and dash, yeah\nGet a little dap like \"Yeah I'm the fucking man! \", yeah\nMaybe give a little back like, \"Here, I do what I can\"\nIt's all jokes and smoke 'till the truth start schemin'\nCan't contain the disdain for y'all demons\nYou talk clean and bomb hospitals\nSo I speak with the foulest mouth possible\nAnd I drink like a Vulcan losing all faith in the logical\nI will not be confused for docile\nI'm free, motherfuckers, I'm hostile\n\nChoose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon' win\nIt could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again\nBut we know we all afraid, so we just simply cry and march again\nAt the Dem Conven my heart broke apart when I seen them march mommas in\nAs I rap this verse right now, got tears flowing down my chocolate skin\nTold the truth and I've been punished for it, must be a masochist 'cause I done it again\nOoh, Mike said \"uterus\", they acting like Mike said \"You a bitch\"\nTo every writer who wrote it, misquoted it\nMike says, \"You a bitch, you a bitch, you a bitch!\"\nAdd a \"nigga\" for that black writer that started that sewer shit\nI maneuver through manure like a slumdog millionaire\nEl-P told me, \"Fuck them devils, Mike, we gon' be millionaires\"\nI respond with a heavy \"Yeah\"\nBig bro says \"Fuck that, toughen up\nStay ready, write raw raps, shit rugged rough\"\nThe devil don't sleep, us either\nEl spits fire, I spit ether\nWe the gladiators that oppose all Caesars\nComing soon on a new world tour\nProbably play the score for the World War\nAt the apocalypse, play the encore\nTurn around, see El, and I smile\nHell coming and we got about a mile\nUntil it's over I remain hostile...\n\n\nMere mortals, the Gods coming so miss me with the whoopty-whoop\nYou take the devil for God, look how he doin' you\nI'm Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth\nI'm Tiger Flowers with a higher power, hallelu'\nLife'll get so bad it feel like God mad at you\nBut that's a feeling, baby, ever lose, I refuse\nI disabuse these foolish fools of they foolish views\nI heard the revolution coming, you should spread the news\nGarvey-mind, Tyson-punch, this is bad news\nSo feel me, follow me\nDevil done got on top of me\nBad times got a monopoly\nGive up, I did the opposite\nPitch perfect, did it properly\nOwner killed by his property\n\nThis life'll stress you like Orson Welles on the radio\nWar after war of the world'll make all your saneness go\nAnd these invaders from Earth're twerkin' on graves you know\nCan't wait to load up the silos and make your babies glow\nIt's so abusive you'll beg somebody to roofie you\nThey'll snatch your hope up and use it like it's a hula-hoop\nAnd it's a loop, they talk to you just like their rulers do\nThese fucking fools have forgotten just who been fooling who\n\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\n\nKiller children of men on the throne roving with no atonement\nGot me feeling like I'm Clive Owen rowing through a future frozen\nBut the flow is a burning wind, blowing to your coast and\nNow in cages 'cause we rode the waves of your explosions\nDone appealing to our killers, man, to stop the bleeding\nThis song's a dirty bomb for they dirty dealings\nBoots on the roof, I'm Charley Mingus dumping through the ceiling\nMaster P-ing on these lost Europeans thievin'\nShit be grim, and De La born a reaper\nBorn in the beast and fixin' feast tearin' its features\nThe world surges, the nation's nervous\nThe crowds awaken, they can't disperse us\nWe ain't at your service, won't stay sedated\nWon't state our numbers for names and remain faceless\nWe dignified, they can't erase us\nWe ain't asleep, we rope a dope through the flames\nMan, the world gonna ride on what's implied in the name\nRun 'em\n\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\nKill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-\nKill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-\nKill your masters\n",
