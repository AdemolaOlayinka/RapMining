I'm the man bitch, got big ideas, got plans to rob\nAny Rothschild living, Bill Gates and the ghost of Jobs\nYeah I said it, I meant it, I ain't flinchin, Marshawn Lynchin' it\nRun through a motherfucker's face like ig'nant, isn't it\nDomain eminent, we the preeminant\nVillainous willingness, spitting this ready raw rap shit rhyme ridiculous\nEnemy grave he digging it, then we piss in it\nUs go to hell, we been in it, gettin' it, yeah\nBumaye\nBumaye\nBumaye\nBumaye\n\nAye, aye kids\nI'm the fucking tits, I hold no regard for no fucking myth, hey\nI lived half my life to give half my cash to these half man imps\nThey got half a heart, they give half a fuck, they got half the guns\nI got half an hour, I'll burn half a pound and I have to run\nKillers of the earth get scared\nYou do not get one word\nYou do not live for the heard\nEven you living's absurd, better off kicked to the curb\nThat is my word\nBack in the Berenstein timeline zip, no wins for the kid oh shit I got curved\nIn the Berenstain riff, I'm a Biff, so sick when the clock is lit, the whip swerve\nIt's like nothin' not broke, can't stand the scope in the booth\nI disrobe like pederast pope on a play-date\nBetter call may day, baby I'll spray, I'm an AK\nThey flayed and plated, I'm serving dead meat fame to table\nCain to Abel, death's apprentice\nRun the Jewels'll make last breaths Brexit\nBumaye\nBumaye\nBumaye\nBumaye\n\nWord architect, when I arch the tech, I'll part ya' neck\nGot bars on deck, that Xanax flow, make you nod your head\nLike a gram of blow, you inject\nMy words infect like insects havin' incest, I'm in check, like pay day on a Thursday and it's Wednesday\nI'm sensei, you bouquet, you menstruate\nThat's pussy all on your template, we skate, skate on 'em twenty-eight\nGet pearl tongue like every day, so I Run them Jewels in every state\nI kill a mic with Killer Mike, roll el's out a p with El-P\nMy self-esteem on king, got head so big no crown can't fit me\nNo bitch on my ding-a-ling when she ride on it she wet like a jet-ski\nPlease be alarmed, be warned\nPlease be alarmed, be warned\nGive up that charm or get harmed\nWatch, too or your time gone, and the rings or your life pawned and we gone\nYou made my eardrums bleed and I will pinch you\n",
