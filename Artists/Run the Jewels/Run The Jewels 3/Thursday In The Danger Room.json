    "lyrics": "Right for a right, wrong for a wrong\nThis is clearly not life's design\nFigure out quickly that nothing gets answered\nWhen you ask the universe why\nLife is a journey, to live is to worry\nTo love is to lose your damn mind\nBut living's a blessing so I am not stressing\n'Cause some of my friends ain't survived\nThat's the release, but in much bigger pieces, I'm living on limited time\nLike how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they're dying?\nHow do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone?\nNot because you didn't love 'em but just because you felt too weak to be strong\nYou couldn't bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak\nYou prove to your randomness, hold it for ransom, that life will not fade in your dreams\nYou see that they're fighting and know that they're losing but still you make jokes and you laugh\n'Cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last\nNow every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it's in the past\nAnd when they all gone you just try to move on 'cause the memory's hurting too bad\nGrown up so much and I wonder who you'd've become if you stuck for a while\nJust know that I love you, good friend, ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile\n\nAnd I guess I'd say I'll see you soon\nBut the truth is that I see you now\nStill talk to you like you're around\nAnd I guess I say you left too soon\nBut the truth is that you never left\n'Cause I never let myself forget\n\nAn eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth\nWill leave us all mumbling and blind\nSo we stumble blind through depths of the dark\nLooking for something divine\nLife is a journey, to live is to suffer\nAnd I have been suffering through mine\nBut living's a blessing so I ain't no stressing\n'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round\nHe got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin'\nI searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind\nI tell her that it'll be fine\nBut deep down I know that I'm lying\nThe family came took rings and his chains\nThe bank took the house and the rights\nThe only thing left was his child, and she had a smile in his eyes\nSo much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her, she'd look at her sometime and cry\nThe very next day she cried\nAnd day after day she cried\nThen called baby mama and told her \"I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried\"\nNo killer was captured, but I know he listening\nSo I'd like to tell you in song\nThe streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it, I hope that you righted your wrongs\nI hope that you learn, I hope that you changed so your mama won't know this pain\nSo my homie's name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain\n\nAnd I guess I'd say I'll see you soon\nBut the truth is that I see you now\nStill talk to you like you're around\nAnd I guess I say you left too soon\nBut the truth is that you never left\n'Cause I never let myself forget\n",
