This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one\n\n(Conversing with a ghost, conversing with a ghost)\nHe just leaving and he screamin' Jesus\n(He had the highest hopes, he had the highest hopes)\nPeople yelling, screamin' at polices\n(Riots tonight, riots tonight)\nBurnin', lootin', shootin', takin', thievin'\n(Fire and light, fire and light)\nFill the air and most don't know the reason\n(Never knew his name, never knew his name)\nBut they know his problems and feel his pain\n(Shit's still the same, shit's still the same)\nWe just prey off in they deadly game\n(It'll never change, it'll never change)\nToo much profit in it and it stay the same\n(The facts still remain, the facts still remain)\nYou can burn the system and start again\n\n(Spoke with a ghost)\nLate night, same night, \"God, let me sleep, please, I'm begging you\"\n(Said don't be afraid)\nDaylight might never break right again once they get at you\n(Said you'll never be alone again)\nThis house is haunted by pain transposed into revenue\n(The murdered all stay)\nThat thing when your mind says \"Run!\" but your heart isn't letting you\n(Said we got an army now)\nYou strike 'em down, still they live inside hearts, hearts carry them\n(The weapon is our memory)\nSome get to count sheep, some gotta count kids that they burying\n(I don't wanna scare nobody)\nFears been law for so long that rage feels like therapy\n(But I'm gonna make 'em remember me)\nNobody gets no more sleep till we teach them remembering\nThieves!\nThieves!\n\nComing live at five, we got new news breaking\nYou heard here first if you don't die waiting\nHard to review the scene I just seen\nI'm a try to convey, but it defies explaining\nStarted with folks just crying\nNothing but broken heart sobs and the shriek of the sirens\nRight at the spot where the blood's still drying\nThen (My God) I saw it, the dead began rising\nI don't know much about science\nBut I seen an army of armed men stop and get quiet\nMist hung low like a prayer from a tyrant\nSky became black like the stars aren't aligning\nSo many years of this violence\nNow we're surrounded by the souls of the dead and defiant\nSaying \"Look what you've done, you designed it\"\nWhen the bough breaks, hear the wraith scream, \"Riot!\"\n\nNo more moms and dads crying\nNo more arms in the air\nWe put firearms in the air\nMolotov cocktails thrown in the air\nCNN got dummy Don on the air\nTalking 'bout he smell that ganj in the air\nDummy don't know and dummy don't care\nGet that punk motherfucker outta here\nAye, ghosts are walking\nGhosts are talking\nEverything gon' be different, mane\nShh, karma's coming\nAin't no runnin'\nDeath gon' deal with the guilty, mane\nThe universe curses the killers, mane\nCan't keep killin' God's children, mane\nA pound of flesh is what you owe\nYour debt is due, give up your ghost\nThieves!\nThieves!\nThieves!\n\nWhat have you done?\nWhat have you done?\nWhat have you done?\nWhat are you making us do?\nThieves!\nIt's on you\nIt's on you\nThieves!\nIt's on you\nIt's on you\nIt's on you\nThieves!\n\nI think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard\nThieves!\n",
