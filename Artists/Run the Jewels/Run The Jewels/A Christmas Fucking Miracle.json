    "lyrics": "That was me in BK on Atlantic\nNever looked both ways, ran in traffic\nPops went away but I stayed, vagrant\nPlaced where the steel and cement became nature\nLove what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous\nCityscape where the blood of good men courses\nAnd the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain\nTake a knee to the gods and get horse shit\nWanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it\nGot a bevy of imps to spit hatred\nShit'll get in your head and cause panic\nHave you desperately begging to get famous\nGet your dignity dirty and left orphaned\nSanity on the fringe of distorted\nWho are they to just take shit and hoard it?\nWho am I that I don't get my portion?\nThe most impressionable minds get molested\nAnd informed by manipulating forces\nDon't fret little man, don't cry\nThey can never take the energy inside you were born with\nKnowing that, understand you could never be poor\nYou already won the war, you were born rich\nYou can only take the energy you had\nGoing back to the realm or the home where your lord is\nWhoever whatever that lord is couldn't\nGive a fuck if you ever made fortunes\nFuck anyone ever trying to run that bum shit\nSend 'em to the flames where the orcs live\nThem and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us\nDon't understand love's importance\nAnd we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth\nWhere the ashes and dust got formed in\n\nThe beat breaks and your teeth break\nKeep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake\nIt would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs\nFalling out your mouth and on to the landscape\nMe and El-P do the secret handshake\nThen I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face\n'Till he's punch drunk cause he's sweet as a pound cake\n(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say\nInto the wild, wildstyle ghetto child running wild\nWhere the lions and the owls stay\nThe powers that be even offered up reprieves\nTold us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees\nBut they can give that to the kings and\nQueens and the worshipers of idols and followers of things\nCause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages\nIt's kill or be killed and I'm working with the averages\nMy professor Emeritus say we been cursed being brought to the Americas\nHow you raise a whole human single parent, no marriages no sense of heritage\nPlanned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages\nBut I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative\nProduct of a teenage love,\nMy arrogance to rise from the pride\nAnd the job my parents did\nNamed Mike I was told it was godlike\nEven danced with the devil, came out alright\nOK, honor y'all? No way\nStill spell America with the triple K\nWord up to Spice 1 and O'Shea\nAnd any MC peepin' what I go through\nReal rap, my last line's so true\nRest in peace to Pimp C and Camu too\nWe do it for you\n",
