You fear the future\nI've seen the truth and I'm so deluded\nI been a better bad guy than I been better than bad\nBeen a better bully, talk beatin' on my chest\nIn fact I'm half stack from a rack\nI been around the block, babe, I know a few facts\nManiac, brainiac, run go tell them that\nATLien, NY felon rap\n\nHandle me wrong I'm snappin'\nShow up at your class, what's happenin'?\nSchoolyard bully with a fully automatic\nHeart full of pain and a head full of havoc\nEverybody stepped on the kid I'm letting them have it (have it)\nLeaving they momma to say \"what happened?\"\nWho gonna buy my baby a casket?\nFuck that bitch I'm a bastard\n\nMegablast, I'm mega lit\nOn Highway 6 and I'm not strapped in\nI don't crash, bitch, I just skid\nYou got the cash, I'll make the trip\nI make the trip, you better pay\nDone worse for less, don't make my day\nI'm not from Earth, from far away\nI bust through chests like baby greys\n\nRunnin' the jewels of the game\nWhippin' the mixes like chickens of 'caine\nSpittin' the sickness again\nParents is livid again\nKids is just fuckin' insane\nPointin' that pistol and fist for the chain\nReppin the symbol like they in a gang\nDelivery dope like a dosage of dope or a noseful of coke for a junkie or fiend\nOh my\nDon't cry\n",
