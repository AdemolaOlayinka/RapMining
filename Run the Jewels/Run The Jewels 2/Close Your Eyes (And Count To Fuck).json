Ain't nobody stylin', bruh\n'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh\nWhere my thuggers and my cripples and my bloodles and my brothers?\nWhen you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, mothafuckas?\nOr take over a jail, give those COs hell\nThe burnin' of the sulfur, God damn I love the smell\nLike it's a pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?\nAnd when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him\nWe killin' 'em for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom\nAnd even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em\n\nWe out of order, your honor, you're out of order\nThis whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses\nI'm a flip wig synonym, livin' within distortion\nI'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win\nI'm a New Yorkian, I fuck for the jump\nI wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch\nLook at Mikey, I think he likey, we are sinister sons\n(Aye, we the type to beat the preacher with a grin and a gun)\n\nRun them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast\nRun them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them\nRun them jewels fast, run them, run them jewels fast\nRun them, run them, r-run them, r-run them, run them, r-run them\n\nA wise man once said, (\"We all dead, fuck it\")\nJust spit it disgusting youngin', and hold your nuts while you're gunnin'\nI listened, tatted a sentence on my dick last summer\nNow I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder\nI'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey\nThe cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money\nI'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'\nWaitin' for their christenin', I know the neighbors can't help but listen in\nA dirty boy who come down on a side of dissonance\nI can't even relax without sirens off in the distances\nNot shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison\nThe only silence I have is an act of conjugal visitin'\n\nMy solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits\nGo mane and missin' my misses, they keepin' me from my children\nConditions create a villain, the villain is givin' vision\nThe vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious\nLiars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons\nThe forehead engravers, enslavers of men and women\nIncludin' members of clergy that rule on you through religion\n(So strippin' kids to the nude and then tell 'em God'll forgive 'em)\n\n\nIt's De La on the cut, liftin' 6 on your stitchy crew\nI'm miles ahead of you, you can sip my bitches brew\nMy battle status is burnin' mansions from Dallas to Malibu\nCheck my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, your residence is residue\nCall her a skin job and my honey dip'll backflip for you\nYou playin', God your eye sockets, she gon' rip in two\nWe sick of bleedin' out a trace, spray a victim, you\nDone dyin', Phillip AK Dickin' you\nWith clips in the bottom, we dippin' from Gotham\nYes eclipsed by the shadows, a dark dance to the coffin\nI'm a fellow with melanin, suspect of a felony\nRipped like Rakim Allah, feds is checkin' my melody\nYes aggressively tested we'll bump stretchers and penalties\nDump cases with face and the cop pleas when we seizing a pump\nWith reason to dump on you global grand dragons\nStill pilin' fast, plus Afghani toe taggin'\nNow they trackin' me and we bustin' back, see\nThe only thing that close quicker than our caskets be the factories\n",
