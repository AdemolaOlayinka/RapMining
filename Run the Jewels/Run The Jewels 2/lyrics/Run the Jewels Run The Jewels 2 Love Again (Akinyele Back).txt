Reminiscinin
On our time of innocence
When we drank that Hennessy
Ate on lamb and venison
Face fucked you in your kitchenette
Fucked you like we tusslin'
Do you fuck your husbaland
Like, do y'all be tusslin'?
Do you wear the muzzlin'
Do you ask him pretty please
Do you crawl on hands and knees
Like you used to do for me
Oh, you such a dirty girl
The world won't let you be yourself
I won't accept nothing else
I be having none of that
You be takin' all of this
Pleasure come from punishment
Your threshold astonishin'
I think I'm in love again
Found my perfect drug again
Feel better than heroin
You love my alpha arrogance
2 Live Crew the narrative
There it is

I put that dick in her mouth all day
She got that (dick in her mouth all day)
She take that (dick in her mouth all day)
(She said she wanted my, wanted my)
Dick in her mouth all day, day
I get with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She play with that (dick in her mouth all day)
She want that (dick in her mouth all day)
I think I'm in love again (Love again)

Here I am, my love
Just like when we first hooked up
Feeling like I'm animal
Feeling like you're edible
Bendable
I been away
I don't have too much to say
You say say it anyway
I say take your shirt off I'm not playing bae
You little freak
What you are is so unique
Smart and full of filth and joy
You been with some little boys
Now your with a grown-up man
One who'll actually understands
Kid gloves are not on my hands
I will never condescend
Now spread yourself
She smiled a bit
Gripped the outline of my shit
Oh, my god, I love this chick
I must put my tongue in this
Into every space I go
Give me everything you am
She said, "No, you gimme first"
That was like a day ago
8 AM
Still got my


That's what you want huh?
Well let me tell you a little story
I had a young player from the hood
Lick my pussy real good
Kept me stuck with lots of wood
Kept my bank account on swole
Sniffed my pussy like a rose, smokin' on dro
Made a porn tape
That nigga is a pro, you ain't know?
He had a lot of bad bitches in his past
But I was the one who turned that boy into a motherfuckin' man
His tongue is bomb
He say love for me to ride his face
Front to back, grippin' ass
Pay my bills, where I live, fuck me good
Broke-ass niggas killing me
I'm about my money, ho
Never been a square bitch
He ain't paying? Hit the fuckin' do'
Talking slick, that Memphis shit
I be from that Haven click
Keep it ratchet so sweet
All these boys kiss my feet
I be on that queen shit
You better bless my realness
Stick your tongue up in my ass
You better show me who you fuckin' with
Run The Jewels
Love again, you gon' lose, I'm gon' win
Let's have an orgy
I'mma share your ass with all my friends (Yeah, ho!)

He want this clit in his mouth all day
He want this clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I've got this I've got this fool in love again (Yeah ho!)
I put my clit in his mouth all day
I put my clit in his mouth all day (Yeah, ho!)
He want this clit in his mouth all day
I've got this fool in love again (Love again)
