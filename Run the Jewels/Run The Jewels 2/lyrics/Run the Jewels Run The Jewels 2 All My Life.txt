(Paul is dead)
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for...One time for...
One time for the pill and the reefer, man
One time for the...One, one-one-one

One time for the pill and the reefer, man
It's the young black leader to the people, man
If you’re girl’s fine, nigga might eat her, man
I'm talkin' middle of the mall like a pita, man
A Nigga sky high now like Jesus, man
And oh Lord this reefer so potent
Got an anti gravity, a Nigga stay floatin'
This nigga rob me, bitch you must be jokin'
Like pow pow pow leave your chestplate open
One half the best tag team ever
Them other fellas all right we better
Anybody disagree they jealous
And anybody don’t just motherfucking yellow (just yellow)
Fuck a boss I’m the goddamn owner
And I smell like YSL and marijuana
Don Draper with the paper might pull a slick caper
Secretary told me fuck you. I told her you gonna

And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch
(All my life)
And I been this way, shorty
(All my life)
And I been this way, bitch

Sharp like knife
I bet a buck I’m stuck in the guts of the night
And I’m (ready on the right)
Please pass that already, alright
Get fetti, he’s steady on the mic what the fuck else can he do right?
Step armed heavy and he brought Mike
Never step light, no fair fights
We got the drugs y'all wanted
Take a suck on the tail of a comet
I’m so high you a hobbit
Dick level, please back up off it
Better off dead like Paul is
Your name don't Ring, go Starrless
Me and Mike we a friend to the farmers
The weed run out, we might cop your whole harvest

Go!
