    "lyrics": "Now come over here and let me give you a tongue kiss on your hot pocket...\n\nMe and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes\nPut your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced\nCaught the ghost when I was yay high so today I stay way high\nDo not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life\n\nThis is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe\nA hit of this, a kid with Tourette's will chill out and act right\nI'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike\nThey suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes\n\nI slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes\nHumblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (get it?)\nI'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two\nThey say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick'll do\n\nI'm so Rakim and Eric B bitches check out my melody\nI might Slick Rick on a fella (foul), catch me a felony\nHey, I might Shyne Po a ho, POW! Catch me a case\nProducto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced\n\nI must say you do look stunning\nI mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating\nOh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?\nCan we start from the beginning? My name is Chest Rockwell, right?\nAnd I love to make love to your booty...hole\nBad boy\n\nThis is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly\nLife's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity\nThis is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing\nI am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent\n\nThis is arrogant fat black, it is what it is\nThis that stingy with dick, bitch, not a fuck do I give\nI'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules\nI catch the prince of England slipping, he goin' run me the jewels\nI could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be\nThe illest there'll ever be cause I be what you'll never be\nMy pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree\nAnd dogs fight to the death, you say you better, you better be\n\nNot one shit given, El-P's chillin'\nRaised in a shack in the back of the village\nTrained by the wolves in the woods\nTo avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers\nMike's a villain, Nick Hooks chillin'\nWe don't have a need to know your feelings\nWe don't believe in the same shit anyway, Run the Jewels is not for your children\n\nHow you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?\nMaybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew\nYeah, works like a charm. Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control\nI got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards...\nOh yeah baby, the night's just getting started\nOk, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway.\nWe can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter\nYou can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck\nI love you\n",
