    "lyrics": "You know I get loose, I'm a screw turned pro status\nNever did shit but inflict this damage\nNever met a word that I wouldn't like a weapon just brandish\nWalk away clown boy, vanish\nFeelin' outlandish, chemicals soaked in my cabbage\nFace numb, face off rap shit, straight no chasing that dragon\nCess to the breast plate, raised where the stakes break badness\nGet a tracheotomy tap for talkback shit\nSlow clap, do the running man, back flip\nLight a flare in the road, I'm an accident\nLimping into the light I'm off axis\nWe got 808s to make cats piss, right on the rug where the cat sits\nBy the time this recording gets heard I'll be gone\nWith the dough from the jar plus mattress\nLeft a note on the fridge with a frowny face drawn\nWith a rope from its neck to the rafters\nNot the most subtle way to explain\nI'm a threat to the brain like a wool in the glass hit\n\nI get so high, I close my eyes\nLike I may die, and I won't come down\n\nYou know I get gone I'm a goner\nIn the VIP of the club where they strip with a zip and a boner\nGirl named Mary looking like a black Madonna\nTell me I can rent her but I can never own her\nShe's naked as the day that her momma first born her\nAnd later on in the song, yeah, I'mma bone her\nBut that ain't the purp, bro, please follow along, bro\nGod made a miracle it rained in the room\nBlowing marijuana smoke in a smoke filled room\nShe leaned in my ear said \"You ever did shrooms?\"\nI said \"I never did that and I never did you\nIf it come in a pack baby I'mma do two.\"\nLast act of the pact Mary Mack do it too\n\"If you agree to the terms we can do what it do\"\nShe said \"It is what it is.\" and we did what we did\nRight before we popped 3 caps and 3 stems\nShe popped that molly, rocked my body, I fly high and my co-pilot\nPsilocybin, got me slidin, slipping into another dimension\nMe and this woman made love in Kemet\nTraveled to the moon came back when we were finished\nFell to the earth, lost each other, died and we came back sister and brother\nIn that lifetime we couldn't have each other\nSo we killed ourselves and it killed our mother\nTrue romance, in one lap dance\nI was in my future, my present and past\n",
