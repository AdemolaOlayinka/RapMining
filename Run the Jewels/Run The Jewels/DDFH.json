    "lyrics": "Cops in the ghetto they move like the Gestapo\nDrunk off their power and greed, they often hostile\nMy little homie talked shit back and they beat him bad\nThat boy in the hospital now he's lookin' bad\nAnd I'm with his mom and dad, we lookin' sad\nMy own mama called me, said \"Baby, I'm just glad\nThey ain't put they hands on my child and kill his ass\nPlease don't rap about that shit 'fore they murder your black ass\"\nIt's drones over Brooklyn, you blink you could get took-en\nAnd now you're understanding the definition of \"Crooklyn\"\nPigs on parade but bacon fryin' and cookin'\nCause kids tired of dying and walkin' round like they shook-en\nCause we smoke sour to deal with the paranoia\nThat they charge by the hour, can't hire the Jewish lawyer\nCause if you ain't Jigga or Puff, you doing time\nAnd even then, you might get ten, word to Shyne\n\n(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)\nDo dope, fuck hope\n(Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey hey-hey)\nDo dope, fuck hope\n\nYou don't wanna look into my big crystal balls, suck the future\nWe'll moonwalk through flames with a brain on stupid\nCamouflage toughies'll touch your tufts roughly\nFluff your flat permanent, lump you up ruthless\nThen laugh while you're humming the tune of bruised movements\nThat took a few too many tabs to prove lucid\n(Everything compute?) Nah the truth is too tangled\nAnd even a satellite sees at one angle\nBurners radiate smoke 'til all's motionless\nHope? Nah, ha ha, slow down with the jokin' shit\nSo inappropriate, right behind your ears is a what?\nLook: ta-dah! The sound of your hopelessness\nI can feel it too, from the ground rising up in us\nRight above the clouds there's a shroud there to smother us\nMake a sane man walk around with a blunderbuss\nPeel another round, make a sound that is thunderous\n",
