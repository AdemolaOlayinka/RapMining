    "lyrics": "Really fell out the lane with this shit\nMan, print this shit: I'm a misfit\nGot a style from the guts of the most irrational beast in the district\nBorn to the next gen system\nSlow water drip to the temple to live in a prison\nWhen the walls don't appear to your vision\nOne floor down from that mall's that prison\nWhere shower stalls'll get all y'all missin'\nPardon me, I got half-wit vision\nBut fuck I know, I just crawled here, cap'n\nPass me the baton, the rest a ya'll batten the hatches\nIn fact, better scram, I'm a bastard\nOn the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit, trying not to slam into traffic\nWith my feet on the wheel and my hands through the moon roof laughing\nLet's crash this\nSee the truth from the womb is a fool-proof plan to be doomed while the damned do they dances\nSo I move through the room like an animal fooling a master\nBut I don't got love for the hand with the food, matter fact I am drooling at that shit\nI don't only bite but I'm rabid\nTry to pet my fucking head again and I'mma put a tooth through the flesh of the palm that you jack with\nThis city just screams black magic, and the threat to my heart got traction\nMaybe should've never started this path\nEvery time I get a chance to advance it's backwards\nNo thanks to my very own actions\nGet a couple good drinks in the kid\nI can flip on a friend, take a drug, fuck a chick that I shouldn't\nOh god, I am one of those mad men\n\nTrying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped\nBut I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say where this land begins and that water stops\nI got sea legs\n\nReal shit, I came for the jewels\nI'm the killer of kings and fools\nI'm the reason the season for treason starts this evening\nAnd this evening the odds ain't even\nPeople praying to the gods but the gods ain't even listening\nDon't matter if you're Muslim, Hebrew, Christian\nWhen death runs in the distance there will be no Mercy me's\nThere will be no reprieve for the thieves\nThere will be no respect for The Thrones\nNo master mastered these bones\nYour idols all are my rivals\nI rival all of your idols\nI stand on towers like Eiffel, I rifle down all your idols\nNiggas will perish in Paris, niggas is nothing but parrots\nI write for the writers that write for the liars that impress you and your parents\nIs this real or another dimension?\nAm I trippin' here in the kitchen?\nAm I a victim of my convictions?\nI feel my sanity slippin'\nAnd I think I like the freedom\nCannibal, animal, rappers I eat'em\nEven in Dubai I smoke like it's legal\nBitch so exotic she rode on a zebra\nMade in America home of the (eagle)\nHome of the (anger), home of the (evil)\nDo what I do for the good of my people\nHolding my lane, smoke jane in a Regal\n",
