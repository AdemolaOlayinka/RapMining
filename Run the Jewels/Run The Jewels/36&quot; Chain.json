Not far\nThe greatness they claim, not all\nAre not, we are those juggernauts\nMe El, we hail\nLike a young Che Guevara and Fidel\nCastro, cash flow, car full of females\nBad hoes, we in the DR\nAny fuck rapper boy gettin' out of line I pray the preacher beat him to the goddamn ER\nI spit them country rap tunes like Hee-Haw\nCocaine flow fishscale no re-rock\nTake a snort for yourself shawty, see? \"he raw...\n(sniff) See he raw!\"\nThat\u2019s you shawty go on snort your nose off\nThen put the news in the street Tom Brokaw\nCause of you shawty met a bad stone bitch out of Brooklyn and that Brooklyn bitch straight got broke off\nYeah she called her homegirl from the BX, freaky lil 'Rican brought X and we sexed\nCouple months later brought 'em down to Atlanta and let 'em style on the 'bamas that's right yeah we flex\nHeard she got a baby daddy and a nigga acting aggy runnin' round talkin' 'bout yeah he plexed\nNigga better pray for a ho like he Tebow though cause right now he stay losin\u2019 like The Jets\n\nAnd I walk around like I got a 36\" chain\nAnd I walk around like I got a 36\" chain\n\nBitch we be that shit that's right\nLight a flare put your thumbs in the air high five\nI came for the stash box gimme that\nI been waitin' for this all my life\n3 AM and I'm still not right\nStill awake still away from fading\nCrazy\nPsilocybin\nWhy the ride so hazy\nDribble this spit till the street gets wavy\nThe bliss and pure shit magician\nGet to skipping\nNot too tall dark and handsome man\nBut I talk dark for ransoms man\nSpend grands of those zombies\nFolded origami\nYes I bag the clams\nAnyone object to the styles, get a smile and a backwards hand\nPeep that felonious face in the place of an angel\nBringing that buckshot back to the table\nBeen a veteran, earthbound hellion\nTry to say grace get a face full of staples\nWoke up and the city air smelled like maple\nIf you come straight from New York you relate\nIf you come straight from another place stay too\nMe and Mike got the whole map held safe\n\nBe it NYC or the ATL\nFrom the ceilings of heaven to the gates of hell\nWe murder death killed every stage we step\nHomicide times two better warn yourself, El\n\nAnybody looking for some trouble better self med\nWe could double dutch in a minefield, hell gets\nJust the right temperature, break beat minister\nRiverdance cleats on your face for the finisher\n",
