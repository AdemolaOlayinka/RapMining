This is not a fight that you have been dealing with flesh and blood but this is a fight against principalities and evil doers and unclean spirits. (RTJ3 motherfuckers)\n\nBrave men didn't die face down in the Vietnam mud so I could not style on you\nI didn't walk uphill both ways to the booth and back to not wile on you\nYou think baby Jesus killed Hitler just so I'd whisper?\nWhen you're safe and sound and these crooks tap your phone and now have a file on you?\nWhat me worry? Nah buddy, I've lost before, so what?\nYou don't get it, I'm dirt, motherfucker, I can't be crushed\nFuckers open the books up and stop bullshitting the kid\nMy dick got a mission to storm on par with the best ever took the gig\nI'ma super cat, from don dada to dusk, don't bother to touch\nI got firm clutch on the grip and the pumps\nI might ghost ride a tank, take a ride to the bank\nGot the son of Rick Rubin rushing full thrust\nDon't flash weak shit to the Shark Tank judge\nTalk real good cause I'm smart and stuff\nWe a good crew to fuck with, better to love\n\nI told y'all suckers, I told y'all suckers. I told y'all on RTJ1, then I told ya again on RTJ2, and you still ain't believe me. So here we go, RTJ3\n\nTalk to me\nRTJ, Talk to me\n",
