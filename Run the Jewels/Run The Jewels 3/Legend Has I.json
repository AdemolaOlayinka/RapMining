We dash away\nDonner and Dixon, the pistol is blastin' away\n\nDoctors of death\nCuring our patients of breath\nWe oughta pay you the trust\nCookin' up work\nCookin' up curses and slurs\nSmokin' my brain into mush\nI became famous for blamin' you fucks\nMaimin' my way through the brush\nThere is no training or taming of me and my bruh\nLook like a man, but I'm animal raw\n\nWe are the murderous pair\nThat went to jail and we murdered the murderers there\nThen went to Hell and discovered the devil\nDelivered some hurt and despair\nUsed to have powder to push\nNow I smoke pounds of the kush\nHoly, I'm burnin' a bush\nNow I give a fuck about none of this shit\nJewel runner over and out of this bitch\nWoo!\nWoo!\nStep into the spot like woo!\nWoo!\n\nCopping of uppers and downers get done\nI'm in a rush to be numb\nDroppin' a thousand ain't much\nCome from the clouds\nOn a missile to turn this whole town into dust\nDon't make a sound, baby, hush\nI am the living swipe right on the mic, I'm a slut\nI don't know how to not spit like a lout\nI'll spill a pound of my kids on your couch\n\nHalf of a mongol and mythical team\nFeelin' this treacherous theme\nLegend says El is a spawn out of Hell\nThe myth is my mom is a murderous queen\nYour life can end like in Godfather 1\nYou get the gun as I christen my son\nIf I die today and it's Hell I should pay\nTell the Lord Mikey said, \"Fuck it was fun\"\n\nEvery new record's my dick in a box\nWe here the goons, eat them rulers alot\nYou're getting used to me doing no wrong\nI don't play chicken, you prick, I'm a fox\nYou wanna kick it, I'll give you the rock\nYou kiss the wood chipper blade if you bark\nI'm fuckin' magic, in fact I'm a warlock can talk\nI got a unicorn horn for a (stop)\nWoo!\nWoo!\nStep into the spot like woo!\nWoo!\nAnd the crowd goes RTJ!\nAnd the crowd goes RTJ!\nAnd the crowd goes RTJ!\nAnd the crowd goes RTJ!\nRTJ!\nRTJ!\nRTJ!\nRTJ!\n\nMike in the jelly, won't snitch\nI'll rent a room at the Ritz\nI'll sip a fifth of the whisk\nI'll smoke a dub in the tub\nThen I will split both my wrists\n\nI'll pull a sword on you simps\nJust for the flick of the wrist\nKitchen not givin' a miss\nMe and Mike skip away whistlin' and grin\nEverything's golden when you only win\n\nBullyin' bastards and beatin' on beats\nSounds like a day at the beach, preach\nI keep the metals to step on your feet\nBefore you can speak, blaow to defeat\n\nWe move on one to ones, you think I'm meek\nYou think I'm lyin', you right, see my teeth\nDon't be a bore when I roar if I move\nHunting's no fun when your prey doesn't move\nI'll put a gun to a bunny like choose\nSay somethin' funny or bunny go boom\nYou got a bevy of shit you could groove\nWe'd like to thank you for choosing our crew\n\nAnd that's from the crew you can trust\nWarranty plus for fuckin' shit up\nWe are the no-gooders, do-gooders\nKnown to the dancers and dealers and doers of dust\n",
