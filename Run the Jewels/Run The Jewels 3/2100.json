    "lyrics": "How long before the hate that we hold\nLead us to another Holocaust?\nAre we so deep in it that we can't end it?\nStop, hold, ever call it off\nIt's too clear, nuclear's too near\nAnd the holders of the molotov\nSay that \"revolution's right here, right now\"\nAnd they ain't callin' off\n\nWake up, roll an eighth up\nThrow a double finger with a fist\nHere at the abyss\nI will be your tour guide\nIt is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)\nOver to your right, shine a light\nGot a bevy ready for the fight\nI just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip\nOnly hunt bliss\nI am still a kid in my heart\nBut these motherfuckers sick\nThey don't give a shit, not at all\nThey don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot\nListen along\nThey don't want your love, shit is bugged\nMotherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood\nLove when you beg\nTrust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun\nLove will survive\nRun out under iridescent lights for our lives\nI will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight\nWild for the night\nLook into my eyes\nI am standing at your side for the fight\nMinds over might\nSwear to God\nThey could barely even see the dog\nThey don't see the size of the fight\n\nWake up\nDrink water\nSmoke blunt\nClean off my Kalashnikov\nStop, pow\nTen for a min\nFree this case shit, get the poppin' off\nThe evening news givin' yous views\nTelling you to pick your master for president\nThen behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'\nCame back with some evidence\nI'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong\nMake love, smoke kush, fight, or laugh hard, and live long\nThat's the anecdote\nYou defeat the devil when you hold onto hope\n'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful\nAnd we ain't gotta die for them other men\nAnd I refuse to kill another human being\nIn the name of a government\n'Cause I don't study war no more\nI don't hate the poor no more\nGettin' more ain't what's more\nOnly thing more is the love\nSo when you see me\nPlease greet me with a heart full\nAnd a pound and a hug\n\nSave my swollen heart\nBring me home from the dark\nTake me home, take me home, take me home\nTake me home, take me home, take me home\nUp, up, up\nUp, up\nUp, up, up, up, up, up\n\nSeen the devil give a sermon in the church\nSeen an angel dancing in the club\nTryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air\nAnd blessed her with a hug\nI done been down so many times\nWalked on like a dirty rug\nAnd now that I made it, can't fake it\nGotta give me what I'm truly worthy of\n(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)\n\nAnd I don't how much it really means to be right\n(Means to be right, means to be right)\nAnd what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life\n(Peace in this life, peace in this life)\nAnd it occurs to me that maybe we ain't ever really seen any right\nHere in the dark\nHoping just to see a beam of the light\n(Beam of the light, beam of the light)\n\nSave my swollen heart\nBring me home from the dark\nTake me home, take me home, take me home\nTake me home, take me home, take me home\n",
