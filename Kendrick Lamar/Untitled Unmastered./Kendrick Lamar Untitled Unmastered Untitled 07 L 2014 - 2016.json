the odds\nWhat an accomplishment, broken promises\nKept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence\nThe greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is\nYou niggas fear me like y\u2019all fear God\nYou sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice\nJust know the mechanics of making your choice and writin\u2019 your bars\nBefore you poke out your chest, loosen your bra\nBefore you step out of line and dance with the star\nI could never end a career if it never start\nThe murderous capital, avenues lookin\u2019 like evil dead zombies\nWith batteries to the head\nThe flattery of watchin\u2019 my stock rise\nThe salary, the compensation tripled my cock size\nI run through these stop signs with no brake fluid\nJust premium gas, do it for dolo\nCrash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo\nBlack excellence, pessimist died countin\u2019 my coin\nHope it\u2019s evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better\nI blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather\nForecasted my future, this is the future\nThe mastermind until my next album, more power to you\nGunshots\n\nCome on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on\nThis is a fifteen minute song\nWe\u2019re just jammin\u2019 out, we on stage\nTaz, we just jammin\u2019 out\nHundred thousand\nHundred thousand, you gotta see it!\nLook, look, look, go back to the down note\nThey all sing this shit, everybody\nNow I don\u2019t let you down, and for\nYou see, you see, you see, you see\nBut I don\u2019t shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you\nThey say the government ain\u2019t the truth, truth, truth, truth\nAnd the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth\nBut head is the answer\nHead is the future\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself\nCome on, give me some help\nHey one more time, band, I need y\u2019all to help me out right now\nHead is the answer\nHead is the future, it\u2019s the future, that nigga said\nDon\u2019t second guess yourself\nCome on, give me some help\nSay come on, come on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, my background singer\nCome on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on, come on, come on, come on, come on\nI said, girl you make me wanna uh\nThe ho screaming now\nI said baby you make..\nYou make me wanna just AHHH!\nBaby you got me speechless right now\nLaughs\nI gotta take it there, I ain\u2019t even playin\u2019 no more\nSaid you just make me wanna Drake you down\nTo the ground, to the ground ground\nLike bam, bam, bam, bam, bam\nYou just make me wanna Drake you down\nDown, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam\nAnd baby if your mama\u2019s around, if your mama\u2019s around\nIf your mama\u2019s around, if your mama\u2019s around\nTell her, tell her\nNo discrimination, she\u2019s young nigga chasin\u2019\nAnd she can get this dick too!\nI said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on\nYeah, nigga\nYou gotta do it, man\nWe gonna lay that shit\nWe gonna lay that shit, and watch what it\u2019s gon\u2019 do\n",
