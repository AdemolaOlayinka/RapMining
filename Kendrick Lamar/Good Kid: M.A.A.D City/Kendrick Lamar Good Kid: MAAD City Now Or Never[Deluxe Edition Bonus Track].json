    "lyrics": "We on?\nAight\n1, 2, 3, go!\n\nWaking up in a dream\nSleepwalking on another big stage\nYou never heard peace 'til you hear people scream\nYour name and your song, I'm so far away\nFrom the place I used to be, struggling usually\nLook at the newer me, fate pursuing me\nI can feel the energy in the air\nIt feel like I'm supposed to be here\n\nEverywhere I go I'm getting so much love\nFans, the stars, everyone\nSayin how they can't wait for the LP\nAnd I'm gonna blow\nThey believe in me\nFeel so good in what you do\nHelps somebody else get through\nThat's why I do the best I can\nBecause I know how blessed I am\n\nI'm so high I can touch the sky\nI know it's my time\nAnd it's now or never\nShine so bright, I light the night\nAnd it feels so right, ain't nothing better\n\nA fool if I take it all for granted\nA smart man if I keep my feet planted\nTo the earth cause the people that hurt can understand it\nYou speakin' outlandish\nI'm a show you how to make it all work\nAnother plan, it a short term goal for me\nA record sold for me\nIt's just more of me in your ear\nFor you to hear Kendrick persevere\nDefenses I feel relentless\nAmbition with a clear vision\nTakin' off I ain't takin off these Pistons\nI'm takin' off on the inner me - you're distance\nCame across me, how much it'a cost me\nTo get you out my business\nI set a plan, it's a short term goal, no sky is the limit\nI'm past that, now pass that\nAward, not one but four\nTimes two plus yours\n\nI see myself performing there, (K.dot)\nSold out shows where the room is packed\nSitting at the Grammy's winning five awards\nSee myself on big billboards\nTraveling around the world with endorsement deals\nCan't imagine how it feels\nThat's why I'm smiling everyday\nBecause my dream ain't far away\n\nI'm so high I can touch the sky\nI know it's my time\nAnd it's now or never\nShine so bright, I light the night\nAnd it feels so right, ain't nothing better\n\nYou looking at me and you tell me I'm blessed\nCalculated my steps, my heart, my breath\nBreathe hums? of a victory and vividly\nYou see me when at my best, my worst\nThis verse dedicated to the days that I slept\nWith a curse research my paid dues I'm reimbursed\nI burst in the crowd with a voice and crown\nI'm a King on the prowl and I see mama smile?\nAnd I vow on the tape that I'll never break\nYou can break bread with me now\nWe can all take a bow on the edge of the pedestal\nThen scream out loud that we made it off the avenue\nAnd walked that mile\nIn the darkness I often sit back\nAnd get lost in the rap that I wrote\nWhen you told me that it spoke to your soul\nI was talking to you\nI was walking it through every ghetto\nTell success hello\nWe here\n\nAnd I'm so happy I cry\nCause I can't believe\nAll the things I ever wanted\nAre finally happening for me\nAnd it's so surreal\nThat I almost feel\nThat any minute I can wake up\nFrom this fantasy\nWhen you pray so hard\nAnd you've come so far\nAnd you know that it's the time for you lift your bar\nAnd I'm gonna do it\nWatch me!\n\nI'm so high I can touch the sky\nI know it's my time\nAnd it's now or never\nShine so bright, I light the night\nAnd it feels so right, ain't nothing better\n",
