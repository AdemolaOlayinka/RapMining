Do you, bang\nTwo chopper, two hundred shots, bang\nI ride, you ride, bang\nOne chopper, one hundred shots, bang\nHop out. Do you, bang\nTwo chopper, two hundred shots, bang\n\nNigga why you babysittin' only 2 or 3 shots?\nI'm a show you how to turn it up a notch\nFirst you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nPool full of liquor, then you dive in it\nI wave a few bottles, then I watch em all flock\nAll the girls wanna play Baywatch\nI got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it\nPool full of liquor I'm a dive in it\n\nPour up (drank), head shot (drank)\nSit down (drank), stand up (drank)\nPass out (drank), wake up (drank)\nFaded (drank), faded (drank)\n",
