(Soul!) Spread your wings, you probably won't get far\nI honestly wouldn't advise operating a car\nTry not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya\nAnd end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us\n\n\n\nSo it's that groovy little nigga known for popping them bottles\nUnder my pants be a golden dick, bitch, everything about me solid\nBurberry nigga, them be my draws, Alexander McQueen in closets\nSwagged-out king, yeah nigga I'm Puff, uh, have that pussy throbbin'\nSomeone tell me where the drugs at, I'm into that, twisted off them molly caps\nCiroc too don't fuck wit Goose; can I get a shot, swim in your juice?\nWorth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat\nI ain't tryna sweep you off your feet - bitch, did you see your tab reciept?\n\n\n\u201cSherane?\u201d\n(Pool full of liqour then you dive in, in, in, in )\n\u201cSherane, Sherane, Sherane\u201d (Wa-Watch em all f-flock)\n\"Awww man\"\n\u201cSherane\u201d (Girls wanna play, play, play)\nWhere is she taking me? (P-Pool full of liquor imma d-d-i-iive in)\nWhere is she, taking\u2026 me\n\nAll I, all I, all I, all I have in life is my new appetite for failure\nAnd I got hunger pain that grow insane; tell me do that sound familiar?\nIf it do then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief\nIs in the bottom of the bottle, and the greenest indo leaf\nAs the window open I release, everything that corrode inside of me\nI see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I probably sleep\nAnd never ever wake up; never ever wake up, never ever wake up\nIn God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough\n\nMore, more, bless me more\nWe gon drink this mothafucka down, more\nBottoms up then we pass it round, more\nFill it up more, not enough, moooore\n...Bless me more\nWe gon drink this mothafucka down, more\nBottoms up then we pass it round, more\nFill it up more, not enough, more\n",
