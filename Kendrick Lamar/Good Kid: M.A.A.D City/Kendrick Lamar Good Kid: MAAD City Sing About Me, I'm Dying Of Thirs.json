    "lyrics": "2012)\nWhen the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hoping that I can borrow a piece of mind\nI'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright\nAnd a fight he tried to put up, but the type\nOf bullet that stuck had went against his will\nAs blood spilled on your hands\nMy plans rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back whispering, \"Get em\"\nI got em, and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover\nA passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a young'n\nIn pajamas and Dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs\nDumb niggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child\nI'm proud and well devoted\nThis piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'm a push it, wherever whenever\nAnd I love you cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop I hope -\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it section.80, the message resemble Brenda's Got a Baby\nWhat's crazy was, I was hearin about it\nBut doubted your ignorance, how could you ever\nJust put her on blast and shit\nJudging her past and shit\nWell it's completely my future\nA nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit\nAnd I'm a need that 40 dollars even if I gotta\nFuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot\nGonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tingling keys\nMatter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get em back\nTo where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman, or better yet a leader\nYou need her to learn something, then you probably need to beat her\nThat's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted\nBut fuck that \"Sorry for your loss shit\"\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\nYour rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\nCause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away\nI know my fate, and I'm on the grind for this cake\nI'm a get or die trying, I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying\nYou lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit...\n\nWhen the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\nSometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself\nAm I really scared of passing away\nIf it's today I hope I hear a\nCry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the holy ghost till it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline\nRake in the cent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon\nAnd if I'm doomed, may the wound\nHelp me mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day the glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm sure not why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about\nCause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe cause I'm dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the scheme of, wondering when I'm a rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that put me\nIn a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"it need to be told\nCursing the life of 20 generations after her soul\"\nExactly would have happened if I hadn't continued rappin\nOr steady being distracted by money drugs and four\nFives, I count lives all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFighting for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nNow am I worth it?\nDid I put enough work in?\n\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off\nAnd it's my turn to settle down\nMy main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n\nTired of running\nTired of hunting\nMy own kind\nBut retiring nothing\nTires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing\nHands on the wheel, who said we wasn't?\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nDope on the corner\nLook at the coroner\nDaughter is dead\nMother is mourning her\nStrayed bullets, AK bullets\nResuscitation was waiting patiently\nBut they couldn't, bring her back\nWho got the footage? channel 9\nCameras looking, it's hard to channel your energy\nWhen you know you're crooked\nBanana clip split his banana pudding\nI'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding\nI know I'm good at\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nHow many sins?\nI'm running out\nHow many sins?\nI lost count\nDreams of ballin like Spalding\nBut only shotty bounce\nThe reaper calling\nI'm cottonmouth\nMoney is power, yours is ours\nLay with a snitch, die with a coward\nHope we get rich, hope we can tower\nOver the city with vanity with the music louder\nThe same song\nA black flower\nI'll show you how to\nDye your thirst\nDye your thirst\nDye your thirst\nWhat are we doing?\nWho are we fooling?\nHell is hot, fire is proven\nTo burn for eternity, return of the student\nThat never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it\nTired of running, choirs is humming\nTell us to visit, we lying about coming\nNow back to business, loading the guns in\nBack of the Buick, your hood is feuding\nAnd the beef is bubbling\nIt's no discussion, hereditary\nAll of my cousins\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nDying of thirst\nToo many sins\nI'm running out\nSomebody send\nMe a well for the drought\nSee, all I know, is taking notes\nOn taking this life for granted\nGranted, if he provoke\nMy best days, I stress days (Lord forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)\nMy best days, I stress days\nSay \"Fuck the world, \" my sex slave\nMoney, pussy and greed what's my next crave\nWhatever it is, know it's my next grave\nTired of running, tired of running\nI'm tired of tumbling, tired of running\nI'm tired of tumbling\nBackwards my mama say\n\"See a pastor, give me a promise\nWhat if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished\nThe truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest\nYou dying of thirst\nYou dying of thirst\nSo hop in that water, and pray that it works\"\n",
