No Way\nHit the brakes, when they on patrol? No Way\n\nImagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets\nSanta Claus don't miss them stockings, liquor spilling pistols popping\nBaking soda YOLA whipping, ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving\nMy homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him\nPots with cocaine residue, everyday I'm hustling\nWhat else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government\nGotta provide for my daughter n'em, get the fuck up out my way, bitch\nGot that drum and got them bands just like a parade, bitch\nDrop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash\nIf they do tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass\nFrom the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurking blood\nBitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs but it's all good\nBroken promises, steal yo watch and tell you what time it is\nTake your J's and tell you to kick it where a footlocker is\nIn the streets with a heater under my dungarees\nDreams of me getting shaded under a money tree\n",
