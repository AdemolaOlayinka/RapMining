    "lyrics": "Mass hallucination baby\nIll education baby\nWant to reconnect with your relations\nThis is your station baby\n\nLook inside these walls and you see them having withdrawals\nOf a prisoner on his way\nTrapped inside your desire\nTo fire bullets that stray\nTrack a tire just tell you I'm tired and ran away\nI should ask a choir what do you require\nTo sing a song that acquire me to have faith\nAs the record spin I should pray\nFor the record I recognize that I'm easily prey\nI got ate alive yesterday\nI got animosity building\nIt's probably big as a building\nMe jumping off of the roof\nIs just me playing it safe\nBut what am I supposed to do\nWhen the topic is red or blue\nAnd you understand that I ain't\nBut know I'm accustomed to\nJust a couple that look for trouble\nAnd live in the street with rank\nNo better picture to paint than me walking from bible study\nAnd called his homies because he had said he noticed my face\nFrom a function that tooken place\nThey was wondering if I bang\nStep on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks\nI don't mind because one day you respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d. city\n\n\nAll I see is strobe lights\nBlinding me in my hindsight\nFinding me by myself\nPromise me you can help\nIn all honesty I got time to be copacetic\nAnd finally made decision to hold me against my will\nIt was like a head on collision that folded me standing still\nI can never pick out the difference\n? or cop on the bill\nEvery time you clock in the morning\nI feel you just want to kill\nAll my innocence while ignoring my purpose\nTo persevere as a better person\nI know you heard this and probably in fear\nBut what am I supposed to do\nWith the blinking of red and blue\nFlash from the top of your roof\nAnd your dog has to say proof\nAnd you ask \"lift up your shirt\"\nCause you wonder if a tattoo\nOf affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through\nGang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile\nI heard them chatter: \"He's probably young but I know that he's down\"\nStep on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest\nHe don't mind, he know we never respect\nThe good kid, m.A.A.d. city\n\n\nAll I see in this room\n20 Xanies and these 'shrooms\nGrown-up candy for pain\nCan we live in the same society\nIt's entirely stressful upon my brain\nYou hired me as a victim\nI quietly hope for change\nWhen violence is the rhythm\nInspired me to obtain\nThe silence in this room\nWith 20 Xanies and 'shrooms\nSome grown-up candy I lost it\nI feel it's nothing to lose\nThe streets sure to release the worst side of my best\nDon't mind, cause now you ever in debt\nTo good kid, m.A.A.d. city\n",
