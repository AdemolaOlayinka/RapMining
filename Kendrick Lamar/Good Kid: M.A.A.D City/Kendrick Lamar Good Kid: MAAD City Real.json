    "lyrics": "2012)\nI do what I wanna do\nI say what I wanna say\nWhen I feel, and I...\nLook in the mirror and know I'm there\nWith my hands in the air\nI'm proud to say yea\nI'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real\n\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie even if they tell\nSweet lullabies that come with a smell\nOf a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill\nYou living in a world that come with plan B\nCause plan A never relay a guarantee\nAnd plan C never could say just what it was\nAnd your plans only can pan around love\nYou love him, you love them, you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\nYou love red-bottom and gold they say queen\nYou love hand-bag on the waist of your jean\nYou love french tip and trip that pay for\nYou love bank slip that tell you we paid more\nYou love a good hand whenever the card dealt\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself\n\n\nI promise that I know you very well\nYour eyes never lie even if they fell\nOut the sky and your optics? turn stale\nWhere they mow that's green\nI can see you fit the bill\nOf living in a world that come with Plan B\nCause Plan A only can make another mistake\nAnd you can't see success coming from plan C\nWhen it all breaks you, you still say you love me\nAnd love them and love when you love her\nYou love so much, you love when love hurts\nYou love fast cars and their present is old\nYou love fast women\nYou love keepin' control\nOf everything you love, you love beef\nYou love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police\nYou love your hood, might even love it to death\nBut what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?\n\n\nThe reason why I know you very well\nCause we have the same eyes can't you tell\nThe days I tried to cover up and conceal\nMy pride, it only made it harder for me to deal\nWhen living in a world that come with plan B\nA scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free\nAnd plan C just an excuse like because\nOr the word \"but\", but what if I got love\nI love them, I love when I love her\nI love so much, I love when love hurts\nI love first verse cause you're the girl I attract\nI love second verse cause your the homie they packed\nBurning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch\nI love what the both of you have to offer\nIn fact, I love it so much\nI don't love anything else\nBut what love got to do with it when I don't love myself\nTo the point I should hate everything I do love\nShould I hate living my life inside the club\nShould I hate her for watching me for that reason\nShould I hate him for telling me that I'm season\nShould I hate them for telling me ball out\nShould I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about\nHatin' all money, power, respect in my will\nI'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real\n\n\"... I ain't trippin' off that Dominos anymore, just calling, sorry to hear what happen to your homeboy, but don't learn the hard way like I did homie\". \"Any nigga can kill a man, that don't make you a real nigga\". \"Realness is responsibility, realness is taking care of your motherfucking family, realness is god, nigga\"\n\n\n\"Alright that's all I wanted to tell you, just make sure you call us back when you get this message. Here go your mom.\"\n\"Boy you better have my jawn on full all this time you done had my damn car, but look I ain't tripping. Look, the neighbors say they seen you and your little friends over there by the food for less, and they was preaching to you over there telling you about the good book because right about now that's what ya'll need. Oh, and Top Dawg called the house too. I guess they want you and Dave to come to the studio. But look, you take this music business serious, and put out something me and your dad can step to. Shit, you know we from Chicago you know that's what we do.\"\n\nSing my song, it's all for you\n\n\"If I don't hear from you, by tomorrow... I hope you come back, and learn from your mistakes. Come back a man, tell your story to these black and brown kids in Compton. Let 'em know you was just like them, but you still rose from that dark place of violence, becoming a positive person. But when you do make it, give back, with your words of encouragement, and that's the best way to give back. To your city... And I love you Kendrick, if I don't hear you knocking on the door you know where I usually leave the key. Alright? talk to you later, bye.\"\n",
