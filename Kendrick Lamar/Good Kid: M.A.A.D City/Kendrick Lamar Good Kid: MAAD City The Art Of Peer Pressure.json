    "lyrics": "Everybody, everybody, everybody\nEverybody sit your bitch ass down and listen\nTo this true mothafuckin' story told by Kendrick Lamar on Rosecrans\nYa bish\nSmoking on the finest dope, aye aye aye aye\nDrank until I can't no more, aye aye aye aye\nReally I'm a sober soul but I'm with the homies right now\nAnd we ain't asking for no favors\nRush a nigga quick then laugh about it later, aye aye aye aye\nReally I'm a peacemaker but I'm with the homies right now\nAnd momma used to say\nOne day, it's gon' burn you out\nOne day, it's gon' burn you out, out\nOne day, it's gon' burn you out\nOne day, it's gon' burn you\nBut I'm with the homies right now\nMe and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota\nA quarter tank of gas, one pistol, and orange soda\nJanky stash box when the federales roll up\nBasketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor\nWe on the mission for bad bitches and trouble\nI hope the universe love you today\n\u2018Cause the energy we bringing sure to carry away\nA flock of positive activists and fill the body with hate\nIf it\u2019s necessary\nBumping Jeezy first album looking distracted\nSpeaking language only we know, you think is an accent\nThe windows roll down all I see is a hand pass it\nHotboxing like George Foreman grilling the masses\nOf the working world, we pulled up on a bunch of working girls\nAnd asked them what they working with \u2013 look at me\nI got the blunt in my mouth\nUsually I\u2019m drug-free, but shit I\u2019m with the homies\n(Yea nigga, we off a pill and Remy Red\nCome through and bust ya head nigga)\nMe and the homies\n(Sag all the way to the liquor store\nWhere my niggas pour up 4 and get twisted some more)\nMe and the homies\n(I ride for my mothafuckin\u2019 niggas\nHop out, do my stuff, then hop back in)\nMe and the homies\n(Matter fact, I hop out that mothafucka and be like\n\u201cDoo! Doo! Doo! Doo!...Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo!\u201d)\nIt\u2019s 2:30 and the sun is beaming\nAir conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screaming\nHungry for anything unhealthy and if nutrition can help me\nI\u2019ll tell you to suck my dick then I'll continue eating\nWe speeding on the 405 passing Westchester\nYou know the light skin girls in all the little dresses, good Lord\nThey knew we weren\u2019t from \u2018round there\n\u2018Cause every time we down there we pulling out the Boost Mobile SIM cards\nBougie bitches with no extensions\nHood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination\nBefore we sparked a conversation\nWe seen three niggas in colors we didn\u2019t like then started interrogating\nI never was a gangbanger, I mean I was never stranger to the folk neither\nI really doubt it\nRush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it\nThat\u2019s ironic \u2018cause I\u2019ve never been violent, until I\u2019m with the homies\n(Just ridin\u2019, just ridin\u2019)\nMe and the homies\n(Bullshittin\u2019, actin\u2019 a fool)\nMe and the homies\n(Trippin\u2019, really trippin\u2019)\nMe and the homies\n(Just ridin\u2019, just ridin\u2019, just ridin\u2019...)\nBragging \u2018bout the episode we just had\nA shot of Hennessey didn\u2019t make me feel that bad\nI\u2019m usually a true firm believer of bad karma\nConsequences from evil will make your past haunt you\nWe tryna conquer the city with disobedience\nQuick to turn it up, even if we ain\u2019t got the CD in\nBut Jeezy still playing and our attitude is still \u201cnigga, what is you saying\u201d\nPull in front of the house that we been camping out for like two months\nThe sun is going down as we take whatever we want\n(Ay, ay, nigga jackpot nigga, pop the safe\nAy nigga, I think it's somebody in this room\nWait, what?\nNigga, it's somebody in this room!)\nI hit the back window in search of any Nintendo\nDVDs, plasma screen TVs in the trunk\nWe made a right, then made a left, then made a right\nThen made a left, we was just circling life\nMy mama called \u2013 \"Hello? What you doin'?\" \u201cKicking it\u201d\nI should\u2019ve told her I\u2019m probably \u2018bout to catch my first offense with the homies\nBut they made a right, they made a left then made a right\nThen another right\nOne lucky night with the homies\nK. Dot, you faded, hood?\nYea we finally got that nigga faded. I think he hit the wrong blunt though\nOoh, which one?\nWell which one he talking 'bout? I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it\nI pray he ain't hit that\nNah, that nigga straight. He ain't hit that one\nGot the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans\nNigga I think we should push back to the city, fo real doe Nigga, for what?\nWhat that nigga, what's that Jeezy song say nigga?\n\"Last time I checked I was the man on these streets!\"\nYea, yea, that shit right there. I'm tryna be the nigga in the street\nThere he go. Man you don't even know how the shit go\nLook, here's the plan luv. We gon' use the kickback as a alibi.\nWait 'til the sun go down, roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van, at the park,\ncause I know he trying to fuck on Sherane tonight\nThat's what he\u2019s not gon' do. Then we all gon' meet back at the block at about 10:30\nThat's straight but we should meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on something too\nNigga sit yo dumb ass back down, nigga you ain't doing shit tonight\nMatter fact, nigga get in the mothafuckin' car. We finna get active\n",
