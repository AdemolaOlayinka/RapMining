Nigga you made it.\"\nSo I'm saying \"What up what up. Nigga I hate it.\"\nSo I'm saying \"What up what up. Nigga I hate it.\"\nFrustrated and I'm riding down the back streets\nMaking my conscious ask me\n\"Would I survive to make it up out this hole in time?\"\nBlack boy fly\nBlack boy fly\nBlack-black boy fly\nBlack boy fly\n\nI used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo\nI used to be jealous of Aaron Afflalo\nHe was the one to follow\nHe was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows\nHe would live in the gym\nWe was living in sorrow\nTotal envy of him\nHe made a dream become a reality\nActually making it possible to swim\nHis way out of Compton with further more to accomplish\nGraduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars\nIt's 2004 and I'm watching him score 30\nRemember vividly how them victory points had hurt me\nCause every basket was a reaction or a reminder\nThat we was just moving backwards\nThe bungalow where you find us\nThe art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast\nStick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math\nDetermination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom\nQualities he was given was the shit we didn't have\nDug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals\nHe had his back like a spinal meanwhile\nWe singing the same old song spinning the vinyl\n11 graders gone wrong\nHe focused on the NBA we focused on some Patron\nNow watch that black boy fly\n\nBlack boy fly\nWatch that black boy fly\nBlack boy fly\nWatch that black boy fly\nBlack boy fly\nWatch that black boy fly\nBlack boy...\n\nI used to jealous of Jayceon\nI used to jealous of Jayceon - Taylor when I was young\nTaylor made a career out of music from writing songs\nA Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn\nMoney laundering hustling, homies pondering up against\nSchemes to make a million even if doing you harm\nWar's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed\nThe city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn\nIts 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar\nFor the name of The Game they line in front of the store\nSwap meets selling our mixtapes I'm like oh shit, wait\nDon't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes\nMixed feelings was my opinion I was defending my insecurities\nChillin my conscience next to a villain\nCompton made you believe success wasn't real\nBe honest, none of us knew of a record deal\nSo as I peel through these lottery tickets\nI see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped\nA tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top\nHe was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block\nSo watch that black boy fly\n\n\nMy mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted\nLike most of the winners call it\nRegardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching\nThat's what she said but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan\nA Boy touring the country with money from mic recording\nThe only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype\nShooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40\nAnd shortly, I got discouraged\nLike every time I walked to the corner had them guns bursting\nNigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase\nOnly one in a million will ever see better days\nEspecially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis\nBreak your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy\nAll these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me\nThey all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me\nWhat am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle\nWhen 2 niggas making it out had never sounded logical\n3 niggas making it out, that's mission impossible\nSo I never believed the type of performance that I could do\nI wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got\nI was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly...\nOut of Compton\nThank God...\nBlack boy fly, watch that black boy fly\n",
