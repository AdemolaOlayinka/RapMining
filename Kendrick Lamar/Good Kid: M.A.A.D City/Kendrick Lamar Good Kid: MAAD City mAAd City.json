YAWK! YAWK!\"\n\n\"Man down. Where you from, nigga?\"\n\"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?\"\n\"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\"\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga\n\nBrace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane\nThis is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine\nThis is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain\nNot the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain\nIt was me, O-Boogy, Yaya, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans\nIt got ugly, waving your hand out the window. Check yo self\nUh, warriors and Conans\nHope euphoria can slow dance with society\nThe driver seat the first one to get killed\nSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out\nAt the same burger stand, where *censored* hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was looking at him different\nThat was back when I was nine\nJoey packed the nine\nPack to stand on every porch is fine\nWe adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time\nWith the sliding door, fuck is up?\nFuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up?\nYou fucking punk, picking up the fucking pump\nPicking off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch\nA wall of bullets coming from\nAK's, AR's, \"aye y'all. Duck.\"\nThat's what momma said when we was eating that free lunch\nAw man, God damn, all hell broke loose\nYou killed my cousin back in '94. Fuck yo truce\nNow crawl yo head in that noose\nYou wind up dead on the news\nAin't no peace treaty, just pieces\nBG's up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies\nIV's on top of IV's\nObviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys\nWhen you hop on that trolley\nMake sure your colors correct\nMake sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect\nThey say the governor collect, all of our taxes except\nWhen we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat\nYou moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a Tec\nGo buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess\nM.A.A.d city\n\n\"Man down\nWhere you from, nigga?\"\n\"Fuck who you know, where you from my nigga?\"\n\"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?\"\nThis m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga.\"\n\nIf Pirus and Crips all got along\nThey'd probably gun me down by the end of this song\nSeem like the whole city go against me\nEvery time I'm in the street I hear\n\n\"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!\n\nWake yo punk ass up!\nIt ain't nothing but a Compton thang\nChyea\nReal simple and plain\nI'm a teach you some lessons about the street\nIt ain't nothing but a Compton thang\nChyea\nHow we do\n\nFresh outta school cause I was a high school grad\nSleeping in the living room in my momma's pad\nReality struck I seen the white car crash\nHit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed\nMy Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him\nSecurity guard for a month and ended up leaving\nIn fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends\nTo stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in\nProjects tore up, gang signs get thrown up\nCocaine laced in marijuana\nAnd they wonder why I rarely smoke now\nImagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth\nI was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even\nI made a legion then made a promise to see you bleeding\nYou know the reasons but still won't ever know my life\nKendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice\n\nCocaine, weed\nNigga's been mixing shit since the 80's loc\nSherm sticks, butt nakeds\nDip\nMake a nigga flip\nCluck heads all up and down the block and shit\nOne time's crooked and shit\nBlock a nigga in\nAlondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton\nI'm still in the hood\nLoc yeah that's cool\nThe hood took me under so I follow the rules\nBut yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang\nAnd niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing\nPass it to the left so I can smoke on me\nA couple drive-bys in the hood lately\nCouple of IV's with the fucking spraycan\nShots in the crowd then everybody ran\nCrew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave\nShots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave\nMount up regulators in the whip\nDown the boulevard with the pistol grip\nTrip, we in the hood still\nSo loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real\nDeal with the outcome, a strap in the hand\nAnd a bird and 10 grand's where motherfuckers stand\n\nIf I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?\nOr see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street\nWith a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat\nIf I'm mashing all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?\nWould you say my intelligence now is great relief?\nAnd it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep\nWith dreams of being a lawyer or doctor\nInstead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage\nKill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn\nThey realizing the option of living a lie, drive they body with toxins\nConstantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame\nThat arrive in his eye; this a coward, the concept is aim and\nThey bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits\nAnd the price on his head, the tots probably go to the projects\nI live inside the belly of the rough\nCompton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what\n",
