No, just put us on death row\nJust give us some more guns, then give us some more coke\nThen give us another chair, then give us some more rope\nThen hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all\nBut ninety-percent unfair, care? Nah\nAlcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand\nwith intentions to expand, more prisons\nSo these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation\nThey for grossing a bigger business, imagine\nWe being used, imagine, the truth shall be told\n",
