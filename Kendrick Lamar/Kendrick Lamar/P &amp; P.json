Oh, what up?\nWell alright\n\nI'm going through something with life\nWhere pussy and Patron make you feel alright\nPussy and Patron make you feel alright\nPussy and Patron, that's some great advice\n\nWelcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs\nSomething to inspire me, rather than society's\nWoes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love\nI want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club\nI used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05\nThat bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job\nPushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans\nTrust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did\nGuilty by association, story of my life nigga!\nYou gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!\nPain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers\nHold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drench my pullover\nCycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin\nMaintaining my modest-modest as I dream\nSo while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it\nLife itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry\n\n\nI said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely\nSurrounded by the irony of living in the city\nI said they wouldn't hire me, I said I got my ass beat\nAnd the only thing can help is ass and some titties\nSo what's up baby? I said what's up?\nI had a long day and I really wanna fuck\nSee I ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees\nCapital One popping up on my caller I.D.\nPawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots\nWatching my vehicle break down on another man's block\nMan, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear?\nYou know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears\nOr run through a pothole at two in the morning\nScared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it\nSee I know, when the harsh reality takes toll\nOpen up your contacts, then scroll (\"hey what's up daddy? \")\n\n\nWelcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?\nFinna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram\nCrackers watch my every step, better yet they work my every nerve\nCutting me this worthless check, the concept is so absurd\nLike a church in debt, a turtle in a turtleneck\nConvertibles with turbo jets fueled by 7 Up and Prometh'\nI feel like death's around the corner like the quickest wide receiver\nSo I took another shot, tequila hit me like a nina (blaow!)\nMy sky's gray, my bitch is brighter\nAlways saying \"Lights Please\", J. Cole's her ghostwriter\nAnd I'm the God MC, join my diocese\nFree ya mind, don't mind so-ciety\nAnd finally, everyone got their own problems\nEverything's subject to change like broken dollars\nI'm a, drown in my drink and swim in woman's vagina\nLike a Pirahna fin, it gets harder than Rihanna when\n",
