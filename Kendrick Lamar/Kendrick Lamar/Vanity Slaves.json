    "lyrics": "Uh-uh-uh, what up?\nUh, I'm tryna, what up?\nUh-uh, I'm tryna get something\nUh-uh-uh, I'm tryna, what up?\nI say, what up?\nUh-uh, I'm tryna\nSometimes I wanna leave, sometimes I wanna cry\nSometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I wanna lie\nSometimes I wanna school the youth, sometimes I wanna ride\nSometimes I wanna not think, sometimes I wanna vibe\nSometimes I wanna bump Tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy\nthat's going wild inside, when my world collide\nwith your world where your girl and your kids reside\nWe kill the facades, we feel free to fly\nWe're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky\nI care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new\nif my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed\nI look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong\nInsecurity roams the black community\nHomes where kids must have jewelry\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nso she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reach the price scan\nthat's not about the right price, but more like the right scam\nto rule us all, confuse us all\nHit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw\nNow let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain\nin a Range that is not paid for\nMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a house\nthat lives around his neck like a white collar\nSo why fast forward? Then I rewind\nA time machine can help me double back to slavery times\nPicking cotton from a field that a white man own\nThe blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home\nNegro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity\nBefore your vanity they parted our families\nThey put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed\nThe more we were afraid, the more they made rules\nand trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake\nCouldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh!\nAnd school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts\nand a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar\nFour-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering\nFour-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation\nSee what we facing is now coming, back to the roots\nRemember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot?\nCall us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit\nof happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do\nThought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to\na modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie\nHer handbag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she foobie\nShe still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though\nWe filling up the gas for Rollies\nUpgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding Kobes\nMy cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya\nhe overcompensates for the life of his ancestors\nSo blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw\nThe reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss\nSlaves\nUh, I say the four-hundred years we never had nothing\nBarely had clothes on our back\nIt's the reason why when we get a little bit of change\nwe over-exaggerate on our living expenses\nSo if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger\nfour holes in your left ear and a nose piercing\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fo's on it\nand on the back of the window it says \"get on my level hoe\"\nYou're a vanity slave\nWe all vanity slaves\nand with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?\nI'm not from around here\nHey Ali, where we at? Idaho?\nYeah nigga, you know the first of the month\nYou know them checks come in\nI'm tryna get something, but what up?\n",
