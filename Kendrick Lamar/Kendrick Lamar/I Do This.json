Ooh wee\nThey say he something like the seventies, but I'm from '87\nWith a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens\nGourmet sneakers, hair nappy\nFucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro\nAnd I don't like 'em if the ass thin\nAnd I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend\nThe fuck I look like?\nA billion bucks, and that's why\n\nThe homies say I'm the truest\nThe bitches think I'm the cutest\nThe definition what cool is\nBoy, I thought you knew this\nBitch I do this\nBitch I do this\nBitch I do this\nThe definition what cool is\nBoy, I thought you knew this\nBitch I do this\n\nShe looking at the car like she wanna fuck it\nShe looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it\nHating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it\nShe say she on birth control, no I don't trust it, hoe\nUh, so give me fifty feet champ\nRun until I got a bunion and my feet cramp\nI'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp\nAnd I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp\nYou niggas' check's cash\nAnd I'm GT crashing, 1-0-5 off rap\nAy, that lil' nigga got it going on\nG5, going-going-going gone\nCloud nine mind state\nI drop a record, then I raise the crime rate\nKilling this shit, where's your funeral tie?\nA-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck, skip to Y\n\n\nShe looking at the car like she wanna fuck it\nShe looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it\nHating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it\nSay she on birth control, no I don't trust it\nAooow~! First off, I'm a rider bitch\nPut them twenty-sixes on a Silverado bitch\nI keep my bitch with a finer bitch\nSnap my fingers, she'll go and find a bitch\nTell them fuck boys that I do this\nGot the best product round town, Frank Lucas\nConfuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up\nOkay, Subway bread like some cold cuts\nAnd I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy\nWild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti\nFuck you, pay me, paper over pussy nigga\nWhen I drop, you ain't getting paper nor pussy nigga\n\nBitch I do this\nBitch I do this\nThe definition what cool is\nBoy, I thought you knew this\nBitch I do this\n",
