You ugly\nEverybody just clap your hands if you're real\nMiddle finger up, give a fuck how they feel\nBe yourself, just show me you're real\nMiddle fingers up\n\nJust let me be me, hmm\nThat's the only way I know\nJust let me be me, hmm\nThat's the only way I know\n(That's the only way I know how to hold it down\nThat's-that's the only way I know how to hold it down)\nUh, I just wanna be me\nNo disrespect, but motherfuck you\nMy education stopped at a high school degree\nbut I can outsmart any high IQ\nDraped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum\nCold, my style making my nose run\nOh, I stare at the mirror, then realize\nthat real lies, within me\nSome say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink\nAsk too many questions about the stars and Earth shit\nRather be in the studio than out buying drinks\nSo if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit\nAnd California on that jerk shit\nBut I'd just rather two-step like my first steps\nJill Scott in my iPod as my head rests, yes\n\nAnd yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali'\nBut I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis\nAnd skinny jeans ain't quite the lick\nI probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit\nHa-ha-ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?\nStale face, play me short like an Oompa-Loompa\nYou ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids\nWon't you lighten up like Michael did?\nI grew up with killers man, people who killed man\nBut my character never could be like them man\nAnd they respect that, say that I'm real man\nNot a fake person, that's the Sims man\nLive my life through some film man?\nI ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows\ncause they know they'll know Kendrick fo' sho', and oh\n\nAlmost lost my life to the industry\nHad to look through a photo book to remember me\nThese label heads ain't nothing but bullshit\nHave you with professional killers, chasing hits\nLying to yourself all over an image\nMaking records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance\nMy mama said, boy that don't sound like you\nI said, this is the sound though, my only excuse\nQuite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie\nand kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me\nThe reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me\nAnd you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth\nA diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter\nWatching Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner\nSee I give you my life to mix it up in a blender\nto make sure that you feel it\n\n\nKendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?\nKendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?\nIs this really you? Is this who you are?\nWhat are you trying to say?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?\nWho are you?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?\nKendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?\nWhat are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?\nI think that I finally reached the pinnacle\nof finding myself as an individual\nThe world is so typical\nI just wanna be higher than that\nI used to want to be the messiah of rap\nInfatuated with becoming a relevant star\nTrying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars\nthat I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad\nVanity, they say that it can damage me\nSo do I really want it?\nIf I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect\nThat means I'll be fronting, hmm\nCooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story\nthat the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me\nKnowing that I'm misunderstood\nSo I gotta get my point across like a snitch would\nAnd I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there\nor try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair\nAnd Dame said he proud of my newfound honesty\nand all I could say is, will the radio care?\nYeah, or should I say no?\nOr should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?\nYou heard my Hip Hop when I was sixteen years old\nWell that was me then, now I'm an adult\nTwenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined\nbut with the smallest of funds to show, but I'm not worried\nMy talent should take me places I've never been\nThe world should turn soon as my record spin\nI wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit\nThe negative you bring, the stress, the violence\nThe capital punishment, the loud police sirens\nToo focussed, one word, righteous\nAnd this is Kendrick Lamar\nand soon y'all know cloud nine y'all\nAnd that means I wanna be the highest\nToo focussed, one word (righteous)\nMm, yeah\nThat means I wanna be the highest\nToo focussed, one word\n\nToo focussed, too focussed, one word\nToo focussed, too focussed, one word\nToo focussed, too focussed, one word\nToo focussed, one word\nToo focussed, too focussed, one word\n",
