    "lyrics": "\"I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible\nbecause it will reveal to you why it is true\nthat whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve\nregardless of how many times you have failed in the past\nor how lofty your aims and hopes may be\"\n\nGo getter, with no cheddar\nJust a white tee and a swap meet sweater\nMy life is likely to see great endeavors\nBut I can't win if I can't get it together\nWhat I gotta do in order to see success?\nHaving the world's best to call me the best\nPull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed\nwith an address next to a beautiful actress\nA dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole\nWord to the hole in my pocket and the hoes\nthat don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition\nBut the last I checked, y'all was broke bitches\nMake a name for myself\nthen bubble like the ass of Buffy when she wearing a tight belt\nThe homies on the block can say whatever they say\nI don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates\n\nTake your time, it'll come\nJust stay focussed and humble my son\nShow and prove, prove you're the one\nIt's not about who's dope, it's who wants it the most\nSo just go out and get it\nGo out and get it\nGo out and get it\nGo out and get it\n\nWhat I gotta do in order to see success?\nHaving the world's best to call me the best\nPull up at the Grammy Awards as best-dressed\nwith an address next to a beautiful actress\nDo I gotta run in your spot and blasting?\nBetter yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing\nHear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging\nCatch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon\nOr maybe I gotta hook up with Jose\nCop five bricks of the yay, head to the Bay\nArea, or carry the birds to the gate\nLet the clips distribute the work all day\nThen come back home\nEvery three weeks, flip three-to-six zones\nHomies on the block can say whatever they want\nI don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump\nDonald that is\n\n\nAnd when I do it, I do it again, then I go back\nWhen I do it, I'll do it again, then I go back\nThug it out, but for now I'm willing to dug it out\nI gotta grind, grind\n\nSo welcome to the story of my life\nSee I'm tryna get right off the shit that I write\nMake a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and the wife\nPop's engine in this old school run tight!\nBut as you listening to K. D-O-T\nMe and my girl split the bucket at KFC\nShe listening to Drake and all I can say\nDamn, these niggas that much better than me?\nBaby, I don't think this is meant to be\ncause I'm always losing self-esteem\nShe paused the iPhone, then said huh\nI repeated what I said, then she replied shut up\nYou know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it\nBut don't forget when you do, just keep you in it\nAnd never listen to what the industry say\nDon't be a typical artist, be more like Jay\nRussell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones\nBob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid\nYoung black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah\nSo I gotta see success\nI gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps\nRising to the top like a soda shook up\nBout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way\n\n\nYeah, I swear to God I don't wanna do it, just live man\nI wanna live good\nJust wanna make my momma proud, y'know?\nI don't wanna be hard, I don't want the most stripes\nI got lil' brothers and sisters man, I'm the oldest nigga\nI just want it, I just want it\nand I'ma get it\n",
