    "lyrics": "A nigga so goddamn stressed out\nI feel like fuck everything right now\nSee I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life\nBut I'll be damned if I give 'em a handout\nSee my pride is one thing I will not put aside\nI'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye\nIf I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried\nWhat? Uh\n\nYou ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?\nNot your momma, your poppa, only person is you\nNot your brother, your sister, the only person is you\nYou ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?\nNobody, nobody but you\nSo it feels like, like it's only you\n\nSo I'm feeling like I want to, I want to\nI want to, I want to go so far from here\nVery, very far from here\nI need to, I need to\nI need to, I need to go so far from here\nVery, very far from here\n\nIt seems like, you can't win for losing\nWhatever you're doing turns out to be \"what-are-you-doing?\"\nSitting pursuing, but your time will soon come\nNobody knows the position that you in\nBut it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing\nThat feeling, hard to explain\nWhen you just, just want to get away\nSomething like\n\n\n\nAway from it all\nTake me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit\nThe smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision\nI'm stuck on the studio couch, now I'm thinking bout my daughter\nTimes is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered\nJust press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order\ninstead of problem solving\nFrom my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride\nSet some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes\nReaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud\nShitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread\nas I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony\nNothing is surrounding me, living my life\nThough it's better to write\nConfiguring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light\nSo how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real\nA Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar\n",
