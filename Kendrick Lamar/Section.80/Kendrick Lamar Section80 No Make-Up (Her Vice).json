It was early in the morn'\nShe resembled a model out of a MAC book\nConcentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens\nI stand behind her and try to figure her vision\nof prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone\nHer complexion in a direction I've outgrown\nDamn girl, why so much?\nYou bout to blow your cover when you cover up\nDon't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing\nFrom Heaven is where you got it from\nI love your smile, you can do it without style\nFrom your lips, all the way to your eyebrows\nIt's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur\nI don't see it, all I see is a blur\n\n\nI know she bout to ask me how she look\nI tell her beautiful, and how long it took\nfor you to put it on? It was early in the morn'\nShe resembled a model out of a MAC book\n(Concentrating on the way my) eyeliner thickens\n(He stand behind me and try to) figure her vision\n(of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone\nMy complexion in a direction) I've outgrown\n(I feel like it's not enough\nI can never put on too much makeup\nYeah I know) your imperfections (I be constantly stressing\nFrom him is where I get it from)\nThey tell me I need to) smile (at least once in a while\nI hate my lips, my nose, my) eyebrows\n(It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see\nis that I had a black eye)\nTo be continued, eleven\n\"Ladies and gentlemen\"\nAnd you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou ain't gotta get drunk to have fun\nAnd you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun\nYou ain't gotta get drunk to have fun\n",
