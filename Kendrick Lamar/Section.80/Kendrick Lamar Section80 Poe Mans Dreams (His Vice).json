Church is definitely on the move\nand we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far\nAs I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar\nYou know what I'm talking bout?\nThis is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking bout?\nYou gotta get up off your ass and get it man\nThat's the only way your pockets gonna expand\nI tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking bout?\nApply yourself to supply your wealth\nOnly limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself\nChurch is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking bout?\nExercise your ism and don't depend on no one else\nCathedral, chuuch! Ism\n",
