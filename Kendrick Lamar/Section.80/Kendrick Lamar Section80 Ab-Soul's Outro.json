    "lyrics": "What's your life about? Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nThere's fire in the street, fire in the swisher\nFire in between the two legs of your lil' sister\nJust get a sip of this elixir\nbefore they crop us out the picture\nI've never seen a crop circle\nbut I've cops circle the block, I puff squares\nBut I swear one day I'ma stop, my nerves itch\nOn the brink of my career while my peers struggle for employment\nCan you hear these screams? (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)\nOne, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy\nA bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary\n\nSection 80's babies, blame Ronald Reagan\nWe raising hell\n\nLord forbid\nThe homie got wet, so we tryna soak it in\nThe president is black, but you can't vote for skin\nYou vote for the better man\nCome to our show, you can see the diversity\nUnify the people, they gon' peep it universally\nWe might not change the world, but we gon' manipulate it\nI hope you participating\nAiyyo Dot, won't you let these cats know?\nWe knew we'd be here like back in '04\nStarted HiiiPoWeR because our generation needed a generator\nand the system made to disintegrate us\nAnd all we do is assist 'em\nWe're not victors, we're victims\nThe bigger picture isn't developed yet\nLike, what if kids were celibate?\nOr what is Tammy came across a real man\nwho didn't play games like chil-dren?\nMy nigga cheated on his girlfriend\nwith his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end\nAnd everybody tripping off twenty-twelve\nand the extraterrestrial presence as well\n(Odd Future's aight) but our future's not\nThat martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got\nSo keep that question mark on your face\nEat your fast-food, use your fluoride toothpaste\nHide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine-to-five\nDon't forget to pay your tithes, and thank God you alive (HiiiPoWeR)\nAnd on another note\nwe focussed like the Hubble Telescope, 'Soul\n\nLife is a traffic jam (life is a traffic jam)\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam (ready to go)\nLife is a traffic jam (ready to go)\nLife is a traffic jam (ready to go)\nLife is a traffic jam\nLife is a traffic jam\n\nI wrote this because I was ordered to\nPeople say I speak for generation Y\nWhy lie? I do\nSection 80, your son will play me if radio won't\nDaughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to Kendrick\nFor instance\n\nWhat's your life about? Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nTake out that student loan and pay off your college degree\nand do exactly what you see on TV\n\nTrue story\nHmm, can you repeat that for me 'Soul?\n\nWhat's your life about? Enlighten me\nIs you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?\nIs you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?\nThe time is now my child, come on\n\nSee a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar\nbecause you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history\nall in the same sentence\nYou know what all them things have in common?\nOnly half of the truth if you tell it\nSee I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers\ntill one day I realised I had to come up with my own\nI'm not on the outside looking in, I'm not on inside looking out\nI'm in the dead fucking centre looking around\nYou ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?\nThat's an analogy for the way the world make me react\nMy innocence been dead\nSo the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God and history\nall in the same sentence\njust know I meant it, and you felt it\ncause you too are searching for answers\nI'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially aware rapper\nI am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation\nKendrick Lamar\nNow fuck 'em up Terrace\n('Soul!)\n\nI watch this fire that we're gathered around\nand see that it burns similar to the fire that burns inside you\nSection 80, Section 80 babies\nA generation of bliss and disobedience\nNo they can't control us, no they can't control you\nNo they can't control us, but we control each other\nWe build our own world\nIf you don't leave with nothing else tonight, you will leave with knowing yourself\nYou will leave knowing you represent something that's bigger than all of us\nor our family\nHeart, honor and represent\nThis is you, this is me, and we are HiiiPoWeR\n",
