We never do listen\nUnless it comes with an 808\nA melody and some hoes\nPlayStation and some drank\nTechnology bought my soul\nLooking around and all I see\nIs a big crowd, that's product of me\nAnd they probably relatives\nRelevant for a rebel's dream\nYep, the president is black\nShe black too\nPurple label on her back\nBut that tab\nIs light blue she take it straight to the head\nThen she look at me\nShe got ADHD\n8 doobies to the face\nFuck that\n12 bottles in the case\nNigga, fuck that\n2 pills and a half weight\nNigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance\nWhen your age don't exist\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nDon't got a limit just gimme some more with it\nDon't got a limit just gimme some more with it\nThey always told me ADHD did it\nAnd then she started\nAnd then she started\nFeeling herself like no on else in this apartment\nBeg you pardon\nOh, I rap, baby. How old are you?\nShe say 22, I say 23\nOK then we all crack babies\nDamn, why you say that?\nShe said where my drink at?\nI'm a tell you later, just tell your neighbors\nHave the police relax\nI stood up, shut the blinds\nClosed the screen, jumbotron\nMade it to the back, where she reside\nThen she said, read between the lines\nYep, hope that I get close enough\nWhen the lights turn down\nAnd the fact that she just might open up\nWhen the new flow start to drown\nHer body and I, know the both of us really deep in the move now\nIt's nothing we can do now\nSomebody walked in with a pound\nOf that Bay Area kush\nShe looked at me then looked\nAt it, then she grabbed it\nThen she said, get it understood\nYou know why we crack babies\nBecause we born in the 80s\nThat ADHD crazy\nFuck that\n8 doobies to the face\nFuck that\n12 bottles in the case\nNigga, fuck that\n2 pills and a half weight\nNigga, fuck that\nGot a high tolerance\nWhen your age don't exist\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nLike whoa oh oh whoa\nDon't got a limit just gimme some more with it\nDon't got a limit just gimme some more with it\nThey always told me ADHD did it\nYou can have all my shine\nI'll give you the light\nDouble cup, deuce, four, six\nJust mix it in Sprite\nEcstasy, 'shrooms, blow, dro, hoes\nWhatever you like\nYou can have all my shine\nI'll give you the light\n",
