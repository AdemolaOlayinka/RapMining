Let's see\nIs it in the clouds like they said it would be?\nI wonder when I die will he give me receipts?\nI wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?\nLook at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner\nI'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner\nI'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer\nWhat I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just\n\n\nIt go one, two, three\nTwo in the front, one in the back seat, seat\nSeat, seat, looking for a victim of an AK-47\nHundred round each, each, each\nBut why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?\nI don't know, I look for the answers later\nMake a right, there they go, sometimes gotta\n\n\nAs I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer\nMy plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons\nI'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the Heavens\nA condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11\nThat's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right\nBut I'm right on the edge on Everest and I might jump tonight\nHave you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?\nWell it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking lie\nWhen I lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray\nI wonder if I'm just a villain dealing my morals away\nSome people look at my face, then tell me don't worry bout it\nI give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence\nI'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngun with lack of guidance\nThere's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence\nLook at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest\nThat's on my life, but regardless I'ma\n\n\nYeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya\nOn the day Niko had that seizure, I lost one of my biggest believers, ohh\nClose deaths make you think about your life\nlike if I had the same chance twice, what would I do different?\nI'd tell her I loved her more, do more\nbut tease her bout crying on that picture\nNow when I'm done recording, swear I let the beat bang in her name\nMake her shake her head in Heaven saying they at it again\nMake them clouds turn to speakers\nDon't take too much smoke from the reefer\nLove being in the room with her peoples\nNow my love life murking it, family having surgeries\nHate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me\nLord, what kind of life is this?\nMama, I just wanna sing\nMama said, according to get everything\nyou gotta risk everything\nSo I'm smoking my kush reading Corinthians\nSmoking my kush reading Corinthians\nSmoking my kush reading Corinthians\nSmoking my kush reading Corinthians\n",
