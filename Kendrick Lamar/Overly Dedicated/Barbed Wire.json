    "lyrics": "One time\nReporting live, Compton, California\nHave you ever felt like, like you never get life?\nLike you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep\nBack down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep\nChasing for the win but you never win the track meet\nOh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter\nand life's a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her\nI struck enough pain, let her know I wasn't playing\nI was so (Sincere) like Nas' first name\nAnd back, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five\nand if I survive I probably wouldn't sell it\nMy opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats\nin the ghetto, rather in some heals like Giuseppe's\nThey want me unemployed, until I hit the streets\nfor filling voids of broke D-boys selling weed\nFucking up my prestige, till I live with the blues\nB.B. King or the neighbors of Snoop\n\nThat's why I'm in the club like fuck it though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say I can't live comfortable\nI'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\n(Through the barbed wire)\n{We are, we are fighters\nWe are, we are true\nThrough the, through barbed wires\nWe will, will break through}\nSo while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass\nCelebrate the very day that I get past\n(Through the barbed wire)\n\nHave you ever felt like, like you never get life?\nLike you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep\nTryna get away from the world stereotype\nBarbed wire got a barricade on your destiny\nShe desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying\nShe gon' have a baby, then flee from her education\nAt the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes\nSee a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality\nShe will never get by, no how, no way\nWelfare recipient, property of the state\nHousing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute\nThe owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute\nHoodrat trashy, six baby daddies\nand this baby daddy is new to the family\nChilling in pajamies, waiting on the first\nFast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur\n\nThat's why she in the club like fuck it though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say she can't live comfortable\nShe gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\n(Through the barbed wire)\n{We are, we are fighters\nWe are, we are true\nThrough the, through barbed wires\nWe will, will break through}\nSo while she up in V.I.P. pouring Merlot in her glass\nCelebrate the very day that she get past\n(Through the barbed wire)\n\nHave you ever felt like you finally got life?\nYou finally got right? No longer a black sheep\nLiving off your (dreams) like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat\nof a convertible, eloping to get married\nWhat a feeling of overcoming the odds\nIt's like you just hit the lottery, my God\nThere must be a God, cause golly\nyou done made it through the fight while squabbling, Ali\nNow your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops\nand you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks\nAnd she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar\nMaking good decisions, got an independent business mind\nAnd both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way\nJust tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day\nBut they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth\nYou must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out\n\nIn the club like fuck it though\nThey say it's only one life, life, life\nAnd if you say they can't live comfortable\nThey gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie\nSo even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad\nKnow it's some barbed wire that's always in your path\n(Through the barbed wire)\n\nJust laugh, then everybody say\n\nCause I won't get caught again\nand I'm here to start the trend\nYou can't catch me if you try\nDisappear into the night, and I'm gone\n\n\"So you made it past all the barbed wires?\"\nJust one more left\n",
