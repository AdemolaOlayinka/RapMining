Then tell me why you constant stressing\non how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?\nI function with you and you flaunt your pistol\nEvery second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal\nWhere so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing\nWho baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend\nThat shit is mad depressing, bringing me down\nSpeak on something with some substance that can get us both paid\nrather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style\nor his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off\n\nCause every time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... scary ass\nEvery time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star\nI'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art\nNow paint that picture, life behind bars\nRemember the very day I got caught?\nI murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?\nSee what I was taught, family is all I need\nBut indeed, them too can run me right up a tree\nConstantly talking shit bout the next relative\nWanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in\nEver since grandma died everyone parted ways\nArgue on holidays, left my uncle in prison\nFor fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms\nYeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come\nCome to my house just to yap about your own people, dang\nAnd if your blood wasn't running through my veins\nI would probably cut y'all off, too, yep\n\nCause every time you come around y'all be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... keep it running Ali\nEvery time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say\nSo tell 'em shut the fuck up\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nYeah bitch you boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nYeah nigga you boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nYou thirsty, you boo-boo\nYou T, you turned down\nYou boo-boo, you T\nYou boo-boo, you turned down\nYou thirsty, you T\nYou boo-boo, you turned down\nYou boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you weak\nYou weak, yo' bitch weak\nYeah\nYou boo-boo, you T\nKeep all that\n\nWhat is HiiiPoWeR?\nHiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live\nSee it's known today that the human race is nothing\nNo moral, no standards\nWhat we're about to do is raise the level of expectations\nNo you don't have to have a lot of money\nYou don't have to be rich\nBut you will be rich in mind and spirit\nSome say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang\nHiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion\n",
