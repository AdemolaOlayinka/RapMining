    "lyrics": "Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh\nAli, you thirsty on Twitter\nYou boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nYou boo-boo\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar\nI read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God\nThey say he the key to my blessings\nand if I speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock\nMoney flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock\nAnd by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed\nlike a small garage in your backyard\nI'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine\nBut I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness\nAlways hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with\nWho she wanna fight, who wearing a weave\nWho Dooney & Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys\nto the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who\nand who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves\nBut before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'ma cut you off\n\nCause every time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... hoe\nEvery time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me\nor at least inquire similar desires\nto do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P\nI'm talking ideas, motivation\nIt's more than making enemies my nigga\nOh, that's not your memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing\non how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga?\nI function with you and you flaunt your pistol\nEvery second tell me how you pressed him at the Monte Crystal\nWhere so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing\nWho baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend\nThat shit is mad depressing, bringing me down\nSpeak on something with some substance that can get us both paid\nrather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style\nor his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off\n\nCause every time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... scary ass\nEvery time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say\nUh, I'm tryna learn something new\nI'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star\nI'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa, studying art\nNow paint that picture, life behind bars\nRemember the very day I got caught?\nI murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?\nSee what I was taught, family is all I need\nBut indeed, them too can run me right up a tree\nConstantly talking shit bout the next relative\nWanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in\nEver since grandma died everyone parted ways\nArgue on holidays, left my uncle in prison\nFor fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms\nYeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come\nCome to my house just to yap about your own people, dang\nAnd if your blood wasn't running through my veins\nI would probably cut y'all off, too, yep\n\nCause every time you come around y'all be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say, oh my God\nShut the fuck up... keep it running Ali\nEvery time you come around you be hollering that\nwhoop-de-whoop, blase-blah\nHe say, she say\nSo tell 'em shut the fuck up\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nYeah bitch you boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nTell 'em shut the fuck up\nYeah nigga you boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you thirsty\nYou thirsty, you boo-boo\nYou T, you turned down\nYou boo-boo, you T\nYou boo-boo, you turned down\nYou thirsty, you T\nYou boo-boo, you turned down\nYou boo-boo, you T\nYou turned down, you weak\nYou weak, yo' bitch weak\nYeah\nYou boo-boo, you T\nKeep all that\n\nWhat is HiiiPoWeR?\nHiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live\nSee it's known today that the human race is nothing\nNo moral, no standards\nWhat we're about to do is raise the level of expectations\nNo you don't have to have a lot of money\nYou don't have to be rich\nBut you will be rich in mind and spirit\nSome say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang\nHiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion\n",
