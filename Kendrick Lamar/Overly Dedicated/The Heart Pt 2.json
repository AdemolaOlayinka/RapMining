    "lyrics": "2010)\nI'll tell you what I don't believe in, can I do that?\nAlright, I don't believe in the, in laws, or the system by any means, whatsoever\nI try not to obey them at any time\nThat's what I believe in, not believing in\n(So what keeps you alive?)\nFour big bottles of water a day, two packs of Marlboro Reds and\nuh, what keeps me alive? Shit, um\nMusic, I have to listen to music all day long\nI say that keeps me going\nI'm a pretty dark person, I've thought about ending it a million times\nand I have to say that music keeps me here, by far, the main thing\n\nThank you\nSitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go\nright now, freestyle or write down, whatever\nAnd still I come up clever, I just need to free my thoughts\nand Lord knows that I know better, but I ain't perfect\nI ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses\nYou should either hear me now or go deaf\nor end up dead, die trying and know death\nMight end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath\nFuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga\nI mean that from the bottom of my heart\nYou see my art is all I have, and victory tastes sweet\neven when the enemy can throw salt\nStill knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car\nLet bygones be bygones, but where I'm from\nwe buy guns and more guns to give to the young\nI'm living the life of a nigga trapped nigga\ninside the system, all you envision is trap niggas\nMy uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight\nHe told me rap about life, not rap, niggas\nThat's why I'm shaking my head when you rap dissing\nMy stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching\nI start evaluating, then my final intuition\nis that you wishing a come up, would just come up\nWe used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse\nNiggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre\nAnd this is Compton, lions in the land of the triumph\nWrap Saran our defiance, ban our alliance\nPut burners in the hands of the black man\nOne hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned Kobe Bryant\nYou probably heard I wanna be heard and wonder who I am\nYou probably even listen to \"Faith\" and think I know Zion\nBut really I'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth\nbecause it seem like it's always clashing with science\nI got a big fear of flying\nMy future so bright I'd probably go blind before I blink twice, I ain't lying\nI swear to God half of y'all just don't know Kendrick\nThe school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance\nYou walking down the block, he got shot, you wouldn't know I witnessed\nYou just mind your bidness\nYou just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennises\nIt's kinda scary ain't it\nYou can't act like no bitch, that only got Tyler Perry famous\nJust let me explain this, why you pick up that stainless?\nCause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him\nso much, you probably had your burner tucked in graduation\nSaid if you see him on them bleachers then you kill him, facing\ntwenty-five to life with a murder charge\nYour enemies was the prey, and now you pray to God\nI pray these bars get farther than Compton\nAnd if my record never break I still won't break my promise, I promise to keep it honest\nSecret society, all we ask is trust\nand all we lack is communication like service sucks\nThe people scared of annihilation when Kingdom Come\nAnd I'm like, the Kendrick Lamar O.D. in less than a month\nAlright? Gotta keep it pushing\nCan't let the government tell me how my future looking\nI'm on Rosecrans & Central trying to duck the central bookings\nIf the fucking pigs get behind me then you know I'm bucking, never will I surrender\nI've been a warrior when I came out of my mom's placenta\nIn the gutter lane like I'm Master Splinter\nHow splendid, I guess my project had did it\nGot all these niggas approaching their mixtapes different\nThey said seven tracks, I said fifteen\nCalled it an EP, they said I'm tripping\nBut little did they know, I'm tryna change the rules\nthat we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions\nUppity bitches, handling bidness\nKilling our dreams, stealing our vision\nOut in Haiti adolescents barely have a home\nIn L.A. everybody think they fucking on\nHop on Twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit\nWho we hanging with, and bragging about the iPhone\nI swear to God, most y'all cats just don't know Kendrick\nYou barely know yourself, so I guess most of y'all should be offended\nAin't doing this for my health, I'm just trying to purchase my momma them businesses\nOccupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's\njust to coincide, just to go inside, books we idolize while we living\nLook the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time, just to mastermind\nJust to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the...\n\nWe would like to call this an appreciation tape\nfor those who recognized the Kendrick Lamar EP\nFor this is the Kendrick Lamar O.D.\nBecause of you, we are Overly Dedicated\n",
