Uh-huh\nYou see this game we play come from uncles that raised me in Compton\nAsk me what I have accomplished\nI don't know I don't have conscience\nI just load up and start dumpin' on enemies I'm head hunting\nNo sympathy, ain't no love when you in these streets just get something\nProtect ya neck cause they comin' for set respects split your onion\nThen chop your deck your head tumblin' like gymnastics\nCause ignorance is bliss\n\nThis the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off\nWe all tryna ball and when I got the rock I'll dish off\nUntil the day I pistol whip you posers till ya'll pissed off\nThen peel off, in a hooptie\nCome back and make these niggas wanna shoot me\nAnd they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me\nIndubitably I'm too street\nIndubitably I'm a do me\nBetter than your bitch would\nBut you niggas too weak, but just give me 2 weeks\nAnd I'm good\nI'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm\nMake Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent\nNo tarot card reading I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish\nNot only from the rap game, I'm including the planet\nCats so watered down clowns can sink Titanic\nTie titanium around their neck and watch em panic\nGive me respect, dammit, or get damaged\nDie young, corpse identified by your parents\nApparently you a parrot\nMocking me and my blueprint\nBut I won't share it just make you cop it then call you a sheriff\nStop it, I'm hearin' the comments\nThe critics are calling me conscious\nBut truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton\nSo truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?\nProves, that ignorance is bliss\n\nAnd this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far\nAnd I'm this far, from a discharge but never will I dish off\nThis my world, I grab the universe then play kickball\nAnd they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard\nI'm so-Cal, you so called\nRappers need to go call\nGhostbusters to shoot busters I'm Casper when I go off\nI show up, to show out to show off\nYou a hundred percent behind me\nAnd if you hard then wreck your car and walk up to my crime scene\nI remember being 17 wishing someone would sign me\nNow the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me\nBackin' down boggins\nBackin' down bitches\nWe gon' flip her once she off that blue dolphin\nYou gon' tip her\nCause ignorance is bliss\nAnd Willy B I'm a fool on yo beats, I bleed out the speaker\nAs the speaker that spoke when they done speak\n",
