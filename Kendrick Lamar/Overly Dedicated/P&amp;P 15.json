Oh, what up?\nI said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?\nI said, oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?\nWell alright\n\nI'm going through something with life\nwhere pussy and Patron make you feel alright\nPussy and Patron make you feel alright\nPussy and Patron, that's some great advice\n\nWelcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs\nSomething to inspire me, rather than society's\nwoes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love\nI want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player's Club\nI used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05\nThat bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, I had no job\nPushing in my mama van, stop for gas on Rosecrans\nTrust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did\nGuilty by association, story of my life nigga!\nYou gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga!\nPain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at Louie's Burgers\nHold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover\nCycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin\nMaintaining my modest-modest as I dream\nSo while I go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it\nLife itself, I know it helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry (\"hey what's up daddy?\")\n\n\n\"So what you wish me over here for?\nHow was your day?\nAre you tipsy?\"\nMhmm\n\nAll I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron\nGive me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on\nBitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw\nComing down clean, tell your baby mama what it do\nWhere your friends at? I got long dick, what it is\nGo on poke it out, situate your little positives\nHow I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready\nI'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me\nWhen you let me, when you let me...\n\nGive me that funk, that sweet, that nasty\nThat good shit stuff\nI can't get enough\nIf I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe\nGive me that funk, that sweet, that nasty\nThat good shit stuff\nI can't get enough\nIf I offend you...\n\nUh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home\nand caught that flat in the flats\nAnd it made me think when another car blinked\nto change locations where we at\nWe often get lost in the ever-hard bottle\nwhen attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow\nJust for a minute, then back to the bullshit\nYour car now due and you bout to get evicted\nTwo drugs surely, Patron, pussy, make it feel alright\nBut once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life\nYou can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga\nThe antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga\nBut still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign\n\n\nOkay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?\nFinna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram\nCrackers watch my every step, man I hate to work for them\nOne time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me\nAnd here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man\nWhat to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it\nPop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open\nBust that pussy open, bust that pussy open\n'Soul, balls deep, ya dig?\nRetrieve relief, ya dig?\nLet's kill a bottle of tequila\nand lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?\nWhat's up? I had a long day and I really want to fuck\nTake a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day\ncause all I've been thinking the whole day...\n\n\nAll I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patron\nGive me that, won't you give that? Once again it's on\nBitch I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw\nComing down clean, tell your baby mama what it do\nWhere your friends at? I got long dick, what it is\nGo on poke it out, situate your little positives\nHow I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready\nI'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me\nWhen you let me, when you let me...\n",
