We should be growing now\n\nSmoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga\n\n\nThat's what she said to me\nThat place I used to call home is just a bed to me\nand we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep\nMeanwhile I'm in these streets with everybody\nI'm trying to get it and she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me\nAs they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness\nLook each other in the face and barely blink\nI tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink\nSo if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync\n\n\nThat's what it said to me\nBut that place I call ambition now dead to me\nGone and forgotten, I'm off track like Dale Earnhardt\nMy liver rotten, alcoholic tripping\nFucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions\nClub night, guys and dolls\nBalling out, but I'm bout to drop the ball\nI'm calling out for help, my engineer called\nTold me come to the studio, I wanna tell him nah\n\n\nThat's what he said to me\nBut that place we call Heaven unfair to me\nOnly a hundred and forty-four can go\nSeven billion people on planet earth today\nIs there something that I don't know?\nI know to follow him, rather following people\nor follow vanity cause that means I'm following evil\nGuess I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral\nBlessings I need, but live like I don't need you\n\n\nSo in conclusion\nWe all seem to stumble, planning our own demise\nForgetting the big picture and making it wallet size\nSo to what's important in my life, I apologize\nI promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified\nWe all get distracted\nThe question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards?\nWould you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life\nAnd if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight\n\nI'm trying to visualize how to get it right\nBut my vision's so blurry\nTrying to slow it down, stay close to the ground\nBut we're always in a hurry now\nAnd if I could make this world stand a little slower\nThen I would, then we could grow a little closer\nI think we're getting closer\nI think we're getting closer\n",
