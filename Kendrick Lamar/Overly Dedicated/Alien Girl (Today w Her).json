No I.D., that girl's an alien\nAnd if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space\nU-F-O fly away\nSo let's go-go-go-go, let's go-go-go-go\nLet's go-go-go-go, let's go, let's go\n\nUh, she got me going, I'm all in\nFifty stories, I'm falling\nWhere you been? Is it planet Mars?\nFar beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?\nYou're unfamiliar, but still I feel ya\nEnergy is sending me toward the ceiling\nI'm high now, are you up there?\nIf you was, I would climb every other stair\nI gotta stare, I mean wow\nand I'm wowed, no one compares\nA one-on-one, you must have won\nevery pageant in America when you was young\nLips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy\nBody frame crazy, insane, crazy\nThe only girl that can make time, then make me stop\n\n\nUh, so now we on, so now we gone\nLiving in the city of the unknown\nI show her off, I stunt with her\nWe do it sweet, they look bitter\nLook at her get up, I hear 'em say\nBut why him? I hear 'em hate\nI laugh at it, rather than jab at it\nThen continue eternal life as a crack addict\ncause I'm addicted, and you the drug\nCold turkey? No sir\nGotta be an odyssey from Heaven way above\nYou definite, not probably, I gotta give it up\nLips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy\nBody frame crazy, insane, crazy\nThe only girl that can make time, then make me stop\n\n\nYou something different\nI'm glad I found you\nSo pretty\nI'll never do anything to hurt you\n",
