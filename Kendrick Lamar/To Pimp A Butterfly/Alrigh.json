We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nHuh? We gon' be alright\nNigga, we gon' be alright\nDo you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright\nUh, and when I wake up\nI recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut\nBehind my side we lookin' at you from the face down\nWhat mac-11 even boom with the bass down\nSchemin'! And let me tell you bout my life\nPainkillers only put me in the twilight\nWhere pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight\nNow tell my mama I love her but this what I like\nLord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy\nTell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow\nSo my karma coming heavy\nNo preliminary hearings on my record\nI'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record\nTell the world I know it's too late\nBoys and girls I think I've gone cray\nDrown inside my vices all day\nWon't you please believe when I say\n\nWhen you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga\nWhen our pride was low, lookin' at the world like, \"where do we go, nigga?\"\nAnd we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga\nI'm at the preacher's door\nMy knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright\n\nWhat you want, you a house you a car\n40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar\nAnything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog\nMotherfucker you can live at the mall\nI can see the evil, I can tell it I know it's illegal\nI don't think about it, I deposit every other zero\nThinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal\nDiggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you\nEveryday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you\nIn the presence of your chico... ah!\nI don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool\nIf I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you\nPet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all\nPick back and chat I shut the back for y'all\nI rap, I'm black, on track so rest assured\nMy rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God\n\n\nI keep my head up high\nI cross my heart and hope to die\nLovin' me is complicated\nToo afraid, a lot of changes\nI'm alright and you're a favorite\nDark nights in my prayers\nI remembered you was conflicted\nMisusing your influence, sometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screamin' in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went runnin' for answers\n",
