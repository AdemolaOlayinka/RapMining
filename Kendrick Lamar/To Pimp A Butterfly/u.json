Disculpe!\nAnd you the reason why mama and them leavin'\nNo you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it\nI know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it\nYour trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it\nEveryone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out\nYou was deserted, where was your antennas again?\nWhere was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?\nYou ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend\nA friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend\nLittle brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him\nWhere was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches\nYou faced time the one time, that's unforgiven\nYou even faced time instead of a hospital visit\nYou should thought he would recover, well\nThe surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real\nThen he died, God himself will say \"you fuckin' failed\"\nYou ain't try\nI know your secrets nigga\nMood swings is frequent nigga\nI know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga\nI know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga\nY'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga\nAnd if this bottle could talk I cry myself to sleep\nBitch everything is your fault\nFaults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend\nBecause you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed\nI know your secrets\nDon't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'\nAnd that time you I'm bout to hurl\nI'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you\nYou just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof\nShoulda killed yo ass a long time ago\nYou shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago\nAnd if those mirrors could talk it would say \"you gotta go\"\nAnd if I told your secrets\nThe world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness\n",
