Love and die\nColor of your skin, color of your eyes\nThat\u2019s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay\u2019s baby\nYou blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey\nAll my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave\n12 years of age, thinkin\u2019 my shade too dark\nI love myself, I no longer need Cupid\nAnd forcin\u2019 my dark side like a young George Lucas\nLight don\u2019t mean you smart, bein\u2019 dark don\u2019t make you stupid\nAnd frame of mind for them bustas, ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 \u201cWoohah!\u201d\nNeed a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored\nLike two ties, L-L, you lose two times\nIf you don\u2019t see you beautiful in your complexion\nIt ain\u2019t complex to put it in context\nFind the air beneath the kite, that\u2019s the context\nYeah, baby, I\u2019m conscious, ain\u2019t no contest\nIf you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed\nAin\u2019t no stress, jigga boos wanna be\nI ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 Jay, I ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 Bey\nI\u2019m talkin\u2019 days we got school watchin\u2019 movie screens\nAnd spike yourself esteem\nThe new James Bond gon\u2019 be black as me\nBlack as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea\nAnd it\u2019s all beautiful to me\nCall your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens\nWe all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain\u2019t a thing\nBarefoot babies with no cares\nTeenage gun toters that don\u2019t play fair, should I get out the car?\nI don\u2019t see Compton, I see something much worse\nThe land of the landmines, the hell that\u2019s on earth\n",
