    "lyrics": "Complexion (two-step)\nComplexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)\nComplexion (two-step)\nIt all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)\nDark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun\nGive a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done\nSneak (dissin\u2019)\nSneak me through the back window, I\u2019m a good field nigga\nI made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you\nYou know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down\nEven if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention\n\nDark as the midnight hour, I'm bright as the mornin' Sun\nBrown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run\nSneak (dissin')\nSneak me through the back window, I\u2019m a good field nigga\nI made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you\nYou know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down\nEven if master's listenin', I got the world's attention\nSo I'mma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival\nOf mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival\nBeauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken\nBy different shades of faces\nThen wit told me, \"You're womanless, woman love the creation\"\nIt all came from God then you was my confirmation\nI came to where you reside\nAnd looked around to see more sights for sore eyes\nLet the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...\n\nYou like it, I love it\nYou like it, I love it\n\nLet me talk my Stu Scott, \u2018scuse me on my 2pac\nKeep your head up, when did you stop? Love and die\nColor of your skin, color of your eyes\nThat\u2019s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay\u2019s baby\nYou blew me away, you think more beauty in blue green and grey\nAll my Solomon up north, 12 years a slave\n12 years of age, thinkin\u2019 my shade too dark\nI love myself, I no longer need Cupid\nAnd forcin\u2019 my dark side like a young George Lucas\nLight don\u2019t mean you smart, bein\u2019 dark don\u2019t make you stupid\nAnd frame of mind for them bustas, ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 \u201cWoohah!\u201d\nNeed a paradox for the pair of dots they tutored\nLike two ties, L-L, you lose two times\nIf you don\u2019t see you beautiful in your complexion\nIt ain\u2019t complex to put it in context\nFind the air beneath the kite, that\u2019s the context\nYeah, baby, I\u2019m conscious, ain\u2019t no contest\nIf you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed\nAin\u2019t no stress, jigga boos wanna be\nI ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 Jay, I ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 Bey\nI\u2019m talkin\u2019 days we got school watchin\u2019 movie screens\nAnd spike yourself esteem\nThe new James Bond gon\u2019 be black as me\nBlack as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea\nAnd it\u2019s all beautiful to me\nCall your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens\nWe all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain\u2019t a thing\nBarefoot babies with no cares\nTeenage gun toters that don\u2019t play fair, should I get out the car?\nI don\u2019t see Compton, I see something much worse\nThe land of the landmines, the hell that\u2019s on earth\n",
