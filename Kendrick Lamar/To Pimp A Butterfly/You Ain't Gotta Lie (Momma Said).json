Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang\nWith the homies but your level of realness ain't the same\nCircus acts only attract those that entertain\nSmall talk, we know that it's all talk\nWe live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name\n\nAskin', \"where the hoes at?\" to impress me\nAskin', \"where the moneybags?\" to impress me\nSay you got to burn your stash to impress me\nIt's all in your head, homie\nAskin' \"where the plug at?\" to impress me\nAskin' \"where the juug at?\" to impress me\nAskin' \"where it's at?\" only upsets me\nYou sound like the feds, homie\n\nYou ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga\nYou ain't gotta lie, you ain't gotta lie\nYou ain't gotta lie to kick it, my nigga\nYou ain't gotta try so hard\nAnd the world don't respect you and the culture don't accept you\nBut you think it's all love\nAnd the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done\nReputation can't protect you if you never had one\nJealousy (complex), emotional (complex)\nSelf-pity (complex), under oath (complex)\nThe loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex\nLet me put it back in proper context\n\n\nWhat do you got to offer?\nTell me before you we off ya, put you deep in the coffin\nBeen allergic to talkin', been aversion to bullshit\nInstead of dreamin' the auction, tell me just who your boss is\nNiggas be fugazie, bitches be fugazie\nThis is for fugazie niggas and bitches who make habitual line babies, bless them little hearts\nYou can never persuade me\nYou can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them\nOr you, the truth you love to bend\nIn the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho\nOn the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though\nSo loud, rich niggas got low money\nAnd loud, broke niggas got no money\nThe irony behind it is so funny\nAnd I seen it all this past year\nPass on some advice we feel:\n",
