My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules\nAll the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through\nLot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from\nGrimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son\nFrom the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands\nGucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces\nCritics and fans, they need to get a life\nYou doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now\nI grew with you so you know you make me proud\nAnd most of all you gotta live now\n\n\nLive now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you\nWe'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you\nAll you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending\nNot under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo\nGotta live it up to the limit yo\ncause I promise you you'll regret it bro\n\n\nSon, come close, lemme talk to you\nI got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it\nLook out for little me, one\n",
