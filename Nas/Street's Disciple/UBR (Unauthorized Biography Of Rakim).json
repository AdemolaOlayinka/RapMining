Acknowledgements: First off, I wanna\nthank God. And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out\nwith this. Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1.\"\n\nJanuary 28, 1968\nBorn into this world as William Griffin The Great\nChapter 1, Winedance Long Island\nScientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with\nEric Barrier from East Sandhurst\nThe melody they created was the first\nBurst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This\n'87 dropped a classic disc\nThe facts is the tracklist was like four\nThe vocals, the beats -- according to Marly Marl\nRecorded in my hometown Queensbridge\nThat's why it's so relative\nThis biography was unauthorized\nI spit it how it was given to author Nas\nWilliam changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah\n'Cause Clarence 13X had New York on lock\nGods on every block, jams in every park\nI remember hearin' Curtis Blow saying\n\"It can't get better than this\"\n'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits\nFrom leather coats to shell toes to the stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks\nFirst million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that\nFrom 41st & Broadway to Uni to MCA\nWe followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre\nSupreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap\nForte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack\nPaid In Full posse, hot they was on\nAnd Ra had his firstborn\nWith the next line I'ma be easy\nHis wisdom's name is Fifi\nEPMD put a record out, was dope\nTension spread, and I quote \"Smack me and I smack you back\"\nSounded like the answer to the I Ain't No Joke track\nFor a second it ain't look good\nLittle tension buzzin' from Winedance to Brentwood\nMisunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddy Foxx\nTotin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was\nHow was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways\nLet The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP\nA sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son\nA few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom\nAt sixteen, son was watchin' him, mesmorized\nRespect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides\nHe came on the stage with lasers in his eyes\nWalk with me now\n\n\"Unauthorized biography of Rakim. Epilogue: Mother was\na jazz singer. Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown\nDiscography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let\nThe Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's\nthe end of the group. Went off to solo. Dropped the\nR, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', The\nMaster. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release\nan album Oh My God with Dr. Dre. The album was\ndismantled because of creative differences. Thee end\nto the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS1. Peace.\"\n",
