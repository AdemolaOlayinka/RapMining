T.W.I\"\n\"Ha, well here I am\"\n\"Yep, I'm the man\"\n\"Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand\"\nSo here we standin' before I begin\nHomegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem\nTongue skills, yea I like that\nNow we on the right track\nStraight to my Phantom called \"Africa Black\"\nEver since then, she been yappin' her track\nTold her friends now they hollerin' behind her back\nSing\n\nBaby girl won't you come and hold my hand\nWon't you come and chill out with the Virgo\nHey girl, just come and hold my hand\nWon't you come and just chill with the Virgo\nWe sippin' on Merlot\nYou ain't got be my girl though\nI'll drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle\nSmash with the Virgo\nAin't got to take your shirt off\nBut see me convince your homegirl though\n\nNow I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds\nWhen I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining, \"bling!\"\nA little cute thing said, \"What's your name?\"\nI put my necklace in her face and told her \"Read the chain\"\nOoh, ooh so stuck up\nTold me \"Shut the fuck up\"\nBlow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house\nThe needle hit the record, they was playing this song\nAll the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on\nLive forever like 'Fame', let the Leroys dance\nWhile I'm laid back chilling in my b-boy stance\nCould be a little pop locking if your girl's tops droppin\nBut watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options\nBut later for that ASDAQ throw 'em on the fast track\nMake 'em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that\nHoney in the black cause I'm feeling her curves\nShe looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word\nWhy only serve one when you can serve up two\nThen at the bachelor's pad doing what the Virgos do\nAnd these women so shy, but get loud undercover\nSo we can have sex, but I can't be your lover!\nSing\n\nBaby girl won't you come and hold my hand\nWon't you come and just chill with the Virgo\nHey girl, just come and hold my hand\nWon't you come and chill out with the Virgo\nWe sippin' on Merlot\nYou ain't got be my girl though\nI'll drop you off at Peachtree and Merlot\nSmash with the Virgo\nAin't got to take your shirt off\nBut see me convince your homegirl though\n",
