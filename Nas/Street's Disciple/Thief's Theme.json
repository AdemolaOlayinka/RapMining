Just another day in the hood\nAnd I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good\nWe saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em\nBut our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em\nMoney dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes\nRun they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin\nAnd I had to make a song, speakin on my old life\nFor the thief's who come out at night\n\n\nOne, two\nCheck, one, two\nOne, two\nCheck, one, two\nOne, two, who got more style, the son do\n",
