I don't know\n\n\n\nImagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassing\nImagine going to court with no trial\nLifestyle cruising blue behind my waters\nNo welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters\nDays are shorter, nights are colder\nFeeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra\nThe world's hot my son got knocked evidentaly\nIt's elementary, they want us all gone eventually\nTrooping out of state for a plate knowledge\nof coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars\nImagine everybody flashing, fashion\nDesigner clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues\nYour people holding dough, no parole\nNo rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers\nJust some thoughts for the mind\nI take a glimpse into time\nwatch the blimp read \"The World Is Mine\"\n\n\n\nIf I ruled the world\nImagine that\nI'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls\nCould it be, if you could\nbe mine, we'd both shine\nIf I ruled the world\nStill living for today, in\nthese last days and times\n\n\n\nThe way to be, paradise like relaxing black, latino and anglo-saxon\nArmani exchange the reins\nCash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last\nBrand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path\nThe Villa house is for the crew, how we do\nTrees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches\nSo many years of depression make me vision\nThe better living, type of place to raise kids in\nOpen they eyes to the lies history's told foul\nBut I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child\nSeeing things like I was controlling, click rolling\nTricking six digits on kicks and still holding\nTrips to Paris, I civilized every savage\nGimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish\nPolitical prisoner set free, stress free\nNo work release purple M3's and jet skis\nFeel the wind breeze in West Indies\nI make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies\nIt sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown\nI'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa\n\n\n\nIf I ruled the world\nImagine that\nI'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls\nCould it be, if you could\nbe mine, we'd both shine\nIf I ruled the world\nStill living for today, in\nthese last days and times\n\nAnd then we'll walk right up to the sun\nHand in hand\nWe'll walk right up to the sun\nWe won't land\nWe'll walk right up to the sun\nHand in hand\nWe'll walk right up to the sun\nWe won't land\n\n\n\nYou'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry\nDuck down in car seats, heat's mandatory\nRunning from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes\nThese are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state\nWait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight\nTrying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe\nMillionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera\nMaking moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler\nCause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich\nStill nobody want a nigga having shit\nIf I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit\nI push a Q-45 Infinit\nIt wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies\nStrictly living longevity to the destiny\nI thought I'd never see but reality struck\nBetter find out before your time's out, what the fuck??\n\n\n\nIf I ruled the world\nImagine that\nI'd free all my sons, I love em em baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls\nCould it be, if you could\nbe mine, we'd both shine\nIf I ruled the world\nStill living for today, in\nthese last days and times\n\nIf I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled\nImagine that\nI'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled\nI love em love em baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls, black diamonds\nCould it be, if you could\nblack diamonds\nbe mine, we'd both shine\nIf I ruled the world\nStill living for today, in\nthese last days and times\n\nIf I ruled the world, if I ruled\nif I ruled, I'd free all my sons\nblack diamonds, I love em love em baby\nBlack diamonds and pearls, if I ruled\nIf I ruled the world\n\nIf I ruled the world\nI love em love em baby!!\n",
