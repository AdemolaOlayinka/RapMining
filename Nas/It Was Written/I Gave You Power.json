Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga\nJust use me for whatever the fuck they want\nI don't get to say shit\nJust grab me, just do what the fuck they want\nSell me, throw me away\nNiggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?\nLike I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit\nIt's like I'm a motherfuckin gun\nI can't believe this shit....\nWord up.. (word up..)\n\nI seen some cold nights and bloody days\nThey grab and me bullets spray\nThey use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day\nMy body is cold steel for real\nI was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed\nUnder car seats they sneak me in clubs\nBeen in the hands of mad thugs\nThey feed me when they load me with mad slugs\nSeventeen precisely, one in my head\nThey call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead\nI'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns\nOhio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly\nBeat up and battered, they pull me out\nI watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill\nBut what I feel it never mattered\nWhen I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired\nA broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves\nunder beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred\nKeep me full up with hollow heads\n\n\n\nHow you like me now? I go blaow\nIt's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul\nI might have took your first child\nScarred your life, crippled your style\nI gave you power\nI made you buck wild\n\n\nAlways I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip\nThe barrel is my dick, uncircumcised\nPull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me\nResults of what happens to niggaz shock me\nI see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears\nfall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years\nI've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me\nPlacin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed\nI was laid in a shelf, with a grenade\nMet a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say\nFive-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero\nHad a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place\nwhere he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him\nTired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun\nBut yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on\nI make myself jam right in my owner's hand\n\n\n\n\nYo, weeks went by and I'm surprised\nStill stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides\nBesides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine\nThere's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin\nCause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear\nHe's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career\nYo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf\nHis eyes bubblin, he said, \"It was on\"\nI felt his palm troubled him shakin\nSomebody stomped him out, his dome was achin\nHe placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin\nMy creation was for blacks to kill blacks\nIt's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories\nBut this time, it's done intentionally\nHe walked me outside, saw this cat\nCocked me back, said, \"Remember me?\"\nHe pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong\nKnowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im\nHe squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood\nSick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge\nWhat the other kid did was pull out, no doubt\nA newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase\nMy owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast\nI didn't know he was hit, it's over with\nHeard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin\nNow I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me\nDamn!\n",
