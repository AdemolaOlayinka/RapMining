Word where the real niggaz at?\n\n\nListen.. to reason\nPretty baby baby listen..\n\n\nA young wild beautiful love child\nYou like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin\nHit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin\nThe head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine\nReminiscent of my first time up in a chick\nYou was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit\nChanel lookin real, airbrushed nails\nHit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)\nTo see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me\nThe way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me\nWishin I could be the one man; but you juggle\nway too many Willies all in one hand\nYou wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on\nNiggaz pull your hair, shake your fat rear\nGet your fuck on - followin week, you back there\nBut what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars\nPuffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out\nCould you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas\nNiggaz thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave\nWhat up mah, frontin like you naive\nPusherman's whip, callin police when you flip\nCan't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us\nBut for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!\n\n\n\nDiamonds all shinin, lookin all fine\nPretty little face, get a little high\nYoung girl stugglin, tryin to survive\nMother of the Earth, she made you and I\nJust tired of playin the same ol' games\nMessin with my mind, emotional thangs\nAnd there goes.. a black girl.. lost\n\n\nLike Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless\nGrow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest\nto who'sever gettin down and trifless\nTo get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless\nCause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs\nMore than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)\nThere you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours\nSeem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours\nFace glistenin, I'm addicted to you\nOriginal, Wisdom Body got me picturin you\nIgloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen\nto this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets\nMust've had a bad deal in the past though\nCan't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow\nSay men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain\nYou got a job part-time and school's your night thing\nWith dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now\nYou gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed\nTypical day that the black girl sees\nComin home wantin more from a college degree\n\n\n\n\nWhere are you focused, on legit niggaz and where the coke is\nNice and Thug Life niggaz, yo you seem hopeless\nYour value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you\ncould ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to\nmore than the world, but not knowin nothin about you\nYou leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to\ndrop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off\nSo hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)\nGrowin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to\nEverything that move be inside you\nSacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you\nI watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to\nThey spot you out dancin topless in your drawers\nDamn look, there goes a black girl lost\n\n\nYou should be ashamed of yourself\nThe way you carry yourself\nThe way you hang out all night long\nDoin silly things that is wrong\nBlack girl..\n",
