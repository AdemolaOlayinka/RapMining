    "lyrics": "P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate\nWe was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late\nSo I decided now I'm in charge\nEither stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter\nBefore Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars\nTrying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard\nRoll with a shooting squad\nHow could I not succumb? How could I not partake?\n15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train\nLicked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?\nA hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king\nBut I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of\nDudes who switch up and change\nThey want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame\nI never let them know, I just forgive them though\nEither that or the pistol blow\n\nI remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah\nWalking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah\nWorth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums\nBrazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties\nI'm pushing 40, she only 21\nDon't applaud me, I'm exhausted G\nMe and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup\nY'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut\nRemember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck\nSaid stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani\nHood forever, I just act like I'm civilized\nReally what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers\nTo take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs\nAnd teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back\n\n1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him\nGone a few years, the whole world snoring on him\nGirls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them\nShe says, \"third leg from a legend is sheer heaven\"\nShe says, \"it is the greatest loving\"\nThe tales you hear is the truth, on me\nWho wasn't the most faithful husband\nReveal my life, you will forgive me\nYou will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me\nOnly a few will, this how it sounds when you too real\nThey think it's just music still\nWell I am a graphic classic song composer\nMusic notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure\nSome of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love\nAlso goes to y'all, let's see\nThe craziest things already happened to me\nSo either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha\n",
