    "lyrics": "Just like a rose\nEverybody knows that you are so beautiful\nBut I feel a thorn in my hide\nI should've known, we can't repair what we broke\nBut I held you close\nToo close\nI should've left your roses at the door\nThey're sharper than before\nAnd I don't want them no more\nI should've left your roses at the door\nThey're sharper than before\nAnd I don't need them no more\n\nI have no time to give you guidance\nBarely have any fuck time either\nHefner minded like, I think you're fine, but\nI seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver\nMind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her\nOr if she insecure, most are\nIf she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off\nNot a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows\nEverything to go to your spouse when you end your vows\nMy tax bracket not enough blacks have it\nWho should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress?\nA white chick, they might flip talking that blackness\nShould only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet\nIf you mad at that, you'll be mad forever\nNever played you, I prayed we would stay together\nWished it'd last forever, know what I mean\nHeard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams\n\nJust like a rose\nEverybody knows that you are so beautiful\nBut I feel a thorn in my hide\nI should've known, we can't repair what we broke\nBut I held you close\nToo close\n\nThem Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions\nThey some silent killers, that stress shit\nThat put ulcers in a lot of niggas\nI'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper\nI done went to hell and back, you always think you right\nYou know when you wrong, and still you want to fight\nWhen people like my song, you want to kill 'em right?\nYou resent me every time I make a million right?\nYou want to experience life when you calling all the shots\nOrdering bottles for all your girls up in the spot\nHave your own cash, own your own Benz\nYour own house, everything, me, I understand\nThought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee\nPut you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street\nThe first movie he made, thought that was fly\nI thought you was flyer, you a fuckin' liar\n\nJust like a rose\nEverybody knows that you are so beautiful\nBut I feel a thorn in my hide\nI should've known, we can't repair what we broke\nBut I held you close\nToo close\nI should've left your roses at the door\nThey're sharper than before\nAnd I don't want them no more\nI should've left your roses at the door\nThey're sharper than before\nAnd I don't need them no more\n",
