Guess we'll know in due time\nEverybody has rights, can I use mine?\nCan I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?\nGot a swell life, tell me will I lose mine?\nEvery time I turn around somebody new dying\nLet's start living, alecart, Escargo, Escobar invest my millions\nMansion for the wife the rest for the children\nKnowing that they coming anytime\nBut until then I'm gonna in lost till they shoot me\nMillion dollar stones in my camouflaged Gucci\nGiving you this crack like Pookie\nTo question the system, be the resistance\nNo matter what color you are everybody niggas\nOr you can stand by or watch or you can march on with us\n\n\nSome revolutionaries get old although I'm told\nYou'll get a left full of bullet holes when you tell the people go free\nOh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me\n",
