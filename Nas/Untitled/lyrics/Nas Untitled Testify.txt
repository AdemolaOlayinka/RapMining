I want to dedicate this song right here
To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers

I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm
Eighty years
Come home nigga
Come home, niggers

Ugh


I just burnt my American flag
and sent three cracker nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my mag
to send these redneck biggots to some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?


 (Testifyyyyy for me)
Huh? Would you Testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs 
but will you ride with me?
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim right?
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
Then get your aim right
And get your game tight


Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing hoe'ing shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' hoe bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it (heh)
like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)
like uhh, William Cooper 
who told you the (Pale Horse) is the future


 (Testifyyyyy for me)
Would you testify on some realness like that?
I think you scared (heh)
I don't think you prepared
Yeah
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
You know what I'm asking you?
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
Do you know what I'm asking you? 
Wow...
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
Wow...
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
 (Testifyyyyy for me)
