Lace the nations don't have it 
A hatred addict 
I need faces mad with frowns 
When I'm around 
Or I'm wasting the fabric 
I don't feel greater 
To my plush pieces 
'Cause you to suck your teeth 
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging 
Mean nothing 
Women dream I'm your husband 
I'm Alex Pushkin 
The black poetry-writing Russian 
Ice disgusting 
I started bling 
How could you question my direction 
Or my time for collection 
Gangstas two-steppin' 
You hate me 
Should thank me 
But lately I burned so much trees 
I keep environmentalists angry 
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder 
Your best success is my worst blunder 
Y'all living trendy on pennies 
I cop plenty Fendi 
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good 
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood 
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy 
NY to Miami 'Cause . . . 
(We make the world go round) 
Now let's toast to the hustlers 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers 
(We make the world go round) 
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. 
(We make the world go round) 
I see THE haters on the floor jockin my swag 
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags 
I'm pouring champagne inside a polo glass 
Model b'tches rollin grass 
Escabon folding cash 
toasting wit my entourage 
went for Robin Armitage to all my stars 
red carpet to the Larmitage 
We throwin red dice at the Mirage 
I pull that red Lamborghini 
or twenties out my garage 
instead of shopping South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad 
We the Best! big pippin 
Top down chrome spinnin 
Top Gun Tom Cruise 
Tucked inside my Gucci linen 
No Jess Romo you tryin' a shine
up on with the nine 
on your jersey for promo 
Jessica Simpson that's so-so 
Nick want his baby back but thats lo so. 
Devil white 
5-0 they catch me at the pro bowl on the field diamonds 
choking the jockey on my polo 
CB let em know though 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers 
(We make the world go round) 
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. 
(We make the world go round) 
We make the world go round From my town to your town 
We on top no stopping us now 
We got patron to ballers two steppin 
Ladies on the float and all in two steppin 
From Malay to Harlem two stepping 
So I' stop cause we made it where the ladies are 
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots 
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart 
A-life tag popper 
It'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags 
Worth a 100 cash, shopping 
Balance only would hafta 
Hafta to swell you up 
before a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch 
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet 
Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black 
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss 
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche 
Top down, new fashion 
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera 
Light flashing, and I'm laughin' 
My plaque's from album sales 
Y'all is ringtone platinum 
But .99 cents adds up 
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em 
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what! 
Now let's toast to the hustlers 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas. 
(We make the world go round) 
Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers 
(We make the world go round) 
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us. 
(We make the world go round)
