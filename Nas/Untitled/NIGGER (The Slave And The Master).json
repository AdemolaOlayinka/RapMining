You the question and the answer\n\n\nWe trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us\nPowdered eggs and government cheeses\nThe calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus\nGotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers\nSchools with outdated books, we are the forgotten\nSummers, coolin off by the fire hydrant\nYeah I'm from the ghetto\nWhere old black women talk about their sugar level - it's not unusual\nTo see photos of dead homie's funerals\nAluminium foil on TV antennas\nLittle TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners\nGirls die their hair with Kool-Aid\nThey gave us lemons, we made lemonade\nBut this nigger's payed, ancestral slaves\nDescendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling\nPut rims on everything, where tims on every scene\n\n\n\n\nDo I mean it like a slave master, nigger?\nNo I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers\nMy abbreviation was young when I caught the cases\nThat should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets\nSavers went broke, smokes, our diesel, need no Bowflex\nMy chest still cut up like a bag of dope\nBought patterns consist of boss matters\nSpit Moses' lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth\nToast to government cameras peepin us, every week I must\nHave my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs\nBut this is what I was dreamin of\nBetween cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up\nThey used to string us up, we wanted everything\nBut the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the\nLike the New Jack City wedding scene\nNo time for mistake, tryna get it like metering\n\n\n\n\n{My nig', what up my nig'? Yep!}\nPeople afraid of criticism\nBut I always put myself in a sacrificial position\nThey been know I ain't just rappin for fame\nI got my old homie hasslin to father askin for chains\nYep, I get it cash up, this paper don't matter\nThey see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war\nThey got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more\nSo now my enemies are at my front door\nCause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence\nThey callin it reverse racism\nStill to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'\nI'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me\nYou'll always know where to find me\nThey say the close ones will hurt you\nSo let's keep a small circle\nOn the road to riches and diamond rings\nIn the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king\n",
