Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart\nA-life tag popper\nIt'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags\nWorth a 100 cash, shopping\nBalance only would hafta\nHafta to swell you up\nbefore a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch\nMets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet\nBet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black\nPaid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss\nWeekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche\nTop down, new fashion\nSeeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera\nLight flashing, and I'm laughin'\nMy plaque's from album sales\nY'all is ringtone platinum\nBut .99 cents adds up\nI don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em\nThe new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what!\nNow let's toast to the hustlers\n(We make the world go round)\nTell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas.\n(We make the world go round)\nTell them gangstas, toast to the ballers\n(We make the world go round)\nAnd tell the ballers pour glass for all us.\n(We make the world go round)\n",
