    "lyrics": "We use the word everyday\nNow we don't know the capacity of this word\nAre we headed for conflict or not? (Yes sir)\nBecause we did not break down the capacity\nOf the same what (The same word)\nBrothers and sisters, this is why we hung up the consciousness\nWe've been taught wrong\n\n\nFind a room to lock yourself in and close the door\nIt's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore\nWe gotta strip the word down rugged and raw\nThe rhetoric of Martin King just ain't around no more\nDu Bois ain't here, James Baldwin neither, they all were leaders\nBut they ain't help me get this Porsche two seater\nA lawyer left the hood, he never looked back\nTo be a Forture 500 CEO and took rap\nSo what if my pants sag with my hat turned back?\nThe same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack\nMarketing companies is hiring blacks\nFresh hip-hop lingo for your campaign ads\nControversy surrounds who could say it and when\nSome niggas are full time, some play and pretend\nSo fuck that, no apologies on the issue\nIf it offends you it's meant to, it's that simple\n\n\nTryin' to erase me from y'all memory\nToo late, I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas!)\nSpeak my name and breathe life in me\nMake sure y'all never forget me ('Cause y'all give me life!)\n'Cause y'all use my name so reckless\nWhether to be accepted or disrespected (And I love it!)\nAnd I love it, especially when y'all do it in public\nAnd I'm the subject\n'Cause y'all my niggas\n\n\nYo, I was thinkin' a little bit\nWhat would it take to authenticate my nigganess?\nBall ridiculous? 26 inches when I call up the dealership?\nAww that's some nigga shit\nWe only out for our own benefit?\nWe havin' too many kids? We Claudines? Welfare recipients?\nThe infamous free clinics is the sickest shit\nMake me think what the hell they clean they syringes with\nEverybody bleeding, the cops are the demons\nCourtrooms full of goons, jail buses leanin'\nHandcuffs squeezed too tight on youth life\nIf you fight they just give in, people used to do sit ins\nThey got Nigeria and Niger, two different countries\nSomehow Niger turned to nigger, and shit got ugly\nThe problem is we started thinking like the colonists\n'Til Noble Drew Ali started droppin' that consciousness\n\n\n\n\nMy father was not a banker, neither was my neighbor\nWhen it came to gettin' paper who the hell was gonna train us?\nOppresion couldn't escape us through the ages\nWe changed the basis of derogatory phrases\nAnd I say it's quite amazing\nThe use of ghetto terms developed out own language\nNo matter where it came from\nIt's celebrated, now people are mad if they ain't one\n\n\nEvery word we use, it has a capacity\nAnd if you don't understand the words you're using\nAnd understand the capacity of it\nYou are using words that is creating a destiny for you\nThat you don't even know, or even conscious of\n",
