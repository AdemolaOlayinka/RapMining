They said...\"\n\n\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president\" - )\n\n\nYes we can...change the world...\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...}\n\n\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president\" - )\nYes we can...change the world...\n(The world, the world, the WORLD...)\n\n\nThey forgot us on the block, got us in the box\nSolitary confinement, how violent are these cops?\nThey need a early retirement\nHow many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march\nI got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought\nPublic housing, projects, cookin up in the Pyrex\nMy set, my clique, either gettin money\nor runnin from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet\nTryna be rich, STILL I'm pledging allegiance\nA predicate felon, a ghetto leader\nLendin my poetical genius, to who-EVER may need it\nI BLEED this from Queensbridge, now living with my feet up\nNever defeated, so a president's needed\nYou know these colored folks and Negros hate to see\none of they own succeeding\nAmerica, surprise us, and let a black man guide us\n\n\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president\" - )\n\n\nYes we can...change the world...\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...}\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the black pres' thinkin on election night?\nIs it, \"How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?\"\nEvery other president was nuttin' less than white\n'cept Thomas Jefferson and mixed Indian blood and Calvin Coolidge\nKKK is like, \"What the fuck?!\", loadin they guns up\nLoadin up mines too, ready to ride\n'Cause I'm ridin with my crew - he dies, we die too\nYeah, but on the positive side\nI think Obama provides hope, and challenges minds\nof all races and colors to erase the hate\nand try to LOVE one another; so many political snakes\nWe in need of a break, I'm thinkin I can TRUST this brotha\n...but will he keep it way real?\nEvery innocent nigga in jail, gets out on appeal\nWhen he wins, will he really care still?\nI feel...\n\n\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president\" - )\n\n\nYes we can...change the world...\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...}\n\n\n\n\nSay a prayer for \"Do we have to?\"\nYou ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor\nin love with a slave master\nSincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper\nJesse carjacker, Uncle TOm kidnapper\nAsk around, Bently Coupe off the Richter\nBitch called Life, I pimped her, WHAT?\nPolitics, politricks, Klan shooter\nDeacon for defense, progress producer\nNothing on the stove, a survival booster\nGotta DO what we gotta DO\nWe ain't got no governors comin through to help!\nAnything we need done, gotta do for self\nNew, improved JFK on the way\nIt ain't the 60s' again, niggas ain't hippies again\nWe ain't fallin for the same traps\nStandin on the balconies, where they shot the King at\nMcCain got apoligies, ain't nobody hearin that\nPeople need HONESTY!\n\n\n(\"Although it seems heaven-sent, we ain't ready, to have a black president\" - )\n\n\nYes we can...change the world...\n{CHANGE THE WORLD...}\n\n\n\n\nIt is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce\nthe next President of the United States - Barack Obama\n",
