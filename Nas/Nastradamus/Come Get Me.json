Now you wanna take me down?\nIf I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt\nYour crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds\nDick rings for your chicklings\nNiggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about\nFuck you say girlie mouth? Get it krunk like the Dirty South\nAnd I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i\nHear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?\nGirls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?\nYou make hot songs, but she know you steal from me\nWho ill as me? I wild on haters in album three\nNext level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D\nCan't find a nigga shook from Queens\nI'll be with the most grimy killers\n(what nigga) and they all look clean\nwho put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start\nYour next stop is to the graveyard\n\n\nYou too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft\nYou talk but you scared to go back up North\nKeep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin\nTalk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop frontin\nYou don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again\nBe on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn\nShoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore\nPut y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor\nSo play tough, I want y'all to get out of line\nI got nines, every color shape and design\nI sent killers every race to put one in your spine\nTwo in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?\nNobody never get involved and none of em dyin\nI think like you do, roll with about two irons\nCatch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin\n- and dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass\nto rich-ass to gauze up, your stab wounds\nWhile I'm gettin head, in a Lear jet, bathroom\nWith all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases\nfull of paper, not money it's bank statements\nThe Illmatic that explains how we rock\nYachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block\n\n\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n\"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus\"\n\"Everybody watch him\"\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n\"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus\"\n\"We-we-we came a long way\"\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n\"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus\"\n\"Everybody watch him\"\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n\"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus\"\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n\"ladies and gentlemen..\"\n{\"Hydro Drops\" weed skit follows}\n",
