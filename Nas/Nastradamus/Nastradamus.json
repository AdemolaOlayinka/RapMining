I could let a slug melt in your hat\nCuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em\nCentury 21 solar eclipse\nWhile you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc\nThelonius, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet\nAK is my heat, everyday in the street till I lay six feet\nQB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps\nJewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto\nFour-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles\nPop bottles with those who left here\nThe best years, wearin a bulletproof vest years\nThe aim for the head and chest years\nWhat's your name? Make your name known\nFor the next year's, better rep, yeah\n\n- Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar\nNow he is Nastrodamus\nNasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar\nNow he is Nastrodamus\n\nNasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar\nNow he is Nastrodamus\nNasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar\nNow he is Nastrodamus\n\nI let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits\nThe Nastrodamus tell us what time it is\nI was the first one on that Don shit\nFirst nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit\nBlack ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips\nRun up in your crib, tie up your bitch\nWeigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell\nSpendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels\nHood rats and bullet wound up females\nGot babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail\nSlingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips\nBase heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit\nA week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills\nOur honies wearin' Gucci high heels\nShe come to scoop me, I chill\nLeave streets alone for a sec\nHit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech\nUh\n\n\n\nNow, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone\nRest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne\nWe gon' rep it the best that we can\nPhysically, you was killed by the weapons of man\nBut where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now\nWhere Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend\nAnd they don't understand how you C.E.O. from heaven\nBut that's another level, brethren\nTow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's\nWe do squeeze, thought it's not right\nBut that's the zone that we left in\nBentleys, Porches, DRJ watches\nSick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless\nLaptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes\nAnd we all roll dice, for each other's ice\nAnd how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?\nBut only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...\n\n\n\nIll Will\nNastrodamus\nNew LP for the 2G\nUh\nBravehearts\nNation\nBig Things\nLucciano\nOh, the Lord again\nM-O-B-B Deep\nZaire\nJungle\nRaise hope\n",
