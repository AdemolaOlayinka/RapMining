It goes......\n\n\nShoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what..\n(whispering)\nKill kill kill, murder murder murder\n\n\nDriving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet\n6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way\nTo get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house\nNot a freak to be heard, nobody came out\nRingin the bell, where in the hell\nCould they be at, I'm about to leave\nSteppin' slow, where my truck was at\nWho the fuck is that?\nCould it be a jack?\nNow pull my strap, it's my man\nAnd we have the same plan\nThere them bitches go\nCivic '94, looking funny though\nOpen up the car door, funny smile\nFuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy\n\"Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man. Ready?\"\nWalked in the house, snatched off they clothes\nRan through them hoes\nPlenty ice, that they all seemed to like\nCan't find my man, heard a blam blam\nNow I'm wonderin, \"In this scam, do I even stand a chance?\"\nHe killed the hoes, took all they doe\nFire in his eyes, higher than the sky\nComin down the stairs\nNow he wantin mine, reachin for my nine\nAiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time\nmy nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering\n\"Put your gun down, we can skip town\"\nRocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat\nLift off his chain\nTook his shit, emptied out close range...\n",
