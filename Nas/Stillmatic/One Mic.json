I feel it in my gut\nTHAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN\nCAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!\n\n\nAll I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need\nAll I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world\nAll I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know\nAll I need is one mic..\n\n\nALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN\nWHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND\nOr wanna see me on top, too egotistical\nTalkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do\nWonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you\nonly if they know, what your weakness is I have none\nToo late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga\nThought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggaz\nWhat you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin\nWar gets deep, some beef is everlastin\nComplete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other\nup in prison yards, drama, where does it start?\nYou know the block was ill as a youngster\nEvery night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster\nFor real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name\nJealous cause fiends got they work and complain\nBitches left me cause they thought I was finished\nShoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence\nDiamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes\nMovin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight\nSwellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real\nHeard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?\nThis is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found\nYou need some soul searchin, the time is now\n\nAll I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah\nAll I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash\nAll I need is one mic.. fuck the cars, the jewelry\nAll I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world\n",
