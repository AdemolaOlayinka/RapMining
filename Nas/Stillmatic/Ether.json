Pac, Nas and Big\nAin't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy\nI embrace y'all with napalm\nBlows up, no guts, left chest, face gone\nHow could Nas be garbage?\nSemi-autos at your cartilage\nBurner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne\nI got this, locked since '9-1\nI am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced\nGave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas\nWith Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music\nCheck it\n\n\n\n\nAy yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)\nAy, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the fucking ring\n\n\n\nI've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten\nLuck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten\nY'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)\nTalk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face\nY'all some \"well wishers,\" friendly acting, envy hiding snakes\nWith your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?\nWhen these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep\nThat this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef\nStarted cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo\nTo explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle\nThis for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid\nWhen KRS already made an album called Blueprint\nFirst, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big\nDick sucking lips, why not you let the late, great veteran live\n\n\n(I...will...not...lose)\n\"God's son\" across the belly, I prove you lost already\nThe king is back, where my crown at?\n(Ill...will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas\n\n\n\nY'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches\nWhat's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother\nYou traded your soul for riches\nMy child, I've watched you grow up to be famous\nAnd now I smile like a proud dad, watching his only son that made it\nYou seem to be only concerned with dissing women\nWere you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?\nWell life is hard, hug me, don't reject me\nOr make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly\nIn '88 you was getting chased through your building\nCalling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers\nAll I did was gave you a style for you to run with\nSmiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god\nWearing Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars\nNo jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case\nJust Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase\nYou a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan\nI still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class\nYou Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?\nAsk me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge\nNah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though\nThat ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow\nIs he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?\nOh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy\nRockefeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter\nAnd that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?\nPut it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas\nAnd now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?\nPhilly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas\nIn a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas\nFoxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss\nWhat you think, you getting girls now 'cause of your looks?\nNe-gro please\nYou no mustache having, with whiskers like a rat\nCompared to Beans you wack\nAnd your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame\nYou ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Caine, to Herb, to Big\nAnd, Eminem murdered you on your own shit\nYou a dick-riding faggot, you love the attention\nQueens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons\nHa, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick\nJ.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick\nYour whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick\nShawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick\nSo little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick\nHow much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips?\nWanted to be on every last one of my classics\nYou pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss\n",
