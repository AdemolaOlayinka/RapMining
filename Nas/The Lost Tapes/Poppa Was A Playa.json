    "lyrics": "To My Nigga who brought me in this world\nTaught us right Nigga\n\nMy old dad imported to the family structure\nProvide her God\nMy moms a queen at university civaliza\nMy pops maybe was late but always came home\nMy moms would put us to bed and she would wait on\nSoon as he walk in the door she barking\nI turned out the Jonny Carson\nJumped out the bed\nWe grabbed both his legs\nMe and my brother\nNot knowing the pain he gave my mother\nNight after night, fighting yelling at each other\nMy papa played the street all day\nMama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way\nShe sacrifices all she got to feed us\nWhen she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding\nBut still I didn't see it\nMama hid it from us\nWe was kids younger\nTill we got bigger, on to\nBigger things that we knew what the time was\nThat daddy was leaving the crib and moms love\n\nPapa was player, player wasn't papa\nPapa loved the ladies\nNever got enough of\nPretty brown round\nRunning round town (Shhhhh)\nDon't tell your mother what's going down\n\n\nSo many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was\nThat's why I show my pop love\nHe was still around when I fucked up\nHe could have left\nMy moms pregnant shock to death but stayed\nWatch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade\nTo my first fist fight\nRight behind me he would stand\nNo matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man\nThrow dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam\nHe watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam\nRoaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing\nNext thing you know he packing\nSo then I asked him\nWhat's this white shit on that plate and your facing?\nPapa why you butt ass from the waist\nAnd who's this lady I'm facing\nDark skin you're not my mommy\nHe grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me\nPromise things that he would buy me\nIf I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy\nHe said one day I'll understand little me\nWas in you to side me\n\nPapa was player, player wasn't papa\nPapa loved the ladies\nNever got enough of\nPretty brown round\nRunning round town (Shhhhh)\nDon't tell your mother what's going down\n\n\nPop's told me hold my own\nPop's told me value home\nCould I help it papa was a rolling stone\nWho loved the pretty brown round\nOut of town bound\nJumping in his jazz Benz he touring\nAt home I play his latest recordings\nAnd it's strange now how, I do my thing now\nI'm in the game now\nAnd heard of it his brain pow\nTo pull strings and gain power\nFrom weed habits are same now\nNo white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes\nAnd beats that be pumping\nBefore he left he taught me something\nA child's young years the most important time to be there\nThat's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here\nI'm older now see what having a father's about\nOne day they can be in your life next day they be out\nIt's not because of you, you know the deal\nHim and your moms feel\nIf they stay together then someone will get killed\nI love you still\nAlways will\nCause that's my nigga\nAlthough you felt you was wrong\nI still feel you kid\nLife gose on\n",
