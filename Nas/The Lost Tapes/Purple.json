Fuck it, it's just an intro\nHate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it\nWriting, across the stomach spell GOD son\nLife is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan\nMatter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine\nMost of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities\nHalf of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots\nMay the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin the block\nWhere they used to stand at, somebody's takin they place\nA younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that\nSame walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible\nA thug dies, another step inside his shoes\nAnd they will hurt you, layin low with a bottle\nI'm blowin circles, my state of mind purple\n\nLight it, light it, uhh\nYeah.. light it up, light it up, uhh\n\nY'all just wanna deal with drama\nTalk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma\nEverything you went to is underworld related\nYou sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred\nYou don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers\nto pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder\nThink of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you\nEverybody's under six feet of ground but you\nStill standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real\nYou a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill\nYou got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready\nTrustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly\nThe hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day\nA bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away\nThat ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes\nwhose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?\nUnmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God\nSomebody tell these shorties reach for the stars\nInstead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror\nLookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya\nWe smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny\nHe sighs with eyes that seen a war too many\nCold-blooded murderers, universal\nHood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple\n\nLight it up, light it up light it up, uhh\nLight it up.. light it up, light it up, uhh\nUhh.. uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh\n\nThese hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble\nReactin before thinkin, they easily irritated\nAnd murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin\nwhen we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail\nDrug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin\ninstead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?\nPeople shoutin, police pushin the crowd\nAnd on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him\nAm I hallucinatin off the hazin?\nOr did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in\nIt's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots\nPhotograph pictures of, suspect faces\nIt's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent\nBut if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch\nA divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair\nI dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair\nThis Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy\n(?) Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me\nThis is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you\nSo, my state of mind's all purple\n",
