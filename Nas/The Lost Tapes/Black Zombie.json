    "lyrics": "Uhh\n\n\nYo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?\nAll we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?\nAnd you believe when they be tellin you lie, all on the media?\nThey make the world look crazy to keep you inside?\nWhy you listen when the teachers at school\nknow you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool\nGive your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes\nKillin shorty future, I wonder how do we last it\nUnderground in they casket? Ancestors turnin\nI'm learnin somethin every day, there is no Lazareth\nWords like God is Greek or Latin\nSo if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters\nMy niggaz is chillin, gettin high, relaxin\nEnvisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen\nWhat do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes\nNot enough banks, to give a brother a loan\nWhat do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask\nfor reperations, then they hit us with tax\nAnd insurance if we live to be old, what about now?\nSo stop bein controlled, we black zombies\n\n\nWalkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)\nWalkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)\nWe just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)\n\n\nAiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars\nWe've already gone insane\nThey've already gave up, cut our own heads offs\nStab our own backs and dream too much\nwithout fulfillin reality; too greedy and\ncan't have one or two chains, we need three of dem\nCan't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em\non our own people and, fuck black leaders\ncause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic\nNas is divinity, the deity's prophetless\nAll get down and get up\nVictims walkin 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck\nFaintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church\nScared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin it first\nWe begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated\nJust to make another generation - black zombies\n\n\n\n\nYou scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance\nFeel free, hear the music and dance\nIf you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you\nDumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews\nor from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)\nIslam's a beautiful thing\nAnd Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring\npeace against the darkness, which is unGodly\nSo what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?\nUse your own intuition, you are tommorrow\n.. that's the sound of the beast\nI'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid\nControl your own destiny, you are a genius\nDon't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie\n\n\n\n\nWake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years\nGhetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?\nWhy listen to somebody else tell you how to do it\nwhen you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it\nDo it niggaz..\n",
