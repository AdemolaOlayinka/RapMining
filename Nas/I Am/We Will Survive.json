You know shit is rough after you slid\nYou in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid\nAin't nuttin changed -- still _Party and Bullshit_\nWe used to +Fuck R&B Bitches+ and see who rhyme sickest\nFor every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out\n_Machine Gun Funk_, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts\nYou came to my hood, we was broke\nI wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?\nStill on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so\nCause now with paper, shit is still ghetto\nBut fuck it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones\nPeace to your daughter and your newborn son\nIt used to be fun, makin records to see your response\nBut, now competition is none, now that you're gone\nAnd these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain\nAnd they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that\nIt's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you\nJoke with you, happy we on top, the most official\nAin't too many real ones out there; I feel some\nbut doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to\nI missed your wake not cause I'm fake\ncause I hate to see somebody so great in that way\nI woulda stayed so long with so much to say\nI had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin\nTellin me to pay my respects and move to the side\nBut I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by\nYou can't kill nothin that's _Ready to Die_\nYou was like God to us in the form of Allah\n\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\nThug Life never die..\n\nDear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth\nto bite off beer tops, and _Pour Out a Lil' Liquor_\nYou was more than just the wildest nigga\n+2Pacalypse+, I understand your style nigga\nIt's goin on the third year, since you've been gone\nOn the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on\nThe industry be talkin, offendin me often\nThey don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin\nI can relate, shootouts and court dates\n+All Eyez on You+, niggaz in your face invadin your space\nYou asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?\nHow long would I ride, before I fold up?\nHow did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?\nYou predicted it in every line, all in your flow\nThere could _Never Be Peace_ I have to quote\nCan't believe I heard my name on \"the realest shit you ever wrote\"\nWe had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top\nbut kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped\nin NYC, at MTV, people watched\nWe was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep\nThink about how us real niggaz would be\nIf we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?\nYou was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified\nlike the son of God, when Lucifer lied\nand make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?\nBut Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link\nWill there ever be another MC as nice?\nWill you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?\n\nStill somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?\n\n\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\n\nI wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?\nDid Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?\nWhat has Al Green seen, that made him religious?\nWas it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?\nIf so, should I put out the indo right now and write down\na plan and pursue my dream turn my life around\nCause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream\nI'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens\nIt be the ones you always knew, that want it on\nTellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on\nThought we walked a million miles it was just twenty\nNot used to walkin in the path of legit money\nI thought I made it but we only took baby steps\nUp the success ladder, where they pay me checks\nTo my clicks when I got it I said \"Baby bless\"\nThat was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess\nWe in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good\nHip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would\nA lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain\na couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here\nthe next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out\nSome is bout it, most individuals plots\nand run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves\nWhile others have no cares and stay in jail\nMore than fifty percent of us\nendin up with holes through the chest\nthrough the head, through the gut it shows\nThe future for us young shooters and old killers\nWho become rich as dope dealers?\nNothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments\nThug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap\nWe want the fast way outta this trap\nWhether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack\nTo my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back\nBut life is a dream and y'all taught me that\n\n.. always survive.. but why?\n\n\nAlways survive, always\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my people just stay alive\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive (no matter what)\nStill, we, will survive\nNo matter what, my niggaz just stay alive\n",
