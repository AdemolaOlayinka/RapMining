    "lyrics": "\"Nas is . . .\" -\n\n\nFreedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born\nSame time my man is murdered, the beginning and end\nAs far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain\nMy plateau, and also, what defines my name\nFirst it was Nasty, but times have changed\nAsk me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain\nI spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame\nSaw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine\nSaw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?\nThat depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim\nOn rooftops, tape cd covers to trees\nLine the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze\nStreet scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads\nTo the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough\nTo the big dogs livin large, takin it light\nPushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life\nis what you make it, suicide, few try to take it\nBelt tied around they neck in jail cells naked\nHeaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt\nAnd of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . .\nNAS, NAS\n\n\n\n\"Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel.. \"\n\"My poetry's deep, I never fell..\"\n\"Nas is like.. half man half amazing..\"\n\"No doubt..\"\n\n\n\"Nas is like..\" Earth Wind & Fire, rims and tires\nBulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver\nPlanets in orbit, line em up with the stars\nTarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas\n\"Nas is like..\" Iron Mike, messiah type\nBefore the Christ, after the death\nThe last one left, let my cash invest in stock\nCame a along way from blastin, techs on blocks\nWent from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres\nFrom the projects with no chips, to large cake dough\nDimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros\nBet my nine spit for the pesos\nBut what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth\nRich men died and tried, but none of it worked\nThey just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid\nBefore my number's called, history's made\nSome'll fall, but I rise, thug or die\nMakin choices, that determine my future under the sky\nTo rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why\nIt's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?\nMuch to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite\nSooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is\n\n\n\n\n\"Nas is like..\" Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet\nI'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows\nI'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper\nLike Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers\nI'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for\nAlways got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for\nI'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money\nCorporate accounts from a rich company\nI'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races\ncombined in one man; like the '99 summer jam\nBulletproof Hummer man\nI'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'\nI'm the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand\nI'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet\nLive it, and I write down and I watch it blow up\nY'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night\nNow..\n",
