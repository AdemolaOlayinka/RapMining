I'm the seller of minutes\nI give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is\nTime waits for none of you, in fact\nhe can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you\nSmall visions of better life if cheddar was right\nlurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time\nTrapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin\nHeaded for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin\nJudges is not relatin to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play\nRichochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes\nin bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.\nAround the way where we from\nHope the future reduce the rate of those buried young\nLife is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past\nand a newborn's, first time to be here at last\nAnd shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain\nHustlin harder than the generations here before he came\nGoin through the same bullshit as our fathers\nReadin history, but who's the authors?\nFor some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder\nBut never lose faith; through the years just get smarter\nGhetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..\n\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners rise rise rise\nGhetto prisoners..\n",
