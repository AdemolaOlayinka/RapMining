Against all odds, now?\nSabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkont\u00ea\nSabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\nSabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkont\u00ea\nSabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni\nNi k\u00eara m\u00f4g\u00f4\nWho wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?\nAnd was it a lightning storm\nThat gave birth to the Earth\nAnd then dinosaurs were born? damn\nWho made up words? Who made up numbers?\nAnd what kind of spell is mankind under?\nEverything on the planet we preserve and can it\nMicrowaved it and try it\nNo matter what we'll survive it\nWhat's hue? What's man? What's human?\nAnything along the land we consuming\nEatin', deletin', ruin\nTrying to get paper\nGotta have land, gotta have acres\nSo I can sit back like Jack Nicholson\nWatch niggas play the game like the Lakers\nIn a world full of 52 fakers\nGypsies, seances, mystical prayers\nYou superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders\nMake a wish for the day cuz\nLike somebody got a doll of me\nStickin' needles in my arteries\nBut I can't feel it\nSometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'\nI'm fearless.... I'm fearless\nDon't you try and grab hold of my soul\nIt's like a military soldier since seven years old\nI held real dead bodies in my arms\nFelt their body turn cold, oh\nWhy we born in the first place\nIf this is how we gotta go?\nDamn\n",
