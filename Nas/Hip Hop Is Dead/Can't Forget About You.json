    "lyrics": "There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back\nStraw hat on the porch when you old perhaps\nWanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one\nBrag, to your grandkids about how life is golden\nSo I will light a cigar in the corridor of the crib\nPictures on the wall of all the things that I did\nAll the money and fame, 8 by 10's\nof the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame\nCollidin with big names that could've made your career stop\nAll that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot\nWow, I need a moment y'all\nSee I almost felt a tear drop\n\n\nWhen was the last time you heard a real anthem\nNas, the millionaire, the mansion\nWhen was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme\nNever on schedule, but always on time\n\n\nThese streets hold my deepest days\nThis hood taught me golden ways\nMade me, truly this is what made me\nBreak me, not a thing's gonna break me\n\nOhh, I'm that history I'm that block\nI'm that lifestyle I'm that spot\nI'm that kid by the number spot\nThat's my past that made me hot\nHere's my life long anthem\nCan't forget about you\n(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you)\n\n\nCan't forget about the old school, Bam, Cas, Melle Mel, Flash\nRocksteady spinnin on they back\nCan't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince\nFat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since\nSo irregular, how it messed you up\nwhen Mr. T became a wrestler\nCan't forget about Jordan's retirement\nThe shot Robert Horry to win the game in the finals kid\nSome things are forever, some things are not\nIt's the things we remember that gave the world shock\nThey stay in a place in your mind so snug\nLike who the person was with whom you first make love\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now\nJust one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired\nIt's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died\nThat's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired\nHeinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines\nAnd I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times\nBut I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind\nThe past the past enough of it, aight then\nBut nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson\nOr Mike when his talk was live\nOr when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's why, darling, it's incredible\nThat someone so unforgettable\nThinks that I am unforgettable too\n",
