Is it MC Ren?\n\n\n\n\nHip hop just died this mornin'\nAnd she's dead, she's dead\n\n\nThe bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'\nCome through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'\nWhat influenced my raps? Stick ups and killings\nKidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings\nCriticize that, why is that?\nCuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap\nCuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'\nMost intellectuals will only half listen\nSo you can't blame jazz musicians\nOr David Stern with his NBA fashion issues\nOh I they like me--in my white tee\nYou can't ice me, we here for life B\nOn my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey\nAnd for that we not takin' it lightly\nIf hip hop should die we die together\nBodies in the morgue lie together\nAll together now\n\n\n\n\nHip hop just died this mornin'\nHip hop just died this mornin'\nHip hop just died this mornin'\nAnd she's dead, she's dead\n\n\n\n\nEverybody sound the same, commercialize the game\nReminiscin' when it wasn't all business\nIf it got where it started\nSo we all gather here for the dearly departed\nHip hopper since a toddler\nOne homeboy became a man then a mobster\nIf the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka\nR.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta\nWent from turntables to mp3s\nFrom \"Beat Street\" to commercials on Mickey D's\nFrom gold cables to Jacobs\nFrom plain facials to Botox and face lifts\nI'm lookin' over my shoulder\nIt's about eighty niggaz from my hood that showed up\nAnd they came to show love\nSold out concert and the doors are closed shut\n",
