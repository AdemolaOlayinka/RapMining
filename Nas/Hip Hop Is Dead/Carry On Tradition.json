WHAT?\n\n\nWhen they crown you - and you rise up to your position\n(Carry On Tradition)\nWhen they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition\n(Carry On Tradition) - (Carry On Tradition)\nCarry on, ca-carry on, (Carry On Tradition)\n(Carry On Tradition), when you rep what we rep\nThen (Carry On Tradition)\n\n\nNow niggaz got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer\nEngineers got his earplugs and still hear us\nThe live-in-the-park sound, versus the studio state of art sound\nWe on the charts now; from British Walkers and Argyles\nLook at us rap stars now, wit our black cars now\nFortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's\nSippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me\nThick white girls around me, Chinese lined up\nBecause I'm what?, every dime lust\nWe used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up\nIf I want that or the whole world to peep it\nNow (Carry On Tradition)\nFuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'\nPeace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em\nI promise I (Carry On Tradition)\n\n\nWhen they crown you - and you rise up to your position\n(Carry On Tradition)\nWhen they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition\n(Carry On Tradition) - (Carry On Tradition)\nCarry on, ca-carry on, (Carry On Tradition)\n(Carry On Tradition), when you rep what we rep\nThen (Carry On Tradition)\n",
