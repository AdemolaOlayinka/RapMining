Hah\n\n\nThe G-O-D S-O-N\nK-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C\nThat's me\n\n\nIs it because I got the city on smash now\nOh woe woe\nOr is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now\nHey hey hey hey\n\n\nIn the papers you read that Nas is crazy\nLost his mind as he leavin Sony\nThe INC got him signed\nIt's only a figment of your imagination\nWent to way with New York's Hot radio station\nLost my patience, had to zone out\nRappers blown out, I have the throne now\nThe real shall reign, I feel your pain\nYou R&B, follow me, spell my name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGod's Son across the belly\nPardon, I'm hardly a bully\nBut what y'all done to hip hop is scary\nNas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with\nHoldin it down, my proteges are over with now\nA producer like Swizz Beats, on fire\nSo is the control room, soon as my vocals are down\nNas - God's Son, and y'all my little children\nSo bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin\n",
