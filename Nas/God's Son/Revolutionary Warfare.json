I picture him standing with diamonds on him\nLittle different from the way my mommy saw him\nPractice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and\nTest your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging\nSplitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school\nTeaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool\nBut chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it\nSleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out\n\n\n\n\nMy revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build\nWith dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills\nfor fish scale, to cop guns, the time come\nI'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus\nFuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese\nAnd feed him to the rats in the back of the P's\nBlack fatigues and ? on the sofa\n50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters\nMy motions don't appeal to repel at divisions\nI did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system\nI'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga\nOnly killas know my face\nI beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake\nThough simultaneously the street revolution\n21 gun salute the new Huey Newton\n\n\n\n\nTeach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers\nProtect the children, grab revolvers\nThe women plays important part of our life force\nSo what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war\nUh, And listen more talk less\nWatch all and trust none, demand your respect\nAnd be ready to die for what you believe in\nAnd ride all the time not just when convenient\nJustice and freedom, wisdom and understanding\nWe the lost children of Israel in this western world region\nYou ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in\nStrong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong\nIt's more to a war than just getting it on\nConceal your form, cover your tracks\nStay prepared I don't care if no one's spared\n",
