I shoot your freckles out\nYou too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about\nHuh? I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses\nSecretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy\nWe can sell mo', boats on the coast\nGive, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low\nBut that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky\nYou see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3\nwill love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil\nBITCH! You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on\n'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on\nFrom here on, it's a new day\nMillion dollars ain't, what it was yesterday\nMany problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake\nHope y'all relate\n\n\n\nI carry the cross\n",
