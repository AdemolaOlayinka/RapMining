    "lyrics": "The phone rings\nAnother peaceful moment is lost\nLatifah's chest jingle in \"Set It Off\"\nI press pause in the bed as a king\nI let it ring 4 or 5 times\nAnswer while I'm puffin' my green\nIt's Tamika sayin', \"Hi Nas\"\nI caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that\nShe offered me dinner under the moon\nI said, \"Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room\"\nNine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up\nThe pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila\nPut on my Lee's and the original Fila's\nSedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails\nLike Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose\nDrivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go\nHeads turn it's a freak show\nI need them to know... When will they learn\nNas need a queen not a hoe to...\nPoint out my enemies, a girl who's into me\nBut not a hype chick- someone with proper energy\nSomeone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies\nAnd you can sing along 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy\n\n\nHey Nas... How ya doin'?\nTake my name... And my number\nMeanwhile... We'll be groovin'\nBut let's take... it... slow\n\n\nOne for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke\nTwo for the few who see potential in you when you broke\nThree for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you\nDouble life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you\nHere's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'\nGet to a man's heart through his stomach\nYou gotta be skilled in the culinary arts\nKnow a brother stay mad hungry when he spark\nHit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart\nPicture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart\nIf I want Chinese then you buy me a wok\nIf you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock\n'Cuz u... point out my enemies, someone who's into me\nBut not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy\nA girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies\nAnd you could be the one 'cuz I'm lovin' ya energy\n\n\nHey Nas... How ya doin'?\nTake my name... And my number\nMeanwhile... We'll be cruisin'\nBut let's take... it... slow\n\n\nSlow is the way\nHoldin' hands, tongue and hickeys\nHope and I pray where I run at you run away with me\nThat's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there\nHear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years\nLike noone else in the world did this except for us two\nYou gotta trust me, I gotta trust you\nIf coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo\nYou rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you\nRetired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'\nAs we... suck and fuck each other's minds out commission\nTime's out forbidden\nUntil we pass out, that's when we stop\nWe give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot\nGive it all we got, give it all we got- we rock\nGive it all we got, give it all we got\nYou 'bout the baddest thing\nSince Michael had Billy Jean\nAnd Prince gave you diamond's and pearls\nBut to be my queen you must...\nPoint out my enemies, a girl who's into me\nBut not a hype chick- someone with proper energy\nSomeone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies\nAnd you can be the one 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy\n\n\nHey Nas... How ya doin'?\nTake my name... And my number\nMeanwhile... We'll be cruisin'\nBut let's take... it... slow\n\n\nI can be... What you said\nThat you need... I can be...All that\nI can be... I can have your back... baby\n",
