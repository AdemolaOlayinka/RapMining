I'ma die rich\nSo let the money talk for me, fuck the nonsense\nHold me down, be my ride or die bitch\nWe fuck then we fight, we fight then we fuck\nI'ma beat it up tonight like Kimbo Slice\nCome live the proper life, no I ain't the shoppin type\nI might take you out to eat, we can grab a bite\nNow let me grab my bike and roll yo' ass through Crescent Heights\nUp in Hollywood, step into the limelight\nand hit this bubble kush, let me get your mind right\nThis is \"Wonderland,\" let your mind take flight\nWe gotta hurry up, I'm only here for one night\n\n\nThis next girl Bird, she from the suburbs\nand live by herself, like cars and nice furs\nand loves hip-hop - The Neptunes and Murs\nBut I'm her favorite rapper, my biggest fan is her\nI like her skin tone, and how her figure curves\nWe smoke mad kush and drink until our vision blur\nAnd then I pat her down, like she gettin searched\nI fuck her with my chain on, she pulls on my shirt\nlike nigga don't stop, until the pussy squirt\nI hit it twice and bone out, she went back to work\nThis happens all the time, I gotta go rehearse\nfor my next show, I tour on May 1st\nGet yo' mind right, and this may work\nYou know love is pain, and havin faith hurts\nYou rollin with the best, so grab your heels and purse\nand welcome to \"Wonderland\" the best place on Earth\nUhh, you gon' love me!\n(\"And ohh you're gonna love me\")\n(\"You're gonna wanna hug me, and\") squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me\n",
