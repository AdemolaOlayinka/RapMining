Bet I solve it fastly\n\n\n\n\nWe gangbang on these niggaz like we 'posed to do\nand I'll be damned if I let a bitch get close to you\nWe posted Boo - you, my, one and only\nQuick to dump before the homies\nRemember when that phony nigga ran up on me at the club?\nYou filled him up with slugs, that's what I call love\nAll that pushin and shovin, kissin and huggin\nThuggin, dig it, dug-in\nI'm lovin every minute of it Boo\nThe way you stay true, and always kept your cool\nYou kept the heater right by your thigh\nAnd when the shit got hectic you was ready to ride\nYou didn't run out, when I pulled the gun out\nThat's what I'm talkin bout, no doubt\nRuff Rydin, Eastsidin, to the realest y'know\nD-O-double-Gizze, you know how we get busy\n\n\nAiyyo, how could I leave a real nigga? A real nigga's all I need\nFake bitches try to take my place, fall to they knees\nDon't violate, see my man, he don't like no scrapes\nAnd if I heard you was frontin I hope on the case\nWild one? Maybe, but I'ma protect my baby\nTest me fool and by the end you gon' think I'm crazy\nThat's how I do for my Dogg, keep my (?) strong\nBoth sides relied on the shit, nigga sing the song\n\n\n\n\nYeah.. hahah, E-V-E! D-O-double-Gizze! Y'know!\nRuff Rydin, Eastsidin! Foe life, ahh! Yeah..\nAnd you thought it'd never happen\nFuck the haters, bow wow!\nWoof.. woof.. woof.. woof..\nBEOTCH!\nIt's official now, yeah\nWe gon' Ruff Ryde up on out of here on this one\nEastside up Eastsidaz\nGoldie Loc in the house\nLil' 1/2 Dead\nDJ Jam, my nigga E, Davey Dave, uhh, misbehave\nGive it to 'em Dogg\nWhattup DMX? WOOF!\nMaster P? UNNNGHH!\nDr. Dre\nMy nephew Scott on the beat\nIlly Philly-delphia\n\n\nAwwwwwww, yeah babyyy!\nIt's another one, funky as they come\nEvey Eve and Doggy Dogg\nBitch please, awwww!\n",
