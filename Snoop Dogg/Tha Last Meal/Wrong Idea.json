Holla at 'em\n\n\n\n\nI keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East\nOn a bitch I remain the beast, none the least\nPolice try to cuff me and stuff me in the back\nof they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star\nWith the cool name, this nigga here's a fool mayn\nGo on and do yo' thang, gang-bang\nin the hood and in Hollywood\nRecord company executives think it's all to the good\nGet to showin me around they house, then he slide me in the back\nand had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out mayn\nI'm down with P, and D-R-E\nA real nigga from the motherfuckin L.B.C.\nI just look like this, I stay down for the twist\nI'm real with this, deep as abyss\nI gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss\nI had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullsheeit\n",
