It didn't make sense\n\nI'm a family man sportin a weddin band\n\n\nI heard them niggas on your pager didn't give a damn\nI gave you eighty percent of all my trust in you\nThe other twenty was cool, cause we gon' make it through\n\nThe homies said she got my mind blew in, blew in\n\n\nI told that nigga like Chris Tucker,\n\"Don't worry about what the FUCK I be doin'\"\nWe was makin chemistry, but who is he?\nAnd how dis nigga know the deal about you and me?\n\nI fell to my knees and asked the girl \"Why?\"\n\n\nShe looked at my eyes with no reply\nSo I cried, I was in love at times\nI was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes\n\n\n\n\nI was in love at times\nI was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes\nI was in love at times\nI was so hurt, she made me forget my rhymes\nI was in love at times\nThey say \"Game Don't Wait\" huh Warren G?\nWell the game better wait for me\nI'm spendin my time while I'm writin these rhymes\nIn the Hills for real, sippin wines, girl you'se a dime\nGot me losin my mind\nWell if lovin you is a crime\nI'm down to do my time\nLock me up and throw away the key\nI once told that \"This was the way love was meant to be\"\nI see you with me forever\nWe can do things that you never, thought you coulda\nUp out the hood-uh, is where I took you, never overlooked you\nI can't believe that you shook to another spot\nAnd left me cold, now I'm hot\nI'm tryin to find you, what am I to do?\nI gave you everything that you needed\n\n\n\n\nTook it for granted, shit, I'm cool now\nWhat goes around, comes around\n\nI was in love at times\nI was in love at times\nI was in love at times\nI was in love at times\n\n\nYou know what girl I mean..\nI was in love with you and you did me like that\nBut you know what they say?\nWhat goes around comes around\n\n\nHow could, how could, you do me wrong?\nYou be messin up my songs (my songs)\nNow a nigga must move on (I gave you)\nGave love, and you just, straight played on me (on me)\nHad a nigga sick for weeks (for weeks)\nNow I must begin my streak (I was in love at times..)\n",
