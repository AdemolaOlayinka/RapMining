Forreal\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYes I'm the most high\nBaby want it, Mimosa\nI tried to reverse her, a mentirosa\nGov me livin' the vida loca in Acapulco\nWith my pictures on the wall on a poster, a roller coaster\nSo I try to dance my life away to get it over\nI'm sippin' Jamison with famous friends until I'm sober\nDon't wanna go home, I know I'm gonna get into a fight\nI called my sidepiece and tell her I'mma spend the night\nAnd if she out of town, baby we' gon' book a flight\nShe got it laid out with incense and candlelights\nYour shit's on hit, officially lit\nYou're tryna get a nigga sprung, your pussy wet, you lil bit\nYou have no idea, what? You want me right here?\nAre you sure that we can do this shit right here?\nCause if it's on like that, I'll spend the night here\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nGood love, good sex and good weed\nBaby oil to rub down my sleeves, relax and breathe\nRed wine, crackers and cheese, baby shootin' the breeze\nWhile aiming to please\nOh please, don't stop with the antics\nHigh heels, t-shirts, no panties\nMe knockin', she's rockin' the boat\nWhile baking me a cake with a root beer float\nThen put the TV on the channel where's it's nothin' but sports\nEvery room at the house is where I smoke my dope, no joke\nGot keys to the spot so I can slide by necessary\nMary, Mary, Quite Crip Contrary\nApartment contemporary\nJo Malone candles, very airy\nAin't that right Siri? (That's right Siri)\nSo keep sendin' that right\nThe way it's lookin', I'll be spendin' the night\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nYou don't have to leave\nYou can stay at my house, I aims to please\nJust relax and breathe\nYou deserve attention, I'm what you need\nI'm on my way, yeah\nJust leave the backdoor open\nI'm pullin' up right now\nAnd I'mma spend the night\nFo' sho'\n",
