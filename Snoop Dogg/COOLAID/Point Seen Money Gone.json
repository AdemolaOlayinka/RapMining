I through the tarp\nAt the wall, off the wall\nI feel like Mike, I don't miss\nNiggas talkin' shit\nSaying I didn't fuck that pussy into one-nighty\nHItting that pussy quit was just aight, uhh\nNot at all I ain't get to see the wall\nI cocked 'em off, fuck them all\nFuck the law, fuck you thought\nI ain't change, seen my chain looks like the car\nFlashy man, flashy this and dancing on me\nDirty dancing, dancing like my double cup\nLemonade to niggas that be acting tough\nSee you got money I just double up\nMultiply, fuck addition, fuck your position\nMacauley Culkin, rich and riches\nThis the life, then walk away it's so delicious\nUp in Dubai, Sushi hella bitches\nAw man wrote a check, 2 commas, lean lean\nTell em' I need two shots, or two o' clock\nPlus that adds about 2000, teardrops\nPull up with my crew in silent nights\n\nI need a girl who will do whatever I want\nI need a girl who will do whatever I want\n",
