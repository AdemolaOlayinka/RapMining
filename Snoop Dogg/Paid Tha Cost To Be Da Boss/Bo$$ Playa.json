(Yes I will)\nWill you kill for me? (Yes I will)\nWould you lie to me? (Never)\nWould you die for me? (Whenever)\n\nWill you steal for me? (Yes I will)\nWill you kill for me? (Yes I will)\nWould you lie to me? (Never)\nWould you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)\n\n\nBig Snoop Dogg, lets you know ..\nThat this game ain't for no lame ..\nIf you got heart, you can play this game\nBut if your heart ain't right\nWe got a remedy for that, too\nYou gotta go see the wizard .. to get you some heart\nAnd the archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard\nThat's got the game .. for them lame\nBoss Playa .. Boss Playa .. that's what this gang is all about\nBoss Playa\n\n\n\n\nGangsta, Gangsta, where you been?\nRound the corner messin' with brothanem\nYoungsta, Youngsta, you at it again?\nPoppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends\nI don't think that you should be in the streets like that\nYou know you the fashion type of cat\nAlways in them stores, with major whores\nDoin' things, bling bling\nWest Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' in the green\nWith the sticky in yo hand fo sho\nEverybody round ya cause they know you got mo'\nWet Cristal, you like to get wild\nYou like to dip in yo sexy shit\nRollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT\nL.B.C. rollin' with me, ohh\n",
