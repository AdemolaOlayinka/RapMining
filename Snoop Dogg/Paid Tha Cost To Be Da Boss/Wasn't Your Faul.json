I got a homey sittin' by me\nUnderstand this nigga don't understand because he's a young nigga\nYou know what I'm sayin'? I'm been in the game since '85\nAnd I know a ho don't do nothin', wanna play a nigga like 9 to 5, alright\n\n\nYIKES, Shabba dabble do I can dig it baby, you know\nBecause these hoes, they can't be controlled\nYou gotta find 'em, spot 'em, send 'em, get em, got 'em, you know\n\n\nIt wasn't (uh uh) your fault (it wasn't your fault)\nYou was only tryin' to be nice (tryin' be nice)\nOnly tryin to be nice, ohh (can't be nice to these hoes)\nYou know you can't control these hoes (no, no, no)\nYou know you can't control these hoes (can't control these hoes)\nYou know you can't control these hoes\n\n\nWhat she do, she jumped out of her sleep and left the pad at a quarter to two\nThat's on you, you shoulda put your foot in her ass, like a pimp's supposed to do\nBut instead of goin' 'upside da head'\nYou bought her a 5 karat wit your bread\nAnd then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head\nI ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin', what you do\nWhen your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do\nWhat we do, we check 'em from the gate, to keep a bitch straight\nIt's on you, see you can take her out and buy her all types of things\nYou's a fool, cause when she leave you, for what he do\nYou'll see fool\n\n\n\n\nMe and you, that's what you thought 'til your ass got caught\nShame on you, and now I understand why my momma used to tell me that\nAin't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat\nGame on you, cause now you back at your momma house\nAnd you sleepin' on tha copeasack\nWhat's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac\nSay it ain't true, she let a nigga drive it, ask tha homie Battlecat\nWhatchu do, put my foot in her ass and mashed tha gas\nYou know me, and ever since that day my nigga, I've been P I M P\n\n\n\n\nThats your boo, but she know every nigga in the Roc-A-Fella Crew\nThat's on you, baby blow too much, I mean she know too much\nThat's my boo, it's all about who she did and where she been\nI love you, you shouldn't a told her that, you should a smacked her flat\nShame on you (shame on you), your so in love you fittin' to get a tattoo\nThat ain't cool (that ain't cool), love is blind and no friend of mine\nIf I was you, I'd a packed her bags and bust anotha bitch thats bad\nGame got rules, if you lose a ho, you gotta gain a ho\n",
