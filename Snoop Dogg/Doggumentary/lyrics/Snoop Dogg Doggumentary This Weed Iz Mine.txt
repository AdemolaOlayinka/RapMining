Snoop Dogg
Doggumentary
2011)
I wake up early in the morning and it feels so good
Smoking on some shit that you wish you could
Jealousy envy please don't feel bad
This weed is mine get your own bag
A sack full of O.G. under lock and key
None for the homies this is all for me
Got a blunt looking like a Cali palm tree
Police roll by I got nothing on me
Cause the smokes already in the air
I'm locc'd up with two braids in my hair
All star star with the khaki suit
I'm a fuck around and take it back to classic Snoop
On the east side standing on the V.I.P.
Back then the only red was E-Y-E
You's a P.Y.T. and you looking so fine
I'm sorry baby girl but tonight
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine
Back to the episode sacks full of chronic
Out of this world could relax on a comet
This is church music listen to the choir
To burn my kush you must use fire
D-O double G like never heard before
Smoking that bomb like T-H-C 4
West coast worldwide seashore to seashore
When's the last time you seen a G in a G4
Don't worry I'll wait
Times ticking I'm tripping I'm slipping away
Into a zone where these hoes on my dog bone
A dog whistle and they download my ringtone
And she's so hypnotized by this pimp's poem
What I got here is mine gone get your own
I put beats to rhymes get peace of mind
O-Z's to dimes and this weed is mine
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine

I hear niggas talking bout what they rolling up
Smell what I smoke fore the bag open up
Good chance if you see me then I'm smoking one
Licensed to get it from the men who grow the shit
Real nigga blowing weed before I was old enough
If I'm in the building it's hard not to notice it
Hit up Willie said dog I got some hoes to fuck
I'm a fall through with an ounce of that potent shit
Don't trip nigga we gonna all sip blow the whole zip
Let you hit mine plus you supplying your own lil bit
My nigga get high and let the hoes twist
Say you don't fuck with twists look how you rolled it
They ain't smoking like ours I'm rolling up paper they be burning for hours
And if it's fire I'm smoking the whole thing entire
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine
This weed is mine you can't have it
This weed is mine
I got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you do you wanna smoke with me
I got a roll for you do you wanna smoke with me
I wanna smoke with you do you do you
