Fuck you nigga!\nYeah nigga, whassup?\nNigga?\nYeah motherfucker\nYeah nigga, one less nigga\nYeah nigga, youse a dead motherfucker now\n\n\n\nAs I look up at the sky\nMy mind starts trippin, a tear drops my eye\nMy body temperature falls\nI'm shakin and they breakin tryin to save the Dogg\nPumpin on my chest and I'm screamin\nI stop breathin, damn I see deamons\nDear God, I wonder can ya save me\nI can't die Boo-Boo's bout to have my baby\nI think it's too late for prayin, hold up\nA voice spoke to me and it slowly started sayin\n\"Bring your lifestyle to me I'll make it better\"\nHow long will I live?\n\"Eternal life and forever\"\nAnd will I be, the G that I was?\n\"I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of\nSo relax your soul, let me take control\nClose your eyes my son\"\nMy eyes are closed\n\n\n\nMurder... murder was the case that they gave me\nMurder... murder was the case that they gave me\n\n\n\nI'm fresh up out my coma\nI got my momma and my daddy and my homies in my corner\nIt's gonna take a miracle they say\nFor me to walk again and talk again but anyway\nI get, fronted some keys, to get, back on my feet\nAnd everything that nigga said, came to reality\nLivin like a baller loc\nHavin money, and blowin hella chronic smoke\nI bought my momma a Benz, and bought my Boo-Boo a Jag\nAnd now I'm rollin in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad\n\"Just remember who changed your mind\nCuz when you start set-trippin, that ass mine\"\nIndeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed\nNever have a want, never have a need\nThey say I'm greedy but I still want mo'\nCuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe (check it out)\n\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the lord, my soul to keep\nIf I should die, before I wake\nI pray the lord, my soul to take\n\nNo more indo, gin and juice\nI'm on my way to Chino, rollin on the grey goose\nShackled from head to toe\n25 with an izzl, with nowhere to gizzo, I know\nthem niggaz from the other side recognize my face\nCuz it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C\nMad doggin niggaz cuz I don't care\nRed jumpsuit with two braids in my hair\nNiggaz stare as I enter the center\nThey send me to a leval 3 yard, that's where I stay\nLate night I hear toothbrushes scrapin on the floor\nNiggaz gettin they shanks, just in case the war, pops off\nCuz you can't tell what's next\nMy little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck\nAnd he probably won't make it, to see twenty-two\nI put that on my momma, I'ma ride for you Baby Boo\n",
