    "lyrics": "Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie\nwhile you're bangin on ya baby OG's\nThat's why I flip the script to the boogie bang homey\nIf I'm hangin it's with DPG\n\n\n\n\nSome do the things that they do cos they dumb\nand some do the things that they do for crumbs\nI do mine for me ya see?\nNot the big homey double O-G\nScared to do your own work, man that's fast\nand that's the reason why I had to shoot you down\nbecause you never should've tried to work my Dogg\nand the lil homey wouldn't had no reason to bump\nY'all know the game ain't the same no mo'\nLil G's keep heat so big G's freeze, geez!\nJohnny Rockafella went to jail-er\nfew many times too many and became a teller\nThey sell a nigga dreams if he want em\nbut they won't sell you the game to get up on em\nYa tryin ta find em cos you want em, they shook out\nGet the book out and when the pitch come, nigga look out\nit ain't hard to pump up the lil homies nigga\nbut it's hard for your bitch ass to get wit us\nBut it's steel, you put it in their head\nthat at 13 they better off dead (now they gone)\n\n\n\n\n\nAiyo Snoop, why would niggas get into the bracket\nand make a loot, niggas want trip\nSpittin like \"you spoke beef from the hood\nShow me love nigga or don't show me shit\"\nFeel the fever, million dollar male like Cole Severs\nMade a non-believin man into a believer\nReceive a cheque the next day, my homies say\n\"it's the way to get paid\", DP's and pay\nI don't know why you wanna get on my back? (why?)\nTrippin cos you know the bomb's at where I'm at\nWell if that's the case you shoulda roll\nwit the PG instead of losing control (motherfucker)\nThis is how we do, Dogg Pound Gangstas in blue\nMe, D-A-Z, N-A-T-E and Snoop\nNiggas from Seth be tryin to set you cos you settin your ways\nso ask DJ Pooh what pays\n\n\n\n\n\nJust what we need, bangin on wax another trip\nWhat you gon' do nigga, jack the mothership?\nYou're like a actor wit another script\nPredictable as Rambo wit another clip\nHow many niggas you gon' kill in your verse?\nYou need to sit down and learn to get down first\ncos, uhh, real hoo-bangers are toast-slangers\nnot part-time FBI singers\nNiggas havin bad intentions, sendin BG's on a mission\nOne move too many, nigga you missin\nListen you fuck wit the cyco-lic-no\nloony ass nigga from your H-doubleO-D\nNiggas got too flossy from all the sex they tossin\nbut guess what it cost em, they crossin me\nBut before I give a nigga a 9\nI'd rather give a nigga a mic and write him a rhyme\n",
