Ooh.....Wee!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nIt's a whole 'nother day\nI'm back up in ya'\nSnoop D-O-Double G\nI representa'\nBeen away for a while but you all know\nI'm still doggystylin' on Death Row\nGot shit locked down\nSewed up\nSo If you plan on comin' out nigga hold up.\nThis a stick up\ndick up\nThey got yo' shit on the shelf, oh mine is too\nand guess who they gon' pick up?\nSome niggas think they know they shit\nBut they don't\nSome M-A's escape\nSome won't\nBumpin' heads with niggas\nWhere you from?\nEast Side Long Beach, nigga, 2-1\nThe homie just got paroled\nAnd he got more stories than the highway patrol\nTellin' me about the money Suge Knight stole\nBut I'll make that shit late\nCause nigga I get swole\nNiggas tryin' to get in, to get out.\nPut me up on game tellin' me who gon' jack me\nBut ever since\nI was a puppy\ntill I was paroled\nI never had no other dog pullin' on my chrome.\n\n\nSay Snoop's upside yo' head,\nsay Snoop's upside yo' head.\n\n\nNiggas in the game be doin' way too much\nAkin' tough with this east-west coast stuff.\nSee Me\nI'm all about my money mane\nI stay fly and dry\nI don't get caught up in the rain\nCuz game recognize game\nNo matter where you from\nWe all can get dumb, insane and\nturn the party out\nwithout a doubt\nUnless\nyou them niggas who ain't got no clout\nLBC and B what?\nUh, my crew\nCuz uh, we out there smokin' on the krazy glue\nUpside yo' head like oops\nSnoop's\nThe shit, that you hear them bumpin' in the hoops.\nCan't afford it\nhomeboy\nThis is finished\nI represented\nFrom V-A to Venice\nSo when it's timid\nAnd cold outside\nRely on the Doggy Dogg\nTo put the heat in yo' life\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a whole lot\nto be number one\nI can't walk down the street\nwithout my gun\nI can't trust these niggas fool\nIt ain't no fun\nI'm sittin' up in court\nCuz somebody got dumped\nWhat really counts is how the crowd bounce\nGo home and say\nSnoop rocked the parte`\nNobody got kilt\nIt's what got annouced\nI guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay\nBut I keep my heat in case niggas get cold\nWarm you up with the sheet\nZip you up and roll\nNow Doggystyle records is now official\nGettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials\nShippin' weapons overseas\nI'm makin' G's\nWhat who you make call enemies\nBut I\nSee nothing funny about\nmakin' money\nCuz uh\nWe all know it don't grow on trees\nSo I\nGotta' get what I gotta' get when I can\nUp homie in the mo'ning wit' the gat van\nBurning rubber down to get a new car\nSo don't get jealous when you see me in the\ndouble R.\n",
