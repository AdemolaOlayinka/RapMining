She bit the shit out of me\n???? bitch is a trick, I had to get cold feet\nto get the bitch up off me\nand I can't tame her and I can't blame her\nThat's why I had to name her the top Dogg gamer\nMan, it's a shame-uh nigga got love for y'all\nbut I got more love for my motherfuckin Doggz\nIt's just....\n\n\n\nMe & my Doggz (sick em), me & my Doggz (sick em)\n(Beware, beware) Me & my Doggz\n\n\n\nNow when it comes to my Doggz they stay fly like geese\nbut as for me I'm Snoop Dogg I'm soopafly like Priest\nI unleash my Doggz then I tilt my brim\nI'm bout to trip off Locko cos he go taken my swim\nI think cos my CREAMy low, get back to the pound\nHe gon' be itchin like hell to put the bite on the clown\nand when you look with the frown he gon' get like 1-2\nand ain't a damn thang that your ass can do\nI think it's cos he lost his big homey Don Killer see\nwho ran the whole yard and gangbanged OP\nand leave your ass red and yeah half-head\nHe's a damn fool, he'll jack you for pants leg\nDon't beg you're dead, and don't dare show fear\nYoung gangsta fucked wit Scrappy and Red tore off his head\nand all the kid do was cry like a bitch\nHis life was a pit and mine's in the shit\n\n\n\n(Beware, beware)\n(Sick em) It's just me & my Doggz\nI keep my heat in my seat, my killers in my backyard\nJust in case you niggas wanna fuck and try to act hard\n\n\n\n....deadly serious in East Los Angeles and South Central where people\nencounter stray dogs on a daily basis and often bare the scars to prove it)\n",
