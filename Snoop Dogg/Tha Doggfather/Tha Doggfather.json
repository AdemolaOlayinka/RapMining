    "lyrics": "I put down more hits than mafioso made\nAnd Lucky Lucianno 'bout to sing soprano\nAnd I know, I know the way you feel\nAnd baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real\nJust to get you caught up in amazement\nWe puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous\nBut when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack\nAnd let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha\nHow you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villan\nMakin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo,\nOutfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes\nMan, I'm givin' blues to these sucka MC's\nWho you be? You know who I be, young nigga\nI'm Tha DoggFather\n\n\nSnoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)\n\n\nLet's make a move for this paper (Where we rollin' Dogg?)\nWe got's ta get paid (Makin' money all ya'll)\nI mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance\nAnd say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance\nI'm so fly like a dove\nI come from up above\nYou trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love\nNigga don't beat em, cause if you beat em, you don't need em\nYou lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom\nI delete em, but don't mistreat em\nI stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on,\nLet me flow on\nYou can rock to tha rythme you see\nor you can rock to tha rythme of me\nJust remember when you do your thang,\nMake sure you do your thang on a hang\nAnd everythang, is everythang\nThere ain't no mo' than this paper chase\nLike them white-boy DA's was on tha case\nYou know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh,\n(Murder, murder, murder) was the case that they lost\nI'm Tha DoggFather\n\n\n\nNow, do anybody in tha house remember\nWhen there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)\nThere wasn't no rappers hollin' 'bout LBC\nAm I trippin' ya'll? (Hell no!)\nNow, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop\nHave prestigious women\nThat's the truth from the begining\nIn and out of the flyest hotels\nYou say your family don't know me\nHold on hommie, that's formost and promos\nSales, tails, scales and jails\nSuccess before death\nNo one in my clique fails\nAs females with the almighty Father lead\nSucceedin' ta give my peep's just what they need\nAnd it ain't no party like this kind,\nCause you can leave your worries behizzind\nBut I'ma git back to tha grizzind\nSnoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and\nI'm tha DoggFather\n",
