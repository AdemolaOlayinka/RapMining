When you're awake
When lightening strikes you know
When you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know
When you're awake
With the G come to the light
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Smell the aroma, visualise
Do not try to get higher than me
Why stop it there? Get high as can be

It's time to spark up some 
Feel the blaze
The  number one (there's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake

My name is Snoop Dogg, not to complain
I gets my groove on, I do my thing
My planet's Krypton, home of the freaks
Come get your moon rocks, I am a G
