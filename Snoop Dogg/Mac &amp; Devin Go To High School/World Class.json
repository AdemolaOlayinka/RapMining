Am I right? Do I care? Livin life\nOn my own, cop a zone, what it feelin like\nTransition, premonition, whatchacallit, Mac a bone\nDo my thang with my gang, put your back up on\nRecollect and reflect, on how I used to be\nI'm probably the same way cuz cause I'm gon' keep it G\nSecretly, sacredly, y'all wake and bake with me\nSolo creepin on the dolo tippin like a low-low\nFans come in vans and clans expectin to get that photo\nOr either come backstage and have a chance to hit my dodo\nCool individual, I'm never too good\nSee Mac is from the hood, and never Hollywood\n\n\nUh, growin up I ain't know as much\nI was too busy chasin money and rollin stuff 'fore I was old enough\nGettin every dollar and fold it up\nPuttin all our weed in papers instead of blunts so they can know it's us\nEvery party we showin up\nBaggie full of pre-rolls, light it up and pass it\nYou holdin that one too long nigga, matter fact you can have it\nAnother one in rotation, my motivation is cabbage\nMy Roley face filled with karats\nAnd niggaz think they are but they know that they ain't comparin\nAnd ain't doin no harm, I just don't think I'm into carin\nI keep makin deposits and know ain't no interference from your broke ass\nI just keep hustlin all the time and gettin mo' cash\nAnd rollin weed, you smell the chronic when I go past\nYou look at me and then put down notes on your notepad\nYeah I'm kinda high, but you should know that - hahaha\n",
