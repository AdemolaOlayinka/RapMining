French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

Uhh, you ain't gotta sell it, cause its already sold
And you ain't gotta roll one cause its already rolled
Check out my technique, just weed, let it flow
Shit, I've been smoking since I was 14 years old
I had a dime that never smoked blunts, just bowls
Taught me how to blow O's, inhale through my nose
So if you see me smoking don't blow my high
Uhhh, so I roll one and we both gonna fly
You smell it all in my clothes
I'm taking in all the smoke when I...

French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again

I take it to the face, inhale it through my nose
Blowing with the homies on the low, man fuck these hoes
And crack-a-lac, peel it back
What you call a mack who crack a mad bitch like that?
A cracker jack
Im like a florist, touring like a tourist
Godzilla flyin on a pegasaurus
Niggas know about it, even fore I pull it out
I put some fire on it, and now they beggin me to put it out
I'm in the hallway, rolling on the purple psyche
I know the in's and out's so I'mma do what the fuck I like

French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
French inhale
I like the way you french inhale
Do it again
