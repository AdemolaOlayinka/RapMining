(Wow!)\nThat's cold game, a ho thing,\nI'm high as Soul Plane, I smoked the whole thing,\nYou know how daddy do it, I'm true to it,\nI take a cocaine, bew it then put some blue to it!\nThat's some gangster shit, these hoes love this gangster dick,\nKhaki's and some gangster kicks, yeah, bitch, that's my gangster fit,\nI'm balling boy, and you ain't got to ask,\nShe all about this pimping, I'm all about this cash,\n",
