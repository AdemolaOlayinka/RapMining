    "lyrics": "1992, \"Deep Cover\" hit the world and fell in love with Snoop\n\"Doggystyle\" came out, it's like I dropped a bomb\nOne of the greatest hip-hop records of all time\nI was young gettin' money, livin' wild and free\nGot on and I brought the whole Pound with me\nDidn't matter who's around, I kept it way too G\nNiggaz knew it was Eastside L.B.C.\nGangsta shit, that's what a motherfuckin' gangsta get\nThe one up above didn't like my pace\nI was movin' too fast and I caught that case\nI fought that case, wonder where the West would be if I'da lost that case\nI slow mine down, swimmin' with the sharks and I almost drowned\n\n\nI done made some mistakes along the way\nTo become the G I am today\nWho had ever thought I'd make this far?\nOut the hood to be a big star\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere\nHomie I ain't never comin' down\nI'm too high in the clouds\nTo ever have to worry 'bout that\n\n\nI'm finally out\nAnd the critics hated on me 'cause I went to the South\nSaid I wasn't gon' shine, had me left for dead\nSwitched sides, now my old boss want me dead\nDropped the first of the three and you said it was weak\n\"No Limit Top Dogg\", the return of the beast\nSo from that point on I know what to do\nDon't worry 'bout them just do what you do\n\"Last Meal\" was the one that took me off the leash\nThat's the last time a nigga gon' eat off of me\nStack plaque after plaque, gain millions sold\nI'm the Bo$$ of this bitch and I ain't never went Gold, nigga\n\n\nI done made some mistakes along the way\nTo become the G I am today\nWho had ever thought I'd make this far?\nOut the hood to be a big star\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere\nHomie I ain't never comin' down\nI'm too high in the clouds\nTo ever have to worry 'bout that\n\n\nBo$$ of the City, Bo$$ of the Coast\nSome other niggaz tried but none of 'em come close\nThey stuck lookin' silly, but nothin' like a loc\nThe Bigg Bow Wow, I kill it with one stroke\n(Wow!) That's what it's about\nThey tryin' to tell a nigga what could come out his mouth\nMotherfucker I'm a G, but first I'm a man\nFreedom of Speech, bitch is a word you can't ban\nSo they blamin' me, sayin' this my talk\nto some women as hoes, like it's my fault\nDamn they lost, man they just don't know\nThat a bitch is a bitch, and a hoe is a hoe\nLet them heaters cock and let them leaders talk\nI'm gon' be smokin' dank, livin' like a boss\nLet them heaters cock and let them leaders talk\nI'ma be smokin' my dank, livin' like a boss, nigga\n\n\nI done made some mistakes along the way\nTo become the G I am today\nWho had ever thought I'd make this far?\nOut the hood to be a big star\nAnd I ain't goin' nowhere\nHomie I ain't never comin' down\nI'm too high in the clouds\nTo ever have to worry 'bout that\n",
