(C-O-O-L)\nwhat\u2019s the spell? (C-O-O-L)\nI might dine in San Francisco\nDance all night in Rome\nI go any freakin\u2019 place I want to\nAnd my lear jet brings me home\nI got ladies by the dozen\nI got money by the ton\nJust aint nobody better\nHeaven knows that I\u2019m the one\nIts all because of something\nThat I didn\u2019t learn in school,\nIm just cool (cool)\nHoney baby cant you see...I\u2019m soo cool (cool)\nAint nobody bad like me\nwhat\u2019s that spell? (C-O-O-L)\nwhat\u2019s that spell? (C-O-O-L)\nand im cool im just cool (cool,cool,cool)\nim just cool im just cool cool cool\nwhen I look into the mirror\ntheres just something I already know\nim just cool(cool)\nHoney baby cant you see...I\u2019m just cool (cool)\nAint nobody bad like me\nSpell it (C-O-O-L)\nWhats that spell? (C-O-O-L) cool\nSing it baby cool\nWhats that spell? (cool)\n",
