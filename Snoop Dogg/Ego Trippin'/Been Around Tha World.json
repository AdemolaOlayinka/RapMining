I been around the track\n\nHop in Peas with the bosses\n300 for the yacht, the third deck got a office\nDocking down in Monaco, churching with my folks\nBad luck had me dying when I fell up out that boat\n\nMy life is like a movie\nBut the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me\nThen I relax and chill\n'Cause without you none of this is real\nBaby you know I\n\nBeen around tha world\nI've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces\nBut baby none of them compares to you\nSoon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone\n\nBeen around tha world\nI've been into many places, seen some unfamiliar faces\nBut baby none of them compares to you\nSoon as I get home I'm racing to unplug my phone\n\nJust for you baby\nYeah, I'm on my way home right now\nI'm on my way right now\nI'm leaving the studio right now\n\nYeah, soon as I get home tomorrow I'ma go unplug it\nMatter of fact I ain't even gonna bring it in the house\nSee you in a minute\n",
