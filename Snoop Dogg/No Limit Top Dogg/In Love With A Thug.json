Check it out\n(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)\n(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)\n\nYeah, gangsta, uh-huh!\nHave you ever had a pretty, young saditty\nBlack female with chips, from the city?\nHer momma got ends, and her daddy got ends\nAnd she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends\nGood girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)\nWhen I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys\nAnd I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)\nCause everytime she came to pick a nigga up\nShit, she'd take a nigga out\nRoll around town, ask the pound, they know, look\nBaby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low\nBought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together\nMan I hope this thang last forever\nWe been together six months, and we ain't argued yet\nShe lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit\nAnd don't say shit when I dip with my click\nAnd understand, when I'm down and out\nmay need some help with some chips\nHer mother approved of me, but her father he don't\nHe probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk\nDaddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world\nBuyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls\nNo matter what her father say, baby gon' see me\nIt's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie\nBelieve me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug\nIn love with a thug\n\n\n\n(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)\nDaddy I'm in love with a gangsta\n(she was in love, with a THUG, in love!)\nMomma I'm in love with a gangsta\n\n\nMm.. I'm caught up in the middle and I don't know what to do\nI caught eight months in the joint, behind my crew\nThat I gotta do and I'ma miss you Boo\nBut I'ma write you every night and call you on the phone too\nWhatchu gon' do? \"You know I'm gon' stay true\nBut I'ma go ahead to college like my father want me to\"\nWell um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind\nAnd I'ma call you back tomorrow round the same time\nI'm on the mainline, 9500 for short\nOn another phoneline, holla'n at my other hoe\nThis bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT\nOld fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH\nI bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap\nNiggaz watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)\nNever caught slippin, always on strap\nAnd now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin getback\nSit back and contemplate, and think about baby\nAnd hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy\nBut while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college\nShe gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge\nCause gangsta-ass niggaz go to school nowadays\nI tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways\nShe fell in love with the local G\nAnd now they both in the penetentiary, she didn't mention me\n",
