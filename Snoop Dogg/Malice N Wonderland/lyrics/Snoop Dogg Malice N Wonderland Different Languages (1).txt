I’m from the East Coast but I’m falling so hot a nigger got me crib walking

try to find you
fill you
revive you
going with your bad self baby cause I do adore
and I give you more

don’t trip I ain't leaving you for
Jake got Beyonce I got Shante

when I bring em out feels so good I had to sing about
get it get it now
we flying out of town checking in the suite
pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down

is it the way you look
is it the way you walk
is it the way you cook
is it the way you talk
I think it's all of the above
no play time in the day time making love
kids go to school
we can act a fool
skinny dip in the pool
do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow queen of the town
hey yo Jaz tell em how I put it down

do your thing
ain't no game
show no shame
if I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
so I got you got 2 1 2
put your face on my back brand new tattoo
20 year in the game what love won't do
a lot of women want me but I want you
you look cute when you smile so I renewed our vows
nowadays I ain't moving that wow
I changed my style it might happen to you
what gotten to me shit I gotten to you
and start raping about things like love and being true
now maybe we could make another baby or two

you make me say 
so good got me speaking different languages
