County nigga\nIf you's a bitch then get yo' ass from 'round here nigga\nBefore they come put bullets in yo' brain\nCause in the hood ain't nothin' really changed\nThey tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam\nAnd just like Sam niggaz just don't give a damn\nThey mission is to leave yo' ass in pain\nCause they don't give a fuck about a thing\nIt's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West\nBetter watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest\nThese niggaz come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit\nYou'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch\nThis shit is a mess..\nYou can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest\nYou can't talk to police 'cause most police ain't gon' stress\nThey get that cheddar like they want it with they foot in your chest\nThey want that paper out here\nEnough to come and take what's on your plate out here\nEnough to have somebody take your place out here\nFuckin' around without your strap sound like a bad idea\n\n\nIt ain't safe to leave the house\nFuck around 'round here\nThese niggaz quick to air ya out\nand lay ya down 'round here\nYou run your mouth niggaz will put ya\nin the ground 'round here\nOne-time don't even fuck around and come 'round here\n",
