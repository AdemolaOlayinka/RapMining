Lewis with Air Force One's on\nI gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams\nRed Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'\nMe and Snoop got the West Coast locked\nRed and blue rag tied in a knot\nWith all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out\n\n\nSo whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot\nCa-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip\nSo whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot\nCa-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip\n\n\nI ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck\nAin't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's\nHopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go\nTil' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4\nWe \"Just Dippin\", one Bloodin' one Crippin'\nI'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen\nMoral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side\nSo if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside\n\n\n(What up Blood?)
