(And what they do?)\nThey twisted fingers say you know who we are...\nHe said: I dont give a fuck I\u2019m Snoop Doggy Dogg ... (Ah huh)\nThey kept fucking and it went too far,\nSo Snoopy he went straight to the trunk of his car (And what he get?),\nhe got his gun and they start running hard,\nhe started firing and then he just charged...\nPLOW!!!\n\n\nRun Nigga, Run Nigga (Plow)\nDuck Nigga, Duck Nigga (Plow)\nRun Motherfucker, Run (Plow)\nRun Motherfucker, Run (Plow)\n\nI didn't mean to hit what I hit\nNow that's 3 motherfuckers dead, and I ain't seen shit\nBut these niggas a scream wit plea but for like a G like me it\u2019s just a case\nBelieve and you can see\nI crack the mac back and pop off rolling\nAnd smack your neck back, you drop off falling\nI haven't seen my mama in a week\nAnd she ain't even ran her mouth about me\nFuck that I ain't give a fuck about the law\nNiggas say they wanna brawl\nYou would think that they wore bra\u2019s\nBelieve in all the things that you never saw\nIn it y\u2019all, been a Dogg, smoke you like a menathol\nYou think you know? But this can't go\nYou think you\u2019ll blow, all my dough?\nWhat the fuck, no\nSee these niggas proceed with speed\nSo feel the need to bleed\nAll you hear my enemies going\n\n\nVato you won't believe what they saw,\nI saw these pack a guys and they act real hard... (And what they do?)\nThey twisted fingers say you know who we are...\nHe said: I dont give a fuck I\u2019m Snoop Doggy Dogg ...
