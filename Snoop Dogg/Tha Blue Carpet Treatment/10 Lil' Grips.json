'cause I got money to get\nAin't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this\nStay focused young homey, that's the code to this\nKeep a strap in ya pocket when ya tip through the towns\nThere's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down\nA lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang\nIf ya money right then you might get you a chain\nBut if ya money is low, there's only one way to go\nJack a rapper at a local rap radio show\nSo mean, so green, crip back to the block\nThen brag to the homies, show 'em what you got\nIt's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)\nAnd they thought we just gangsta rapped\nYeah nigga, we take your snaps\nYour shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)\nIt's like that!\n\n\n\n\nIt's a whole lot of fillin when you on the Eastside\nOn the Eastside, nigga we ride\nAnd it's a whole lot of dealin when you on the Eastside\nOn the Eastside, nigga we ride\nAnd it's a whole lot of stealin when you on the Eastside\nOn the Eastside, nigga we ride\nAnd it's a whole lot of killin when you on the Eastside\nEastside, yeah nigga we ride\n\n\n\n\nThey say it's crazy out here, it ain't no more fun\nI can't walk down the street without my gun, gun\n",
