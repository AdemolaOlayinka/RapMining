(Nobody)\nYou just in it, nigga, I run it\nI gave life to the game and you behind on your bills\nLike I can't get in your grill cause I live in the hills\nSnoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said\nUngrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed\nYoung ass buster, let me see your ID\nI just chunked up a bill passing VIP\nI gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me\nBeen crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do\nSee me walking and that whole world doing it too\nThey play follow the leader, boss on the move\nShot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes\nCotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth\nI brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?\n",
