What you gon do for her?\nWhat you gon do for him? What you gon do for them?\n\nDon't stop keepin it on and on\nWhat do you see?\nSomething like a phenomenon\nBaby what'll it be?\nHey girl\nYea, you know I got that shit\nDon't trip\nIf you ain't bout this shit\nNigga tell em who I am\n\nWhen I was a little baby boy\nMy mama gave me a brand new toy\nTwo turn tables with the mix and I learned to rhyme like a dolomite\nTime went by in a fly creation\nI knew someday I would rock the nation\nSo I made up my mind just what to do\nPut on some gray and blue and made my own crew\nAnd since you dig, your shit on hit and this is how we rock\nI chitty bang my city man and this is for the block\nEquipped to hit, I get you whipped and spit that shit you like\nI'm on like superfly tonight\nCus I don't have no kryptonite\n",
