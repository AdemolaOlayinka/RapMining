Cause if you ain't clown,\nWe from the D-O double G, we groupie true, and slow down\n\nSlow down (slow down now) cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(I can't take the heat, I can't take the heat)\nIt's wicked in these streets\nSlow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Ohhhhhhhhhh, slow down)\nIt's wicked in these streets\n\n\nAyyo Snoop (I used to)\nI used to cook up dope, ride with niggas\nKnow about the hits, hang with killas\nTake the broads down for the jailhouse visits\nKeep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga\nHave the card parties where the stakes was high\nGo shopping hit the club and then ???\nNever had a day without no drama\nHalf the OG's age, but they call me Mama\nHad the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag\nOrange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad\nI never thought about my life I swear y'all, for real\nUntil my best friend Jill got killed and then I\nDropped to my knees and called to the Lord\nPlease change my ways cause I'm living too hard\nAnd too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child\nWhen I'm out here buck wild, damn, I had to slow down\n\nSlow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Slow down baby)\nIt's wicked in these streets (Slow down baby)\nSlow down, cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(Slow down, slow down)\nIt's wicked in these streets\n\n\nYeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut\nAnd started putting all this game on records for my come up\nFrom sun up to sun down, I'm trying to get my money\nHata's ain't gon' stop me cause hatas can't run me\nIt's funny when a bitch was livin' foul\nEvery body seemed glad, but now they ?????\nCause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free\nAnd Feds can't take shit from me, so slow down\nSnoop:\nI got niggas shot niggas drop niggas for fun\nI ????? from these shoulders, I don't need no gun\nBut it's the nineties, and niggas don't bump by the end of the round\nThe clown bound to dump, young chump\nYou don't wanna get caught up in my mix\nCause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch\nWe don't neva eva, talk no shit\nUnless we mack that shit up, nigga you get lit\n\nSlow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas\nSlow down (slow down), cause I can't take the heat, slow down\n(I can't take the heat)\nIt's wicked in these streets (It's wicked in the street)\nSlow down, (I can't take the heat no more) cause I can't take the heat\nSlow down (I can't take it) it's wicked in these streets\nSlow down (slow down) cause I can't take the heat\n(Slow down) Slow down\nSlow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas\nSlow down slow down\nSlow your roll tuck your heat and watch the hatas\n",
