    "lyrics": "Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit\nCheck this out\n\n\nNigga 20 dollars to my name\nDeep in this dice game\nI dust off my knees\nI fucked off two g's\nNothing left to do, but buy some shells for my glock\nWhy? so I can rob every known dope spot\nI'm having hard times, grit, and grind\nShit I'm tyring to get mine\nAin't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline\nIt's a cold twist the way that shit goes\nGotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo\nAnd keep a down bitch for when your money run out\nAnd get you gun out\nAnd shoot'em up till they come out\nI'm blowing in the wind\nIt feels good my friend\nSilkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in\nI'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc\nA drug dealer at the same time i love to smoke\nBut if I wasn't in this rap game\nWould a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to his name\n\n\nNow 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs\nAnd the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs\nIf my yale don't sell how shall we proceed\nBecause we can't slang the urb, cause we smoke too much weed repeat\n\n\nI got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?\nWith this automatic rocket\nGotta have it to pop it,unlock it, and take me up a hostage\nLet'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch\nExtended glock clips allow me to cop chips\nErasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this\nCold blooded killing for ??? this\nSoda couldn't rock this\nchop a shelf when i drop this\nMy ??? can't chop this\nThe hunger that I hold\nSetting here wondering should I take it from his soul\nSee this here with a hole\nAllowed that silencer to blow\nAnd took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before\n\n\nNow with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja\nBecause that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober\nI seen my nigga nigga from way way back\nMe and him used to jack and rock a rental cadillac\nHe sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin\nHe sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin\nAnd I'm bossin, and tossin'em up at the same time\nSo if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???\nAnd why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got\nAnd my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being\nshot\n\n\n\n\nNow look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels goo to be on the outside\nI had 120 dollars, but i spent a 100 on my ride\nNow the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name\nNigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine\nI told him weed charge it 2 the game\nNigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit\nSome slum shit\nSome out the projects dumb shit\nsome weed and blunt shit\nSome I don't give a fuck shit, where it from shit\nSome penitentiary solitary confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun\nshit\nNow I got 20 dollars to my motherfuckin' name, and I gotta get more\nSo I tell nigga hit the floor I'm about to pull a motherfuckin' kick\ndoor\nNow whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting\nY'all call me down??? do get scared I ain't flipped till my guns smoking\nIt be a hustle just to eat\nAnd it be hard on these streets\nGotta get my hustle on\nGot 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long picture this\n",
