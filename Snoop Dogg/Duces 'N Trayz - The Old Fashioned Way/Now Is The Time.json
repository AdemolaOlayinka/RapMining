You know aint nothin different on mines\nWhen I hit up motherfuckers with that look in my eyes\nIt's a statement that I'm makin and aint takin no backtalk\nI'm blowin niggaz hats off as soon as my gat cough\nThe last thought you rappin niggaz should think\nIs you can never get a scratch with Tray Deee on the beat\nOn the streets over beef you dont compete with uno - you know\nThe general a criminal do low\nAdmit cuz I'm wit it then I spit it and lit it\nNiggaz timid in my vision I cause tension and thinkin\nBy my presence I'm a answer to society's hate\nA true rider with the mind - I pushed him outta his way\nFools petty and they ready steady comin with bullshit\nA full clip with jewell will hit like a mule kick\nA sure hit is all I'm aiming for when I blast\nMotherfuckers hit the deck once I go in the dash\n\n\nNow is the time\nThis is the place\nTo bang back the khakis with the church fat lace\nWest is the coast, east is the side\nLong Beach is the city where them gangstas ride\nMoney brings power, power brings respect\nDisrespect the set I gotsta grab the tech\nThis is how it goes and thats how it's done\nEastside 2-1 in the land of the fun\n\n\nNiggaz how ya figure that the game gon' wait\nI came home straight from the pen to take your place\nAint no chase this paper comin soon as I post up\nAnd watch the victom's clock and catch him choppin his dough up\nFuck the his host up stripped, gagged and roped up\nTake the whole cut and he be sure negotiative\nI'm ruthless I shoot crips and bloods alike\nThug for life - come and catch the slug tonight\nInsane mental frame feel no shame or pitty\nSince the game is shitty I gotsta bang the city\nTrippin gangstas so I brang the terroristical heat\nGrab strap jacket mack to reach the tinted to peep\nThis is the beach now any nigga got a rebuttal\nKobe eatin what he speakin once he cant get the muzzle\nStruggle hard for my title and intend to hold it\nYou want it? Then all invitations open\n\n\n\n\nI take seven old B's put 'em in the street\nThen thats seven more busta's who claim they got heat\nAnd then it takes seven more C's before I start to reach\nThen thats 2-1 for the set now lets stretch out in the streets\nTray Deee never do it easy fool so dont expect it\nNiggas get checked and they sets disrespected\nNo question I'm all you ever thought that you was\nTill you ran across the boss and now you coughin up blood\nShoot first fools curse before they kick up dust\nClip gon' bust then they gonna have to pick loc up\nAll they talkin cause I'm chalkin whole districts off\nSince this loss a purple nigga's piss me off\nConflict with my clique get your bitch ass touched\nAll my comrads bomb back it's as sick as fuck\n2-1 till I'm done never run from the turf\nCheck the badge boy we mash on run get it even worse\n\n\n\n\n\n{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}\n{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}\n{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}\n{They say Tray Deee is a ragy baby - he's way too crazy}\n",
