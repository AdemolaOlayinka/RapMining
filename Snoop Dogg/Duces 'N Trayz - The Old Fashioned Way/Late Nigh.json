I'm a real playa\nReal hustler.. real gangsta\nI'm bout getting this money (late night)\nI don't give a fuck what time it is..\nIt can go down all night..\n\n\nButton up the honcho, grab the brownies and heat\nFirst step, to collect a nigga's bread and meat\nThe squares asleep\nBut all the hogs out on the prowl\nBlocks get locked down like they off a child\nTime to eat up off the streets full of fiends and hypes\nChecking cream off ecstasy to the green and white\nDub sacks, the drugs packed up in kilo bricks\nGetcha slang on, bang on, and keep yo chips\nBaller had this, cause the savage beast did need to floss\nSo the hard, Bogard, and we squeezed it soft\nLate night, the game tight, went up a notch or two\nWith fake vice, playin nice, steady watching you\nImpossible, the clock when you.. ain't overtiming\nThe vivrant ways for crimes on the grind and start shining\n9 to 5 is midnight to sunrising\nOccupation gangsta committed to thug life\n\n\nOn a late night..\nThat's the time we gone ride\nNigga, it's do or die\nLate night\nWe ain't checking for names\nWhen the hollow points fly\nOn a late night..\nDeeper and deeper\nWe had to get into some gangsta shit\nLate night\nDeeper and deeper\nThey don't know who they fucking wit\n\n\nDead bodies with a funky smell\nThrow 'em in the ocean\nJack the fo' up two times\nAnd young nigga, keep coastin'\nTurn on the DVD and watch myself on TV\nIt's killings after killings but they don't know it's me\nIt's lil' G, now what you think that stand fo?\nI'm gangsta on the streets and I keep it Crippin' in the studio\nWho else be up late night ready to jack like the whole house?\nGallop in yo shit like the black joust\nTo make it real simple and quick\nIf I don't have it, I gots to take yo shit\nAnd it's all about the fast lane, nigga\nWhen you see me on the streets, I got my finger on tha trigga\nNever catch who's slippin' when I'm on them 2-wing deez\nAnd when I get my bricks, I flood ya whole city in titties\nPlease believe, that I'm a lil' crazy motherfucker\nTurned out by the Spillman's, Gaithen's, and Ruckas\n\n\nOn a late night..\nThat's the time that we gone move a gang away\nLate night\nThey call me Chef Boyardee, pushin' up some cakes\nOn a late night..\nDeeper and deeper\nI bang these streets for all so long\nLate night\nDeeper and deeper\nUh, wit this game that I got, I can't go wrong\n",
