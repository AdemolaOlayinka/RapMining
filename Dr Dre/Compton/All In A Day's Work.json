    "lyrics": "Fear, fear's a powerful thing. I mean it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just... go in\n\nSittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?\nAnd I'm just lookin' at it all\nI'll be right here in Los Angeles\nLookin' like a villain layin' low\nNothin' I can do but pack it all up\nGoin' up, but shit, I feel the love\nSpotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight\nActin' a fool and feelin' alive\nI'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault\nOnly type of livin' I know\n\nSee if it was you you would've killed yourself by now\nIt takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this\nAnd they ask me how I do it\nMothafucka just take a look around\nBest believe I'm in the buildin' I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that but uh\nNo, no don't mention me at all\nYeah comin' live and direct\nAnd I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh\nWatch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'\nI thought it was all good\nBut now you mothafuckas crossed the line\nKinda pissin' me off\nAll the fans and all the fame, and though I gave everything to this game\nThey still complain\nNow what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?\nThere's so much fuckin' pressure\nThere's all this pressure\nAnd it's all in a day's work\n\nWork, hard\nWorkin' so hard\n24/7, 3-6-5\n365, hard work\nIt's all in a day's work\n\nMy whole life all I ever thought about was grindin'\nEven though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence\nThat was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylus\nAnd that was back when I felt like rappers was true mothafuckin' riders\nOr even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster\nShit I was still sayin', \"Fuck the police\"\nBorn and raised in the belly of the beast\nI had a dream that we was at peace\nBut I was so wrong.. so wrong\nY'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias\nNow reality TV talks about pulpits and choirs\nSome of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us\nIt's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton sick and tired\nSome of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate\nThese bitches thinkin' fame first\nI can't knock the hustle, it's all in a day's work\nBut that's that shit with potential to make the game worse\nShit it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse\nThey just thirst\n\nHard times\nI'm on my grind, fuck the part-time\nStay ready for war, I'm on the front line\nI'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine\nIt's becoming the only feeling I know\nOnly type of livin' I know\nOnly type of livin' I know\nOnly type of livin' I know\nOnly type of livin' I know\nGonna go to work\nWe gotta work\nWe gotta work\nLet's get back to work\nOn the grind, back to work\n\nLet's work\nRich as fuck, but, guess what, I'm back to work\nOverseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work\nSo many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work\nSome of my friends don't understand I got to work\nAlways talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, \"Fuck that I gotta work\"\nIf you really wanna do it like this, shit you better get back to work\nBack to work\nRight back to work\nGotta get back to work\nShit, right back to work\n",
