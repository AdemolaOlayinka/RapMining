Sorry\nLooking at these hoes and they gold digger gorgeous tryna get me\nI run game on a bitch, one Mississippi two Mississippi\nFlint nigga in the spot til they pop one and the cops come like (woo!)\nMotherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah\nStill a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga til I'm gone\nDo it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on\nFuck that shit nigga, fuck that shit go\nLive for my hood, look this for my block\nRide for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac\nI ain't got shit but I still feel good\nNigga can't take what a nigga don't got\nGo hard in the paint, you can tell em post up\nHomie in the hood like \"let me hold something\"\nYour mans in the hood talking all that shit\nWhen they ran up on him lil buddy froze up\nAll they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing\nNiggas be talking that ain't what they want\nAin't no fake shit around here\nCause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck\nI be killing this and not giving a fuck\nYou laugh at a bitch, she get hid in the trunk\nYou think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up\nSo this for my people that's still in the cut\n\nI said I want that, need that\nThe root of all evil mayne, (get it, get it)\nI said I want that, need that\nThe root of all evil, mayne\n\nSaid what's up to the nigga wearing all black at a white party\nAnd I'm looking like I don't give a fuck\nThat's how I get down nigga sorry\nAnd I'm looking like I don't play no games, nah, nigga don't try me\nBeen that nigga that's been spitting that\nPaid dues like a motherfucking hobby\nIf you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me\nI came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit\nAnd that's why we on top of this motherfucking world\nDamn, look at that body\nShe come along with the territories\nTurn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story\n(Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you)\nGot a relationship with that money\n(But that bitch will never be faithful to you)\nEven though I know she knows she crazy\n(Please just let it go, seize, no saving you)\nRide, ride\nTil the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch\n(We can do it for the love)\nBut I'm never stopping my poppin'\n(These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial\nIt's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)\n\nWant that, need that\nRoot of all evil, mayne\nI said I want that, need that\nRoot of all evil, mayne\n\nIt's beautiful outside\nLooks like it's raining money, mayne\nIt's beautiful outside\nLooks like it's raining money, mayne\n\nWant that, need that\nThe root of all evil mayne, get it, get it\nI said I want that, need that\n",
