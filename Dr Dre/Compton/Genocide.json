What it look like?\nSee my daddy done kill 'em dead\nBullets come down from the earth\nMy daddy done killa you\nDon't feel a pull a part that man and\n(Let me up!) What it look?\n\nStone cold killers in these Compton streets\nOne hand on the 9, all eyes on me\nMurder, murder\nMurder, murder\nCall 9-1-1, emergency\nHands up in the air for the world to see\nIt's murder, it's murder\nMurder, murder\nMurder\n\n(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)\nMurderess, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin'\nTinted windows ride at your wifey (Blah!) and I bet you miss her\nReload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays\nThat's one on the left and one in the right hand, Scottie Pippen both ways\nBeen doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timelined\nLookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high\nI'm talkin' about that bottom where it's hot grinds\nShit, I\u2019m just tryna get paid and keep \u2018em thighs high\nSometimes I feel like I could just bury \u2018em, bury 'em\nCause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area\nI'm very aware that hip hop needed somethin' to carry it\nSo I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot\nHangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier\nThis is hub city nigga, don't make us embarrass you\nMan, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic\nWe did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic\n\nStone cold killers in these Compton streets\nOne hand on the 9, all eyes on me\nMurder, murder\nMurder, murder\nCall 9-1-1, emergency\nHands up in the air for the world to see\nIt's murder, it's murder\nMurder, murder\nMurder\n\nAhh, recognize whatever side the sides reside until the dead has risen\nLive in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings\nI ride, I'mma ride in a stolen jeep\nRide with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)\nMama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)\nMy family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (abducted)\nMy aliens on surveillance, they payed me a visit (Disgusting)\nOur stadium's packed, raiders in black\nCurls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap\nI lie on the side of a one way street\nNowhere to go, death all I can see\nI say \"Fuck is up?\", I fuck 'em up, your supper's up or somethings up\nI hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke\nPlenty ruckus with the weapon I protect it under oath\nMy discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life\nFuck your hope, fuck your mama\nFuck your daddy, fuck you dead homie\nFuck the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!\nMurder, murder\nMurder\nMurder\nIt's all murder\nMurder\nMurder, murder\nMurder, murder\nIt's been a murder\n(It's been a 187 in this bitch!)\n",
