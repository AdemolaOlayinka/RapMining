Let me show you what this chronic like\"\nCouldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life\nAnd then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in (woo!)\nThis one of those dreams you don't wake up from\nThen again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from\nWhen the sun shines and they bust nines\nDon't dial 9 plus 1-1\nWhen they run up on your school bus with a two truck, you might learn something\n\nAnd it all falls back on me\nSometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me\n(Somehow it always fall back on me)\nNo matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me\nIf it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be\n",
