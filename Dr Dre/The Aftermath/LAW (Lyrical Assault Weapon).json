One time for your mind, y'knowI'msayin?\nYo, from upstate to Brooklyn, the whole borough's thorough\nYou know the time, y'knowI'msayin?\nCrown Heights, to all my niggas holdin it down\nIt's hardcore, B-boy rhymes just for you, y'knowI'msayin?\n(L-A-W, this might trouble you) This is Sharief, y'knowI'msayin?\nPuttin it down for the Aftermath like this\n\n\n\nAs I inhale the blunt and take a sip off the yac\nMy rhymes come to life, my verbal forces attack\nCan't hold me back, I'm too strong, I waited too long\nFreestyle a whole rap tape then write a new song\nBeen in the game since...what? That shit is past tense\nPass the microphone and watch this nigga crack the C\nwith that ill shit, I came to kill shit\nI crack the code, must be the reason they reveal shit\nBut in this era of mayhem\nI recyc' the murderous rhymes to slay them\nTo all my opponents who wanna kick it, I spark\nthe verbal scientist in your title, I'm walkin wit it\nA hundred dime pieces and the party got the heaters\nI shine my verbal styles and got niggas climbin on speakers, the thrill\nseekers\nAn earthquake of bass lines swangin the party, I'm slangin the mic\nlike a syllable shotty, sippin 40's\n\n\n\nCheck it out y'all, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the B-boys and all the B-gals\nCheck it out now, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the B-boys and all the B-gals\n\n\n\nBona fide B-boy, biceps' bionic\nBlast em back, okay let's get it started\nOriginal rap styles comin from my shooter\nFifty niggas deep, I'm the ill kid recruiter\nPeople gather round, check my flow\nlisten too, look take a peek, time for thought then you know\n(What they know?)\nI build with skill, fulfill the drill and still then kill\nYou couldn't stop the pain with Benadryl\nToo many claim unnamed for fame\nor be soft as baby tissue with no gun to aim\nI take a raptor's rough cuz I'lla date the semen\nSpectators be sayin they can't go where he went\nThat's another level of attack (haa), bring your bats\nMy DJ scratch the record like a scrotum sack\nI slice the rapper like a surgeon\nIf he wanna battle, I play him out like a priest in a turban\nToo much tenacity, vocal capacity\nYa better take some notes, don't try to get on after me\nCuz I'm the chemical enemical\nRhymes I say are definitely guaranteed to reach the pinnacle\n\n\n\nCheck it out y'all, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the real players and all the fly girls\nCheck it out now, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the real players and all the fly girls\n\n\n\nFeelin the metronome click, my microphone's on\nIt's time to kiss Sharief to perform\nYa lukewarm, my degrees be uncharted in the centre of fight square\nI rum brass knuckle rhymes fuckin with crimes\nI'm natural as loaded dice, understand\nwhere no man survives, L.A.W. can\nTransform, I see it ain't even worth ya triggers\nI'm from the days when B-boys were straight earthin niggas\nStandin my arms crossed, toss a grenade\nrein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade\nYou better cuz your dome piece blown\nRelease chrome beats, nuclear missiles rhymes under my comb\nThree strikes marks the villian bustin rhymes\nlike shots in Sarajevo Saturday night blood be spillin\nSome I slaughter such as *?two compel?* blows\nCrush your corny kids caught stumblin on my shells, so\nsick, too quick, I stab you with some shit\nDoin infinite assault these hard lyrics I commit\nWhen I crush your lungs, I keep my pace uptempo\nSwingin my prison rhymes, fuckin mics like a nympho\n\n\n\nCheck it out y'all, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the real hustlas across the world\nCheck it out now, L-A-W's raw\nL.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon\nL-A-W, this might trouble you\nFor all the real hustlas across the world\n",
