The Aftermath
1996)
I've told you over and over again
Knew that wasn't what I stood for
But you didn't have what I wanted
Now you do, bitch do me
Hmm, kind of sad and now I'm gone
Thought you'd never see me again
But here I stand again, right before your eyes
To your surprise
Baby we can talk it over, baby we can
But I'd love to try (I bet you will)
Yes I will baby, please
Seriously (She said) in all honesty
I love you baby hmm hmm
And I always will (I bet you will)

Pleeease come back to me
Get down on your knees
And beg me please
Pleeease (Oh yeah) come back to me
Ain't no thing I know you would
Cause I bet you couldn't cause your mind is slow (Hey)
And now your waiting for your high, liquid smoke
(But it ain't gonna work) so let it drop
So let em' fall and let me have another

(In the middle of nowhere I'm standing all alone)
(You're alone baby, oh)
Ooh please, ooh please, ooh please
Ooh please, ooh please baby
Please come back to me (Lord knows)
I'll give you anything you want
Take my body, mind and, and heart
It's all your's baby
(I don't need you and I sure don't wanna see you)
(Baby oh no)

Pleeease come back to me
Get down on your knees
And beg me please

And beg me please
Pleeease come back to me
Said you treated me wrong
That's why you're all alone
Pleeease come back to me

Got you begging please (I got you begging please)
You know you did me wrong
But you know I got what you need
You wanna be in my life
Thought that I'd make you my wife (You wanna be my wife baby)
But I'm quitting your ass baby cause you cheated
With my best friend

Won't you please
