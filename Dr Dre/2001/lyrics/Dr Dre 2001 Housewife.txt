Now this this is one of them occasions
where the homies not doin it right
I mean he found him a hoe that he like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
a bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what you found you a hoe that you like
But you can't make a hoe a housewife (wife) 


I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin strong, but comin home, to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin Spanish
I'm mannish - get yo' nails out my back
Slut I'm bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat
Learn the player rules, this is how I play a dude
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick huh, got her turnin tricks huh
Man it's a trip I don't trip I'm in yo' Lexus flexin
I left her up in Dallas, Texas - assed-out 




Naw hoe is short for honey, almost had her Wailin like Bunny
Tellin tales of bein pregnant, catchin Norstrom sales with abortion money
I spotted her, seen her with my nigga when I shot at her
Now we got beef, he caught up in the hoe's erotica
Exotic - she's psychotic, rockin his Nautica
Soon he'll need antibiotics (sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, "Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?"
Fool I pity ya
We live in the city off, ballers
with more bouncin than a Zapp, she will doo-wah-diddy-ya
Prettier to grittier, the wittier can get her
to the Hotel, Niko, on some Sauve shit like, Rico
That's when I caught a Vision like Coleco
A high-post hoe, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico 


At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn (say what nigga?)
I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggaz need to stop fuckin with O.J.
Some niggaz bang blood, some niggaz bang crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
if you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The hoe started callin when I started boss ballin
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
Hoes eat dick like eggs and steak
That ain't shit new, I thought you knew (what?)
I knew you would, you wish you could
break a G down, break me down
But I'ma see you on the rebound (what what?) D.P. style 






Lil' 1/2 Dead 


Lil' 1/2 Dead the money jumped out to say
ol' Snoop Dogg on the look out boy? 


Yeahhh 


He gotta be MORE than 1/2 Dead
if he don't fill my motherfuckin drink up! 


Or fill your motherfuckin mouth up 


Ahhhhhh-HAHAhahahahAHAHH 


I don't think so!!
