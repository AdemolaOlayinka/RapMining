I'm only half the man that I was\nI'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you\nYou knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect\nyou coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him\nHe can take the game with him, cause he defines the word\nThe one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?\nI'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why\nCryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it\nWe fought like brothers, somethin we never should do\nWe coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth\nHe had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow\nDon't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go\n\n\nListen listen listen.. (listen) whoahh (listen)\nListen listen listen.. (better listen) whoahh-oahhh-oahhh\nListen listen listen..\nListen.. mmm-mmm-mmm\n\n\nIf you wanna know why.. (why I live my life)\nThe way that I do.. (cause I got to get this money)\nSo don't worry about me.. (cause I know my way around)\nI'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper\n\n\nYouse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there\nMet up with homies from the street, and got deep up there\nIf you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew\nI thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you\nWe lost a thug, a son, and a father\nI spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him\nThe Lord must be accidentally pulling your file\ncause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial\nPrayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt\nYou either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it\nI done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face\nto straight breakin down and showin all emotions\nI'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry\nIf that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta\nIt's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you\nI miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you\n\n\nListen listen listen.. (listen) whoahh (listen)\nListen listen listen.. whoahh-oahhh-oahhh\nListen listen listen..\nListen.. eyy-eyy-eyy-yeah-yeahh\n\n\nIf you wanna know why.. (why I live my life)\nThe way that I do.. (cause I got to get this money)\nSo don't worry about me.. (don't worry, don't worry worry)\nI'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper\n\n\nyeah, yeah, ahhh-oooh-oahahahhhhh.. listen..\nmmmmmmmmmhmhmhmmmmmm..\nif you don't know why I.. you gotta listen up right now\nlis-ten, lis-ten, lis-ten, lis-ten..\noooooooooh... oahahoooohhh ooooha ohhhhh\nlis-ten, lis-ten\nahhhowooooo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah\nyeah-ehh-yeah, yeah-ooeooooh\nyahhooooohahhooooh listen\nlis-ten, children lis-ten\nI'm tryin to tell you somethin good\nDon't get caught up in the hood\nYeahhh-hah, yeahhh-hah, aooooooh\nif you don't know why..\nyou gotta find out the reason why..\nbrother.. brother..\n",
