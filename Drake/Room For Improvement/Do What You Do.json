    "lyrics": "Stance on lean, leg up on the wall\nMy people they chill, why you haters wanna ball\nI'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all\nYou waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall\nBut uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do\nDo's what you do, I do what I do\n\nGetting down tonight if they say you cuttin'\nA lot of rappers in my city, they ain't saying nothin'\nA lot of records from here they get no play\nAnd these labels don't give advances so you get no pay\nThem little rims on the ride, I'mma let those stay\nSo these nosy niggas won't know that I get checks all day\n'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying on guessing\nMy record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it\nBoi-1da and Drake if there's beef I address it\nAnd the black Phantom is here soon as we find our exit\nBoth of the deals, nothing under a mill\nWe know you got it to give and we trying to collect it\nLong as I got me some heat through the winter\nDrake known as a pro, I'mma teach you beginners\nBout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer\nFor features ya'll better get me while its cheaper than dinner\nCause me and 1da trying to get at your girl\nIf you see her tell this nigga got some beats I'mma sell her\n\n\nCheck, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it\nYou hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it\nSo now you at the store for some blank CDs\nYou can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it\nCause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you\nAnd I'll be the only one she concerned with\nTo the people that ignored me before this\nThis one is for you as a song re-recorded\nFunny thing is, you just notice me now\nBut I was here along your vision's just been distorted\nI'm so throwed, and I write a sixteen and record it\nThe waiting is over I think music need it\nDrake cuttin his records without gettin weeded\nPeople in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude\nThey expectations I'mma exceed it\nLike a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it\nWhen it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead shit\nFinally here I'mma star with the timing\nMy swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining\nThis for anybody that's searchin for cash\nAnd purchase so fast, you only get the dough when you grindin\nAnd so I grind like I'm listening to all Wayne\nMy pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy\n\n\nTwo years ago, a friend of mine\nAsked me to kick some new school lines\nAnd so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death\nNow not signing me is something that the rest regret\nThen I, hopped inside the Cadillac\nThe chauffeur drove off and we never came back\n",
