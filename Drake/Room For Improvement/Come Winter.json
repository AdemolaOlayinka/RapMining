    "lyrics": "yeah, this dedicated to canada man\nthe whole up north\na lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the winter\nbut listen...\n\ni met this new girl late june or early july\ni called her a bunch of times but she barely replied\nnow it's december, i'm driving, and she's like where's my hi?\ni swear, that i never called you cause i really get shy\nsee that was a segue, i believe the matter\nis what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter\nwhere the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\ndrugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up\nwhere girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in\nthe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nand some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\nand if you planning family vacations you better know when\nbut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\ninstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\ncause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nwhere cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\n\nyeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\na lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\nbut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\n\nforget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nshe lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet\nsince i'm driving, i ask her how to get the suite\nshe doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nshe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nshe's bold but i roll with it, i'm impressed cause she's sweet\nthen she says \"i heard your song and i'm obsessed with the beat,\ni mean, the lyrics are good, but i'm obsessed with the beat\ni love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good,\nthere's a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat\"\noff this i'm kinda takin it back for a second,\ni get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nand so i do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nuntil we end up sexin and now my heart attached\ni'm thinkin off i should've been more southern\nand realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho!\n\nyeah, uh, i told ya'll i had a story for you right\nuh, ya man, it's what it is\n\nand now, i'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench\nshe love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench\nbut, my boy say i'm actin different, because i lay downtown\nand i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nshe tellin everyone imma hold here down\ntell everyone i'm the prince up in this cold clear town\nand stupid me i just listen to her,\ninstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round\nbut then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch\nthe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nwhen we were together it seeming like way back when\nball players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nsee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\ninstead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna\nand it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\ni guess, i lost another one to the wintertime\n\ni miss you, most of aaaallll, myy daarling\n(gimme a second to gather my toughts)\nstrolling in the park (ho!)\nand watching winter turn to spriing (such a beautiful day man)\n(yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\nstrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing\n(i'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\n(man, but i got something to else to tell ya baby)\n\ni remember them encore pms, breakfast and the wake up\nnow drake's committed we waiting on the breakup\nso we can get back to them cognac nights\nwith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\nand i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nthe winter came and blew his cold air through\nback then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her,\nby the end of the week i would know that crew\nand we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nwith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nat the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin\nwe had ladie's hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nbut this summer is different it's a two man operation\ngranted the fact that we one man short\ngot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\ncause handin' them crack is a one man sport\ninstead of dress-up, i walk in sweat pants and chomp clinkin'\ni find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\nthe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\ni'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\ncause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside\nwe'll never talk again, scary and true\nthat song special i recorded with voyce well it's like a classified\nit's what i'm lookin for to carry me through\nyet i can't seem to find a heavy girl that possesses it\nonly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nand when they talk about they past and lovers\nand you get mad at the though of it giving ass to others\nyet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride\nthere's also room for improvement as soon as june arrive\n\nstrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing\nstrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing\nstrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing\n",
