Baby she's over.\nI've decided to give you all of me.\nBaby come closer, baby come closer.\nI'm ready for ya!\nKill 'em all, switch it up.\nPut it on, zip it up.\nLet my perfume, soak into your sweater.\nSay you'll be here soon, sooner the better.\nNo option for her, you sayin' no.\nI run this game, just play your role.\nFollow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?\nThought it over and decided tonight is the night.\n\nYeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.\nGot my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI'm in control, but with you bein' the man,\nYou don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nSo keep thinkin' you the man,\n'Cause it's all part of my plan.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nNothin' on, I strut around.\nI do it big, I shut it down.\nI wonder if you'll be able to handle me.\nMental picture, no cameras please.\n\nYeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.\nGot my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI'm in control, but with you bein' the man,\nYou don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nSo keep thinkin' you the man,\n'Cause it's all part of my plan.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\n\nUh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,\nFlash, black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast,\nI know you get impatient as the time pass\nYou say you want it fast... define fast\n'Cause I can speed it up, and make it last\nAnd I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast\nAnd I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past,\nAnd make damn sure you never forget it\nCommitted\nI'm ready, I'm with it... still here like a statue\nPink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,\nYou say you got baggage, well I'm packed too\nPlus I got a sex pistol, pointed right at you \"BANG!\"\nThe baddest women ever and the hardest out,\nProven over and over again that's why I'm hard to doubt\nPlus I'm Young Money 'till the death, I took the carter route\nI'm more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about\n\nYeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter.\nGot my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI'm in control, but with you bein' the man,\nYou don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nSo keep thinkin' you the man,\n'Cause it's all part of my plan.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nR.I.P to the girl\nwho used to see\nher days are over\nbaby shes over\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nI-I-I'm ready for ya.\nso keep thinkin you the man\ncause its all part of my plan\n",
