Man you know you know,\nYeah and you should let them boys know too,\nShow them n-ggas every single thing I showed you,\nIm here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin I'm the man (big mike), so true,\nYeah but what does it take to feel secure?\nA place with wooden floors and space to put awards,\nA couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,\nThe cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,\nWell I got it, I got it,\nI wonder if id be happy without it, I doubt it,\nI try not to really think about it,\nI made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted til I'm outted,\nGame top bitch, I hope youre proud of us,\nKing james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,\nThis old g got my whole suite cloudin up,\nBut I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck,\nThey aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,\nIm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,\nI really hate to say I told you so,\nSo I bite my tongue but you know you know,\n\n\nUhh, please make your long story shorter,\nThis time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,\nNumbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters,\nI just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border,\nYeah so you can spare me all the accolades,\nIm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,\nHalf a million dollars later and my taxes paid,\nAnd I'm still spendin money from my actin days,\nDamn, life is such a lovely thing,\nFeel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,\nTell your girlfriend that I can pull some f-ckin strings,\nSo were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,\nYeah, I bet I be there I be there,\nYou see that '62 sittin outside? Thats me there,\nIm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,\nPutting in that overtime I never said it be fair,\nIm always left wishin I could have done it in person,\nMy apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin,\nI got new girls but none of they love is for certain,\nAnd call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,\nDamn what happened to us?\nLife can always change, you have to adjust,\nHow come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?\nIf it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,\nEspecially when I come flyin through the door\nAnd kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,\nWhy has every woman never dined her before?\nAm I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?\nThe Rothschild's, the Cru's, the 'Caias and the Opuses\nIts always nice when youre out with someone that notices,\nMy condo got that art gallery openness,\nIm just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is,\nThey aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,\nIm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,\nI really hate to say I told you so,\nSo I bite my tongue but you know you know\n",
