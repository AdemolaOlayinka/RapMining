I'm with Marley G bro\nFlyin Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows\nAnd I wanna tell you somethin that you prolly should know\nThis that (Slumdog Millionaire) Bollywood flow\nAnd uhhh, my real friends never hearin from me\nFake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me\nThat's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused\nI got a small circle, I'm not with different crews\nWe walk the same path, but got on different shoes\nLive in the same buildin, but we got different views\nI got a couple cars, I never get to use\nDon't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos\nAnd these days all the girls is down to roll\nI hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole\nPlus I been sippin so this shit is movin kinda slow\nJust tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go\n\n\nNow tell me how you love it\nYou know you at the top when only heaven's right above it\nWe onnnn, it's Young Money motherfucker\nIf you ain't runnin wit it run from it motherfucker\nAll right, now somebody show some money in this bitch\nAnd I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch\nYa diiiig? I got my gun in my boo purse\nAnd I don't bust back because I shoot firrrrrst\n\n\nMeet me on the fresh train\nYes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names\nAnd all of my riders do not give a fuck, X Games\nGuns turn you boys into pussies, sex chaaaange\nAnd I smoke 'til I got chest pains\nAnd you niggaz know I rep my gang like Jesse James\nWomen are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne\nI been fly so long I fell asleep on the fuckin plaaaane\nSkinny pants and some Vans\nCall me Triple A, get my advance in advance - amen\nAs the world spin and dance in my hands\nLife is a beach, I'm just playin in the saaaand\nUhh, wake up and smell the pussy\nYou niggaz can't see me, but never overlook me\nI'm on the paper trail, it ain't no tellin where it took me\nYeah, and I ain't a killa but don't push meeeee\n\n\n\n\nUhh, how do he say what's never said?\nBeautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red\nLimpin off tour cause I made more off my second leg\nMuh'fuckin Birdman Junior, 11th grade\nBall on automatic start\nI could hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw\nWildcat offense, check the paw prints\nWe in the building, you niggaz in apartments\nUhh, n-now c'mon be my blood donor\nFlo' so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her\nDo it big and let the small fall under that\nDamn, where you stumbled at? From where they make gumbo at?\nKane got the fuckin beat jumpin like a jumpin jack\nBut you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack\nHip-Hop, I'm the heart of that, nigga nothin short of that\nPresident Carter, Young Money Democrat, uhh\n\n\n\n\nYeah! We onnnn\nYoung Mu', Young Mula baby!\n",
