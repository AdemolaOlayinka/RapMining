Don't judge me man\nThey tend to say that us rappers are materialistic\nThey say we lack substance\nMe, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though\n\nUh, we know what you're thinking love\nYou think we out smoking and drinking love\nPushing big whips, chains clinking love\nBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me\nWe know how you speculate\nThinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date\nClaim we're early and be showing up extra late love\nBut y'all don't really know me like you think you know me\n\nUh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice\nFor that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice\nHaters tell you all the rumors they heard\nAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice\nMy groove theory is that when you too cheery\nThey try to bring you down to the level they at\nWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky\nThat's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap\nBut, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl\nNah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl\nHaha, I can't lie, you probably right about it\nAnd if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it\nBut I hate it when they judge me on how I sound\nI mean I spit that influential shit from my town\nI don't know why you sitting on the couch\nWhen you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down\nYou think taking your purse off\nWill lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off\nAt least I got status because I could've been a local emcee\nAnd you probably would've been worse off\nSo I'm a take this hat off, and I'm a hit it till I backs off\nAnd then I'm back sorrowful\nCause you thinking you can predict what happen\nYou the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping\n\n\nYou probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and\nSwang dick to these hoes like nunchucks\nWell, you can think what you want but\nI think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut\nYou need to get real and check out my real life\nI ain't a tip-trail, don't care what it smell like\nBut if you feel like putting all your notions aside\nAnd talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige\nFirst name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya\nCollege educated, got degrees in papers\nBut I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping\nOr rapping bout trapping youse a freak of nature\nSuch an anomaly, speak so well\nAnd talk so collegy, such an astonishing\nContrast to all the bullshit you've been following\nOn behalf of them, I offer my apologies\nMaybe with me you'll unlearn\nPutting all niggas in a box of concerns\nMe, cause I ain't dumb, shit I'm well reared/red like sunburn\nAnd after me you'll never leave no stone unturned, uh, c'mon\n\n\nThey say you never judge a book by it's cover\nThough you appear as materialistic, just like the others\nSo I followed your words to take 'em in\nAnd I don't see what you saying so they coming off paper thin\nThat's when I felt that I would need to\nDo more than just look you up and down to see if I could read you\nAnd try to get inside your head only\nNot just stick my fingers in your middle to get you to spread for me\nSo what I learned on my path to discover?\nYour story took one ugly turn after another\nI saw we wasn't on the same page\nI would've gave you strong play but your words rubbed me the wrong way\nSo now I'm closing the case\nYou only out for the paperback that's written all over your face\nNo El' will never judge a book by it's cover\nUntil he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under\n",
