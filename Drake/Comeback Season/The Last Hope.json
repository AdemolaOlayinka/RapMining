    "lyrics": "I gotta make it out, or move quickly\nCan't allow the past to restrict me\nBet this time around they won't skip me\nI am the last hope\nDon't hesitate not even for a second\nThe hustle has become an obsession\nI'm on the front lines with my weapon\nI am the last hope\n\nCan you i-magine the last breath of Christ?\nThe last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night\nThe last step that Martin Luther took as a man\nI got the power of my world in my hand\nThe microphone brings life and death in the blink of an eye\nI was born to provoke those born to die\nI was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas\nT-dot motherfucker watch the world rape us\nGreatest strugglers hustle to succeed\nCross border smugglers tussle to burn weed\nIt means that pressure of success in the south\nNiggas watchin' what I say magnifying my mouth\nI never take back talk I apply the force\nHand blistering from many years of holdin' the torch\nWhen the skin rebuilds it grows tougher than leather\nSo we can keep on holdin' it forever\nMy names Kardinall\n\n\nJealousy's suttin I haven't felt for years\nThere's nobody around for me to be jealous of\nI bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers\nEven if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove\nI'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable\nAnd when it comes to records\nI will eat it if it's edible\nThey say the futures always foreseen\nThat's why I'm steady getting more money, more cream\nMy flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams\nI stay avoiding unlucky like 14\nAnd people get behind 'im and they fight for 'im\n'Cause he wont let no other niggas write for 'im\nAnd even when it's quite warm\nThe attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm\nThe name Drake and I don't take it for granted\nI just take it you offended 'cause I'm taking advantage mayne\n",
