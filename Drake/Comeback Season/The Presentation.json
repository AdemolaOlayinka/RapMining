I'm still here. gimme dat\nI'm cuttin lights out like it's bedtime\nThese other rappers luke-warm like redwine\nThe truth hurts so please don't rub it in\nI'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgetin'\nI'm like jeopardy-I'm still buzzin in\nEvery city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in\n(ugh) I miss cake these days\nI can't even afford a mistake these days\nAll of my favorite girls miss drake these days\nPlease don't take offense to my ways\n\nCause I need drug money\nWho got drug money\nI am talkin \"white phantom sittin on dub\" money\nI am talkin \"cold champaigne at tha club\" money\nAnd no I ain't emotional but baby I love money\nTo all these A&R's that's playin stars\nWhy you gotta act dumb (dumb)\nYour girl kno how I beat it like a flat drum\nI spit dirty like I'm chewin on black gum\nI fooled ya'll ain't shxt for me to come back from\n\n\n\n\nOoooohhh!\nYes!\nI'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this\nextravaganza that I call Comeback Season. Hope you enjoy your stay\ndrinks are on my by the way yeah\n\n\nHow the fuck jay and dame gon' break up before they meet drake\nI'm sure it can be resolved I'm just hopin that they make up\nI've perfected my craft using ?\nTryna make some cheese off a single is a process\nGET IT? !\nCraft. single. cheese. process\nSit back and admire the talent that I possess\nTop notch, no less\nOh yes\nI'm known in the city, but need to bust out like a model to show chest\nCause you deal with agents from check collections\nI'm keepin it clean in a little X direction\nAnd babygirl if you don't like me it's probably due to the fact that you are last like next selection\nThe city is mine, I control this\nYou know this\nCause you are nothing like it and I'm ? you ? this\nI'm a jamaican doctor, The Bay, WHAT UP OTIS?!\nI'm back with the form like opis I go\nYeah\nAnd I'm a teach it so you learn right\nYou can't come on this ride you need to earn height\nWith no hyrdo bill I let the lights burn out\nAnd after that I take em' back like returned flights\nYeah\nYou can't ? me ? rich\nUnited like ?\nBarmitsfa kidd\nGet your hits destroyed\nCause I keep it under wraps like christmas toys\nNo witnesses\nNo mistresses\nThis the present and I'm a show you wut gifted is mayne\nKeep it real no other youngins as hot as me\nYou a gucci groupie my nxgga and I'm a prodigy\nWhat I'm direct for\nCause I'm who they check for\nI waited for connects\nWhy you was playin connect four\nYou was playin uno\nI was doin you know -wut-eva us rappers do to develop a new flow\nI promise\nYeah\n\n\nShout out to 40-40\nYeah my right hand!\n",
