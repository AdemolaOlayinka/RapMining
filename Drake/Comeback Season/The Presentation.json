I'm still here. gimme dat\nI'm cuttin lights out like it's bedtime\nThese other rappers luke-warm like redwine\nThe truth hurts so please don't rub it in\nI'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgetin'\nI'm like jeopardy-I'm still buzzin in\nEvery city that you gotta nephew or a cousin in\n(ugh) I miss cake these days\nI can't even afford a mistake these days\nAll of my favorite girls miss drake these days\nPlease don't take offense to my ways\n\nCause I need drug money\nWho got drug money\nI am talkin \"white phantom sittin on dub\" money\nI am talkin \"cold champaigne at tha club\" money\nAnd no I ain't emotional but baby I love money\nTo all these A&R's that's playin stars\nWhy you gotta act dumb (dumb)\nYour girl kno how I beat it like a flat drum\nI spit dirty like I'm chewin on black gum\nI fooled ya'll ain't shxt for me to come back from\n\n\n\n\nOoooohhh!\nYes!\nI'd like to take this opportunity to formally welcome you to this\nextravaganza that I call Comeback Season.
