Eddie Murphy was in Norbit\nOr was it way over your head?\nDid you forfeit?\nYeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick\nHer ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit\nYeah, they need ot issue out a recall\nI'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall\nThe fundamental are needed, you playin' street\nAnd I was out at BET, but I didn't see ya'll\nThese skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall\nLettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall\nYep!\n\n\nDamn!\nI done walked in here\nLookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year\nMy shades so dark\nAnd my ice so bright\nMy buddies and my fans wanna fight your right\nLike, round one, round two, round three\nI told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me\n'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga\nNo, ain't no nigga like me\nYa dig?\n\n\nI said I know you see me chillin'\nSuper low key\nIf I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.\nAll the hustlers and the bouncers\nAnd the groupies know me\nFresh denim, fresh shades\nIn a group with no kids\nIt start up when I touch the door\nAnd I encourage ladies to touch the floor\nAs soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more\nThen after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low\nLights dimmed down\nGot alota dough\nPlus a hit sound\nWhat you mean you ain't heard?\nI come highly recommended\nEverybody my friend, even if they been offended\nThey ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision\nYou tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given\nPlus a nigga famous\nPlus I got a vision\nNot to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison\nThey takin' too long\nTheir records on hold\nThey threatened by my presence\n'Cause I make them feel old\nGuaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold\nJust remember where I lived at, 50, 000's goin' gold\nHolla at me when you see me, make yourself known\n'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home\nNigga, be a man\nYou actin' like a bitch\nI ain't actin' like I'm rude\nI'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich\nYeah, uh!\nRidin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby\nAre you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?\n'Cause I don't waste time, can't yo see a nigga lazy?\nAnd I might need some help\nBut, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy\n\n\nDamn!\nI done walked in here\nLookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year\nMy shades so dark\nAnd my ice so bright\nMy buddies and my fans wanna fight your right\nLike, round one, round two, round three\nI told you not to ever bring a bitch 'round me\n'Cause, ain't no nigga like a young money nigga\nNo, ain't no nigga like me\nYa dig?\n\n\nY.M., bitch!\nEverybody!\nTwo time on Sunday!\nSpit 'em!\nCheck ya blinkers, baby!\nCheck ya blinkers, baby!\n'Cause, to me, look like you've been turning right all day!
