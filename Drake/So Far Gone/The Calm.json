    "lyrics": "2009)\nUh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone\nDrunk off champagne screamin' in the phone\nSee my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on\nWhere did we go wrong, where do we belong\nCaught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone\nMeaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on\nWhen my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone\nWomen borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne\nAnd tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't\nFeelin' so distant from everyone I've known\nTo make everybody happy I think I would need a clone\nPlaces we get flown, parties that we've thrown\nI've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown\nIt's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown\nI'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm\nYea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm\nDedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond\nEverything will be ok and it won't even take that long\nYou can see it in my face or even read it on my palm\nLeader of the new school it's proven and it's known\nI'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne\nI know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...\n\nYou know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A\nPologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...\n40 mom always say, \"Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness\"\nYou know, so... forgive me.\n\nUh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name\nAll my first dates are interrupted by my fame\nBecause every picture taken is a fan that you can gain\nThey love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain\nIt's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain\nWomen need attention therefore women will complain\nDevelop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame\nTryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game\nI just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne\nIt's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'\nSo I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain\nHopin' western union doing currency exchange\nCause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed\nLike, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range\nAnd he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change\nDamn, and I could only feel his pain\nCause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain\nSo I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain\nHe say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain\nI'm why yo girl heart is in a slang\nCall me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame\nAs a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king\nWith my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain\nYea, And see this is the thang\nWhat they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain\nThe shit I write while staring out the window of a plane\nIs the single handed reason I Remain...\n\nMe, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.\nBut I'm the furthest thing from calm.\nI swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.\n",
