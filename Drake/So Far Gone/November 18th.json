I'm feelin throwed in this bitch\n\nI'm so high even when I'm comin down\nJust met a girl said she from the h-town\nSaid my name was drizzy\nAnd ain't nobody reala\nCup inside a cup\nSmokin ghostface killah\nGot these boppas goin crazy\nNigga I'm the man\nI sent ya girl a message said I'll see you when I can\nShe sent me one back\nBut I ain't never read it\nCause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it\nAnd I'm tellin you\n\n(tellin you) I'm always with a dime in the winter\nAnd I be ridin rims if my tires any thinner\nAirports stuntin flyin charters overseas\nFull of don perignon\nAnd the water for the d's\nDon't know why it happens everytime we're alone\nBut here we are again\nAnd I swear I'm in ma zone\nSo I'm a sip this drink till that mofucka gone\nAnd you gon' get undressed\nAnd we gon' get it on\n\nI don't give you the time\nYou deserve from me\nThis is something I know\nI know, I know\nSo tonight I'll just fuck you like\nWe're in Houston\nTakin everything slow\nSo slow, so slow,\nBut I do it to her\n\nDraped up dripped out\nKnow what I'm talkin bout\n3 in the mornin get it poppin in the parkin lot\nIt's on once again\nAnd I never pretend\nA nigga stay g to the end\n\nI swear like, everytime\nI find myself in a situation\nI just get that feelin like\nI'm in Houston\nCandy paint switchin colors in the light\nIt's about like 11 p.m\nAnd we just rollin through the city\nBumpin that screw\nB.m.o\nU.g.k\nLil keke\nAnd I feel like\nEverything just movin slow\nAnd I take my time\nI pace it baby\nYeah I'm gone ...\n",
