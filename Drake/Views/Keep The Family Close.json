I don't know what's going on\nI don't know what's going on\nAnd it's all because you chose a side\nYou're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me\nGuess it wasn't time (yeah)\nAnd of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine\nYou sit and you pray hoping that the stars align\nMy luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right\nWhen I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice\nBut you always had something to say every other time\nEverybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way\nI'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage\nSomeone up there must just love testing my patience\nSomeone up there must be in need of some entertainment\nForgiveness for your ways\nIf I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised\nSame way I'm right here still feeling the way\nSame way I'm realizing on a day to day that\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nHow do you not check on me when things go wrong\nGuess I should've tried to keep my family closer\nMuch closer\nAll of my \"let's just be friends\" are friends I don't have anymore\nGuess that's what they say you need your family for\nCause I can't depend on you anymore\nMuch closer\nAnytime people want to start problems\nIt's like \"for real, are you dumb?\"\nYou know who mans are\nI'm not afraid no gyal heart man\nAnd I'm not afraid of no cyattie\nAnd I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither\nSo anybody who want it can get it\nSeh feh\n",
