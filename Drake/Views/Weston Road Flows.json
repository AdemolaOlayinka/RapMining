    "lyrics": "One of them ones\nRight\nWeston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny\nBack when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies\nFeel like we go back a century runnin' the store for centuries\nThen bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it\nHe was wavy doin' mixtapes out of your basement\nHe let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment\nThen he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission\nWe probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him\nFeel like I never say much but man there's a lot to know\nFeel like the difference between us really startin' to show\nI'm lookin at they first week numbers like what are those\nI mean you boys not even coming close\nI gave niggas like you a reason for celebration\nYou number one and I'm Eddie Murphy we tradin' places\nLookin' in the mirror I'm closer than I really appear\nCreepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care\nNo tender love and care and no love and affection\nI got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it\nI might be here as a vessel to teach people the lesson\nFeel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together\nYeah, but here we are and it's a new semester\n40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure\nA couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings faded\nA lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation\nYour best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day\nYou treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday\nYou don't be scorin' perfect, you don't be workin' like how we be workin'\nYou platinum like rappers on Hershey's boy that shit is worthless\nYou get the message over and over like it was urgent\nAnd then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person\nThe only thing I did to end up here was put the work in\nAnd did it with a purpose\nUsed to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships\nNowadays they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension\nA lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned\nShout out to KD we relate we get the same attention\nIt's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder\nThe most successful rapper 35 and under\nI'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under\nThat's when I plan to retire, man it's already funded\nYeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin\nShe violated, I sent her back where it all started\nHow quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment\nLeave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness\nTold my Momma that I found a lady in the east\nCame cool when I got signed, upgraded the suite\nDon Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free\nI get you all you can eat just have some patience with me\nYou wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique\nLast time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats\nI used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti treat\nNow the talk of the corner store is that I'm TBE\nThe best ever, don't ever question, you know better\nBut shit ain't always how it seems when it's sewed together\nYeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it\nWeston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled\nDon't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal\nDon't let your new found fame fool you or cloud up your judgement\nTo talk loosely, I really do this\nBeen flowin' stupid since Vince Carter was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit\nDrinkin' hypnotic with Glenn Louis I been through it\nY'all was so afraid to lay claim to it\nTo busy face screwin' on waste movements\nYou was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'\nFirst take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it\nAnd they still take to it\nBig Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid\nAnd we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it\nBut money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful\nBut I'm happiest when I can buy what I want\nGet high when I want\nYeah, that's right\nYeah\n",
