If I'm guardin'\nDouble D up hoes, Dolly Parton\n\nI know things get hard\nBut girl you got it, girl you got it there you go\nCan't you tell by how they're looking at you everywhere you go\nWondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine, when all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time\nIt's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nEverything's adding up, you've been through hell and back\nThat's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nI'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so,\nI'm so proud of you\nEverything's adding up, you've been through hell and back\nThat's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are\n",
