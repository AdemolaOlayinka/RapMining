Thats me on some psychic shit\nI can tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts\nBut I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about\nRappin', bitches, rappin', bitches bitches\nAnd rappin' rappin' and bitches until all of it switches\nI swear, it's been two years since somebody ask me who I was\nI'm the greatest man I said that before I knew I was\nThat's what's important and what really happened before this\nWhen me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans\nSinging \"walking like a man, finger on the trigger\nI got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah\"\nWith fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves\nI was pushing myself to get something that I deserve\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways\n\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\nCause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)\n\nSometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance\nSometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance\nTell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good\nDo me like the women from my town would\nLeather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors\nTalking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for\nMemphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back\nAnd Ridgecrest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack\nAnd these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth\nAnd they rockin' furs like it's snowing in the south\nAnd every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like\nSo why am I in class if this is who I'm trying to be like\nSo I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade\nSoon as I realized that turning papers in won't get me paid\nAnd if I don't nothing I'ma ball\nI'm countin' all day like a clock on the wall\nYeah I need that, making major changes to the life I'm living\nI had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision\nThat was back in the days, Acura days\nI was a cold dude, I'm getting back to my ways\n\nPeople always ask how I got my nice things\nTake my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king\nI bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told\nCause I'm down to spend whatever, lately I've been on a roll\nAnd I do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, cause you know the city love it\nNigga, do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)\n",
