There\u2019s things we might discover\nCause you got a past and I do too, we\u2019re perfect for each other\n\n\nCause to her I\u2019m just a rapper, and soon she\u2019ll have met another\nSo if tonight\u2019s an accident, tomorrow we\u2019ll recover\nAnd I know I\u2019m not supposed to judge a book by its cover\nI don\u2019t wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder\nAbout her, and she with it if I\u2019m with it, and I\u2019m with it\nI know what makes her smile, but I won\u2019t know what makes her different\nOr should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass\nI know this ain\u2019t your first, but it\u2019s better than your last.\nTunechi\n\n\nShower her with dollar tips\nShawty went and bought a whip\nGuarantee the city remember your whole name\nYou throw that ho a scholarship\nAll of them ain't all equipped\nAnd this saddens me, I see the pecking order\nQuote-unquote \"bad bitches\" work the whole floor\nThose that get laughed at sit off in the corner\nLike a lab rat nobody want her\nNiggas that are married don't wanna go home\nBut we look up to them, they wish they were us\nThey want some new trim\nWe lust for some trust\nNow the both of us are colorblind\nCause the other side looks greener\nWhich leaves your turf in the Boise state\nCan't see her play or the team, cuz\nEverybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you\nAnd those who say they don't\nSouls will later on say to them \"that ain't true\"\nAll of them will have an opinion\nBut y'all know what you can do with them\nBut if you unsure, I'll take you on tour\nTo a place you can stick that in\nWell, sitting here sad as hell\nListening to Adele, I feel you baby\nSomeone like you, more like someone unlike you\nOr something that's familiar maybe\nAnd I can tell that she wants a baby\nAnd I can yell \"girl that you're crazy!\"\nOh what the hell? Nope can't be lazy\nPlease be careful: bitches got the rabies\n",
