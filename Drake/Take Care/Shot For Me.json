Yeah I made it\nFirst I made you who you are, then I made it\nAnd you\u2019re wasted with your ladies\nYeah I\u2019m the reason why you always getting faded\n\nTake a shot for me, oh oh oh oh\nTake a shot for me, oh oh oh oh\nTake a shot for me\nA shot for me oooooo\nA shot for me oooo\n\nOK look: I\u2019m honest\nGirl I can\u2019t lie: I miss you\nYou and the music were the only things that I commit to\nI never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you\nBut you believed in everything but me girl, I don\u2019t get you\nShe says I know you changed, I never see you\nCause you\u2019re always busy doing things\nI really wish she had a different way of viewing things\nI think the city that we\u2019re from just kinda ruined things\nIt\u2019s such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen\nThe men are jealous and the women all in competition\nAnd now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret\nAnd taint all the images of your \u201cMr. Perfect\u201d\nI could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer\nPraying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh\nThis is one I know you hated when you heard it\nAnd it\u2019s worse because you know that I deserve it..\n\nMay your neighbours respect you\nTrouble neglect you,\nAngels protect you\nAnd heaven accept you..\n",
