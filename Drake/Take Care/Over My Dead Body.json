You know, feeling good, living better\nI think maybe I was numb to it last year\nBut you know I feel it now more than ever\nMy city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay\nSecond album, I\u2019m back paving the way\nThe backpackers are back on the bandwagon\nLike this was my comeback season back, back in the day\nAnd I met your baby moms last night\nWe took a picture together \u2013 I hope she frames it!\nAnd I was drinking at the Palms last night\nAnd ended up losing everything that I came with\nYeah, feel like I\u2019ve been here before huh?\nI still got 10 years to go huh?\nAnd this is the only sound you should fear\nMan, these kids wear crowns over here\nAnd everything is all right\n",
