    "lyrics": "Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go\nFrom the concrete who knew that a flower would grow\nLookin\u2019 down from the top and its crowded below\nMy fifteen minutes started an hour ago\nTruth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit\nWhen I hear them talking, I just don't know what to make of it\nHate is so familiar to me, I\u2019m slowly embracing it\nDoesn\u2019t come natural, bear with me it could take a bit\nYeah, and my dreams are who I\u2019m racing with\nAnd you can see I\u2019m pacing it so that I\u2019m always chasing it\nWayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with\nI hope that my success never alters our relationship\nYeah, this life is something I would die for\nOctobers own, but its looking like July 4\nI just wish they\u2019d let you try it first\nThis time I\u2019m really going off, fireworks\n\nToday it begins\nI missed them before but won't miss them again\nI keep having the same dream\nAnd I think that I just realized what it means.\n\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nEvery night it's fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nAll I see is fireworks\nTaking off like fireworks\nTaking off like fireworks\n\nI\u2019m just such a gentleman\nYou should give it up for me\nLook at how I\u2019m placing all my napkins and my cutlery\nI could tell it wasn\u2019t love I just thought you fuck with me\nWho could've predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me\nDamn, I kept my wits about me luckily\nWhat happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me\nNow all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me\nAnd you making it seem like it happened that way because of me\nBut I was curious and I\u2019ll never forget it baby\nWhat an experience\nYou could've been the one but it wasn't that serious\nTheir was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it\nThat felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though\nYou never see it coming you just get to see it go\nYeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first\nNow I can see it in her eyes\nFireworks!\n\n\n\nEverything the same but it feels different\nMy dad called me up knowing that I still listen\nAnd he\u2019s still got his foot out, guilt trippin\u2019\nIt\u2019s been years, though, I just learn to deal with it\nFor real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport\nGot my mother in a place with some better decor\nShe searched the entire city I let her explore\nAnd now she\u2019s sayin\u2019 she\u2019s more lonely than ever before\nHow many of our parents\u2019 marriages lasted?\nI was only 5, I bet I barely reacted\nI\u2019m flying back home for the heritage classic\nSearching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?\nLet\u2019s stay together \u2019til we\u2019re ghosts\nI want to witness love, I\u2019ve never seen it close\nYeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that\u2019s why I\u2019m really going off\nFireworks!\n",
