    "lyrics": "I've been up for 4 days\nGetting money both ways\nDirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades\nRolexes, chauffeurs and low fades\nI keep thinking how young you can die from old age\nThey always tell me nobody's working as hard as you\nAnd even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true\nCuz while all of my closest friends out partying\nI'm just here making all the music that they party to\nBut party on, party on, all night nigga\nI got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga\nI've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars\nStorytellers, they ain't even need a campfire\nUhh, but I just wanna tell the truth\nBefore one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot\nThis shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park\nStuntin' hard in his yellow Goose\nYeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target\nBut a target nonetheless and I just started\nWas that directed at moi? It can't be\nThey must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free\nYeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner\nGettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner\nJealous dudes get to talkin' in they music\nAnd I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar\nYeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you\nWelcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,\nAnd if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you\nJust know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you\nDon't get impatient when it takes too long\nDrink it all even when it tastes too strong\nYeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me\nI promise to always give you me, the real me\n\nWho would have thought\nI'd be caught in this life?\nLet's celebrate with a toast\nAnd get lost in tonight\nAnd make it all light up\n(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),\nWait until the sun goes down\nWe gon' make this bitch light up\nEven when the sun goes down\nI'm gon' make this go\n\nOwww, hoes turn they heads like, owls\nI'm the man of the hour\nTriple entendre, don't even ask me how\nCon Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power\nBright life'd make your whole city light up\nA trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub\nI just landed in that G450\nCaught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy\n(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk\nThe smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk\nI don't do too much blogging\nI just run the town, I don't do too much jogging\n(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet\n'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched\nDrake, here is how they gon' come at you\nWill silly raps for you tryin' to distract you\nIn disguise, in the form of a favor\nThe Barzini me, watch for the traitors\n(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all\nThat's why none of these dumb-dumb could dun him off\nThe summer's ours, the winter too\nTop down in the winter, that's what winners do\nAnd to these niggas I'm like Windows 7\nYou let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you\nAnd since no good deed go unpunished\nI'm not as cool with niggas as I once was\nI once was, cool as The Fonz was\nBut these bright lights turned me to a monster\nSorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me\nBut I would've went insane had I remained the same me\nFuck niggas, bitches too\nAll I got is this money, this'll do\n\nWho would have thought\nI'd be caught in this life?\nLet's celebrate with a toast\nAnd get lost in tonight\nAnd make it all light up\nWait until the sun goes down\nWe gon' make this bitch light up\nWait until the sun goes down\nI'm gon' make this go\n",
