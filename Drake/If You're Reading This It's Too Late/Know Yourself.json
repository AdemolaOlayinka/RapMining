I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes\nYou know how that shit go\nYou know how that shit go\nYou know how that shit go\nRunnin' through the 6 with my woes\nYou know how that shit go\nYou know how that shit go\nYou know how that shit go\nDon't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, whoa\nThis is that nasty flow\nTop boy in this shit, I'm so international\nReps up is in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa\nYeah, and you know how that shit go\nI might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road\nYeah but you know how that shit go\nThey so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up\nThey wanna mash it up, whoa\nMy nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger\nI'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up\nI had to get back to you, whoa\nI'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women\nLike 24/7, that's where my life took me\nThat's just how shit happened to go\n\n...shell out, all if yuh eye nuh big\nAlways haffi look out, yuh no know if yuh head book out\nDun know, a de unruly boss, dis man\nNo bomboclat, otha\nAnd if a boy nuh like\nOVO or Chromatic Yuh can jus suck yuh mada!\nWith no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth\nYour girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute\nThat's the truth, OVO unruly\n\nWith my woes\n",
