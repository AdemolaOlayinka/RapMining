What you claim?\nI was paying mamma's rent when I was turning 17\nSold it dirty like Diana never clean\nMy ex ask me, \"Where you moving?\" I said, \"On to better things.\"\n\nI been in the crib with the phones off\nI been at the house taking no calls\nI done hit the stride got my shit going\nIn the six cooking with the wrist motion\nDrapes closed I don't know what time it is\nI'm still awake I gotta shine this year\nI could never ever let the streets down\nHaven't left the condo for a week now\n\nI been on a mission haven't left the condo\nThis that OvO that SZN this that new Toronto\nI get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina\nHow much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?\nAll my watches always timeless you can keep the diamonds\nTreating diamonds of Atlanta like it's king of diamonds\nTake a flick I look like Meechy look like Bleu DaVinci\nI treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City\nMan I told my city I'd be gone till November, then November came\nThen I came, right back on my worst behav'\n6 God put both hands together that's amazing grace\n6 God selfish with the love, I need all the praise\n(Woo)\nThey got me feeling like the one again\n(Woo)\nThey got me feeling like the one again\nYeah shout goes out to Nike checks all over me\nI need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been\n\nI been in the crib with the phones off\nI been at the house taking no calls\nI done hit the stride got my shit going\nIn the six cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri\n",
