This isn't making sense\nWhy are we focused on things that don't even mean nothing, girl?\nWhy can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it, girl?\nLet me at least tell you my side of things, man\nAw man, aw man\nAw, man\nMe and you are playing house, start think that I'm losing touch\nGot a tight grip on ya now, maybe I should loosen up\nWhen I leave you and I go home, I start forgetting what it is\nStart to think I got to get it how I live\nWe too busy for a wedding or a kid\nIf I'm working then I know you working\nKeep in touch with other women, cause you make me nervous\nI empower girls that don't deserve it\nI don't mean to do that shit on purpose\nIt's just that when I go home, I start forgetting what it is\nThe dream is over, I get lost up in the 6\nYou don't ever come to where I stay\nYou just rather stay up in your New York condo\nYou don't ever come to where I stay\nIf anybody knows, girl you know, I know\nWhy are we wasting our relationship on a relationship?\nYou know how sticky these situation get\nYou go up higher than me some days\nYou know what I think we could be some day\nLet me at least show you my side of things, man\nAw man, aw man\nAw man\n",
