Cashin' out with everything\nHit me when you done your shift\nI know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit\nShe on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit\nAnd lately we've been fightin' on some, \"why-you-love-the-strippin-shit\"\nYeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit\nAll, on me\nI don't deserve it\nShe's just a little too perfect\nShe's just a little too worth it\nI don't deserve her at all, no not at all\nI only text her, man I never call\nI'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog\n\nYeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick\nI'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift\nI need some company\nI need some company\nI need you to take my mind off being in my prime\nSome company\n\nI'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now\nA Mo City trip right now\nMo City trip, Mo City trip right now\n\nIt's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down\nSo let's go find a place that we can sip right now\nTour 'round the city, it's the shit right now\nIt's kinda lit right now that you're here right now\nPop a couple percs let's get it in right now\nSaturday nights, off in my bed right now\nCall up your girl and put them heels on\nIt's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now\nI'm on a Mo City trip\nI'm a dog\nI'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby\nI'm a dog.....\nI go ham, I'm a hog\nBitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'\nBy the way I broke her off\nWhat she get in to, when we take it off\nDrink so long, for a year I didn't cough\nFantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions\nDo you mind if we just menage just a little?\n\nMo City trip, Mo City trip right now\n",
