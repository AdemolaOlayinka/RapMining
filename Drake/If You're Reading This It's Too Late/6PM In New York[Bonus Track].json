    "lyrics": "2015)\nYeah, oh you gotta love it\nOh you got, oh you gotta love it\nI heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it\nI told 1da send me something and I got it covered\nSomehow always rise above it\nWhy you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?\nThe game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive\nLil Wayne could not have found him a better successor\nEvery shot you see them take at me? They all contested\nAllen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question\nLast night I went to sleep, wanted more\nTried to decide what direction I should go towards\nSome nights I wish I could go back in life\nNot to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice\n28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me\nLongevity, wonder how long they'll check for me\nProlly forever if I stay in my zone\nI speak on this generation but can't change it alone\nI heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe\nQuite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside\nOh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage\nYou need to act your age and not your girl's age\nIt gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual\nSo I guess it's understandable man\nOh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer\nI know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em\nTo show they outfits off, guess they need the attention\nI remember when it used to be music that did it\nBut then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?\nI'm managed by my friends that I grew up with\nI'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with\nIf me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'\nWe prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on\nBut here we are, yeah\nLately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence\nThey scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments\nBitches alter my message like we have words\nAnd stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve\nBitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year\nFuckin' with my image\nI've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year\nFuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year\nAnd I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot\nBout how we need protection from those protectin' the block\nNobody lookin' out for nobody\nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody\nInstead of bein' somebody that makes the news\nSo everybody can tweet about it\nAnd then they start to RIP about it\nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it\nDamn, I just had to say my piece about it\nOh you gotta love it\nBut they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public\nThat's a hotter subject\nI've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget\nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins\nShout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America\nPart of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again\nThat's that comeback flow, comeback flow\nOnce I start it's apparent\nI wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'\nBut fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions\nAnd fuck all the judgement\nYour content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?\nShit is gettin' so personal in your verses too\nI wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas\nBein' number two is just being the first to lose\nMy city dictated music, nobody seein' us\nWinter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up\nBeen observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough\nLet's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up\nYea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all\nYou rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll\n\"Best I Ever Had\" seems like a decade ago\nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go\nOh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace\nWhy you rappin' like you come from the streets?\nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees\nAnd I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves\nPhantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease\nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese\nSpecial order for anybody that's comin' for me\nShit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze\nYou see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me\nCuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free\nI'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat\nFeel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats\nMan, oh you gotta love it\nAnd on top of that it's getting harder to eat\nRappers downgrading houses\nPutting cars on the lease\nTo think labels said they had a problem marketing me\nAnd now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe\nOh you gotta love it\nAnd head to toe I'm Prada covered\nI know your girl well, just not in public\nBlame the city, I'm a product of it\nYoung nigga from the city\nYou gotta love it\n",
