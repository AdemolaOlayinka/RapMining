It's you\nYou're reckless and you know it\nThey don't love you like I do\nSay you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion\nI guess that's just the motion (oooh)\nI don't have a fuck to give\nI been moving state to state\nIn my leather and my Tims\nLike it's 1998\nAnd my dog Chubby Chubb\nThat's my nigga from the way\nOn the East side of the city\nThat's where everybody stay\nSeem like everybody calling\n'Cause they want me on their song\nIt's like every time I touch it\nI can never do no wrong\nWhen they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone\nBut, I guess that's just the motion\nAnd their phone doesn't ring when they got everything\nThat's the motion (ooh)\nI guess that's just the motion (oooh)\nYeah,\nLooking back on it at least my pride is in tact\n'Cause we said no strings attached\nAnd I still got tied up in that\nEvery thing that I write is either for her or about her\nSo I'm with her even when I'm here without her\nAnd she know it\nThe girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health\nTry being with somebody that want to be somebody else\nI always thought she was perfect when she was being herself\nDon't even know how to help\nBut, I guess that's just the motion\nYeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down\nThat's the motion (ooh)\nI guess that's just the motion (ooh)\n\nNothing less and nothing more\nI hear your heart hit the floor\n(I guess that's just the motion)\nTalking to you's not enough (no ohh)\nI guess that's just the motion (ohh)\nI guess that's just the motion\n",
