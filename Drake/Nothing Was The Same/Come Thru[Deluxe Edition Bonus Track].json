Why has it been so long?\nWhy has it been... Why has it been...\nWho you been crying to?\nWho you been flying to?\nWhose bed are you sleeping in?\nSomeone's been hiding you\nWhere have you been?\nYou deserve rounds tonight,\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\nRounds tonight oh,\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\nCome thru girl you deserve rounds tonight\n",
