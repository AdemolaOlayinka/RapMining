I should have stayed\nYou say the word, I'm on the way\nThis shit feels like teenage fever\nI'm not scared of it, she ain't either\nWhy second guess? I should have stayed\n'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight\n\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\nIf you had my love\nAnd I gave you all my trust\nWould you comfort me?\nAnd if somehow you knew\nThat your love would be untrue\nWould you lie to me?\n\nYeah, slightly took a left turn there\nBut very much 6AM\nSlightly been awake for 24 hours, so please forgive me\nMore ideas and stuff comin'\nYeah, yeah, fam\nI'm wafflin', but man is tired, fam, Jesus Christ\n",
