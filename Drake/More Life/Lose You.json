    "lyrics": "I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)\nNo snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina\nOli North pull in, like, 10 million a season\nQueen Street visions that nobody believed in\nIf we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'\nFifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd\nThe city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'\nNot when everybody out here beefin'\nWe got it, now we just gotta keep it\nAmerica's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run\nAll these number ones and we still not the ones\nNo hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun\nWent and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb\nPlease never label niggas who lay down for a livin'\nMy competition, it's beyond offensive\nI'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention\nNot tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance\nYeah, distance, I'm on a different mission\nThis the remix to \"Ignition,\" hot and fresh out the kitchen\nHow you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?\nToo overly ambitious, too late to fix it\nToo late for condolences when it's over with\nI need to start sayin' shit when I notice it\nBe open with people I need some closure with\nBe honest with myself and take ownership\nOpinions started to burn when tables started to turn\nI really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first\nExcitin' times, revitalized\nTrust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively\nI'm just takin' what God will give me\nGrateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey\nBetter attitude, we'll see where it gets me\nI know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky\nI wrote the book on world-class finesses\nAnd tasteful gestures and makin' efforts\nAnd never placin' second\nAnd even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second\nInspirin' and never takin' credit\nI know I deserve more, I just never said it\nTwo middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah\nDid I lose you?\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\nWinnin' is problematic\nPeople like you more when you workin' towards somethin'\nNot when you have it\nWay less support from my peers\nIn recent years as I get established\nUnforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage\nWhy is my struggle different than others'?\nOnly child that's takin' care of his mother\nAs health worsens and bills double\nThat's not respectable all of a sudden?\nI don't get a pat on the back for the come up?\nWhat do you see when you see me?\nWhen did all the things I mean\nFrom the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?\nMaybe I share it with too many people\nBack then it used to just feel like our secret\nBack when I would write\nAnd not think about how they receive it\nI be tryna manifest the things I needed\nAnd look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me\nBut you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all\nHow they go from not wantin' me at all\nTo wantin' to see me lose it all?\nThings get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'\nI'm overcome with emotions\nOnes I can't access when I'm stoned sober\nJealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra\nI could only speak what I know of\nMan, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'\nAnd icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'\nAnd puttin' your trust in someone\nWith the risk of financially sinkin'\nAll you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies\nEgo strokin', picture postin'\nClaimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only\nBut you just had to show me\nSee, I know, 'cause I study you closely\nI know when someone lyin'\nI notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired\nI know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet\nSometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\nDid I? Did I?\nDid I lose you?\n",
