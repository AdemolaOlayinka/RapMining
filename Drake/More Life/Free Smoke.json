I never see you\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nNiggas moves so waste\nPlease come outside the house and show yourself\nSo I can say it to your face\nIt's bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now\nSo let's just get it out the way\nLot of niggas goin' bad on me\nPlease, one at a time\nI wanna move to Dubai\nSo I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys\nI didn't listen to Hov on that old song\nWhen he told me pay it no mind\nI get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head\nAnd seein' all of you die\nAnd I seen a lot of you die\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nFree smoke, free smoke, aye!\nHidden Hills where I post, yeah\n'Ye already know, yeah\nI'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood\nFar as troublemakin' goes, yeah\nHouse party up the road, yeah\nI'm not Kid 'n Play\nThis kid doesn't play about the flow, yeah\nY'all keep playin' with your nose, yeah\nYou get high and do the most, yeah\nHow you let the kid fightin'\nGhost-writin' rumors turn you to a ghost?\nOh, you niggas got jokes\nFree smoke, free smoke\nBaka\nYeah, we outchea\nYa don know, aye?\nIt's a OVO ting, aye?\nYa don know, aye?\nIt's a East Side ting, aye?\nYa don know, aye?\nMore life\n",
