I've had too many\nThis Virginia done me off already\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nDon't switch on me, I got big plans\nWe need to forward to the islands\nAnd get you gold, no spray tans\nI need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman\nI wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\n'Cause I know what I like\nI know how I wanna live my life\nI don't need no advice\nYou're not here and we both know why\nSo, move from me when you're extra\nMove from me with the passa\nI'm buildin' up a house where they raised me\nYou move with me I'll go crazy\nDon't switch on me, I got big plans\nWe need to fall off to the islands\nAnd get you gold, no spray tans\nI need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman\nI wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nI know we can't keep it together forever\n'Cause you're crazy sometimes\nAnd I only see you sometimes\nMove from me when you're extra\nMove from me with the passa\nI'm buildin' up a house where they raised me\nYou move with me I'll go-look\nDon't switch on me, I got big plans\nWe need to fall off to the islands\nAnd get you gold, no spray tans\nI need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman\nI wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\nI'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel\n\nTogether forever\nGood morning, good afternoon, goodnight!\nI'm here to talk about More Life\nOne second\n",
