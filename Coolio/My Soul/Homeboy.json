    "lyrics": "A homeboy is someody that\nGot your back weather you right or wrong\nSomebody that\nExepts you for what'cho are\nNot what'cho got on\nWhat'cho can do for them\nIf you lucky enough to have some then\nYou know what im talkin bout\n\nFriends im a yellows happy\nAnd not that maby\nThe chance of meeting someone these days you can trust is skinny\nBut it seens that there really aint a damn thing you can do\nCuz since the 70's\nIt seems everybodys been rolling wit a crew\nA team a gang a possy or some type click\nAnd if your firm aint think\nThen your swab becomes bitched\nBe extra careful or the ones you call your partner\nCuz what they really is is a busta out ta rob ya\nAnd where ever your strength has been\nYour guided clips and a\nWolf and sheeps clothing\nCuz some of yall aint knowing\nMe and you go back like roaches in the projects\nAnd we done been through things they still aint even thought of yet\nA good homie is hard to come by\nBut most time you get done by the ones you trust most\nSo I gotta make a toast\nTo my tried and tested\nAnd strait up for reel\nThose pull yourself some x-o\nThis one heres for you\n\n\nI done fly one hell\nWalk on water\nBut im damn sure your partner\nYou can count on me to the end\nGet a pen nigga\nYou can call me homeboy\nIf I gotta quater\nThen you gotta dime\nAnd you can call me up no matta what the time\nIf you watch my back then ill watch yours\nNigga you can call me homeboy\n\nNow I done met a lot of haters in my life time\nThat I woulda smoked if I woulda had a tech-9\nBut here I stand as a man\nAnd im free ta say\nIm hella glad that my momma didnt raise me that way\nAnd the homies I grew up wit\nLocs I threw up wit\nIs the kinnda fools that you dont wanna buck wit\nWhy does it seem that the good brothas die\nAnd the evil brothas live\nAnd prosper and multiply\nFaster here at sea to the left hand side\nWont some many dirt for the homies that expired\nI hope you rest in peace\nAnd when its time for my realease ill\nMeet'cha at the crossraods dippin in the loll lows\nBut until then ima keep my rolls slow\nMy flow wont tite say rollin wit the flow oh\nThis is comin from the one and only\nAnd like MC Shares said ill never leave ya lonely\n\n\n\nMe and you is like family\nAnd everbody know that we go back to back\nAnd we go toe ta toe\nComin from the west\nWhere the sets run thick\nWhere brothas eat the bang or try ta make a grip\nI cross my heart and hope die\nI never lie\nI run out on mine anywhere any time\nMe and my homies dont get involved wit\nThat he say she say\nBut if you lost you see to ass whoppin\nWith your thing mystery player\nDecken like tekken\nSo show some respect\nWhen respect is given to you\nAnd whatch out for the 42\nFake curve\nAnd fool who got the nerve\nTo pretend they was there\nWhen last month they wasnt even around\nWestcoast Eastcoast and worldwide\nMy homies in the pen\nAnd my homies that lived and died\nIm still the same little nappy head brotha from the eastside\nAnd you can call me homeboy\n",
