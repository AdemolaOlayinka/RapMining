Coolio
My Soul
1997)
It has
Come to my understanding that
There are those, who have questioned my skills
And abilities
Since it is thus
I must
Release it, myself
Forth with be thou repremanded
Hit'em!

Hocus
Focus on the mighty mic loco
Me and the 40 jump yo ass like a pogo
You betta kick it 'cause I've been working on my mojo
Make your crew disappear like, dorthy and todo
Your trippen on me, because your girl want my thoto
Nigga, ya betta cheer before I send my homey home with your homey
Fools get creamed when they steps into my dojo
With the ghetto witch doctor sprinkling nerves on the voco
I deliver hits like my name was Fugi Moto
Platinum and gold all the way to Alcapulco
To all rappers in the national domestic and loco
Step to the fo'o get your ass rolled up like a rollo
Your points need bifocals
Ya betta try to see like todo
My name ain't Ralph Lauren but I play your ass like polo
I kick it solo
From here to soho
You ain't no man eating nigga 
So yo home style is no no

I smoke on label rosters when I rock like tha thing in the bucket doing 
95 like Rodney king
Extreme anamosity

I beat that ass blindfolded like a piniata
Scary, but prom night I was fucking Cary had her screaming Bloody Mary
