Oh, I think somethin wrong\nWhat's Up? Baby, what's goin on, man? What! What the fuck happenin?\nAw, shit, my nigga, I'ma have to face shit\nI think somebody set us up, there's feds all over the place\nThat's the name of the game, that's the way the game go\nSometimes you rise high, and sometimes you sink low\nIt's the roll of the dice\nThat you can't afford to lose\nIf you make it back to the hood then I'll see you around\nBut if they got somebody watchin, then stay your ass outta town\nIt's the nature of the business\nIt's the smugglers who lose\nIt's the roll of the dice\nThat you can't afford to lose\nIt's the nature of the business\nIt's the smugglers who lose\nIt's the roll of the dice\nThat you can't afford to lose\n",
