Coolio
Gangsta's Paradise
1995)
When I was fifteen years old
Straight dog game I was told
I went from selling pennies in a writers dike
Time and ass through the psychic breaker
Situation critical phone home
Phone home
Talk about my digital
Call phone
Ya seen a boatload of situations
Fedanglelations invalid ghetto pass late ass registrations
Boy I tell you she was pitiful 
Damn
Hopefully repentable
Get it right
I try to stay away from artificial plastic ass
Blow the motherfucking individual

Exercise your game man
Cause things is changin' and rearrangin'
Exercise your game man
Just use your brain man don't run the same game
Exercise your game man
Fertilize your grass player get that cash
Exercise your game man
But you gotta make it last

One low loco gone ride away
Into the sunset but I ain't done yet
Respect yourself and wear your best
Keep your guard up cause we'll be hard up
When your hittin' dips better check your clip
And watch the police and the Bloods and the Crips
Anyway you do it gotta pay your dues
Keep one in the chamber cause the shoes always loose
Rubber wheels beat rubber heels anyday
Put the green in your jeans and get the hoes out your halo
Or you can stay broke while your homies is rollin smokes
And sippin yak and smokin denk and tellin' jokes
Babap babap
Fool you get laughed at
I worked to hard for mine to let you take a dime
No pain no gain no pocket change
Prepare yourself for battle
Exercise your game

Exercise your game man
Make your money grow don't you be no ho though
Exercise your game man
Keep your work so tight to make your stash stay right and
Exercise your game man
Fertilize your grass player get your cash
Exercise your game man
Player get your coins be like Donald goin's

Have heart have money man
Have heart have money man

I got next you wanna run with me homey
Well I don't need players in the paint that can't do nothing for me
Show me get down nigga we can make something happen
I'm west coast east side hoodlum gansta rappin
Niggas say you want to be affiliated
Well let me warn you I'm the kinda player that's really hated
I'm rated X like Malcolm E-40 Coolio and Kam sprinkle game like talcum
You won't to make money in this game well let me show you
How to do for self cause ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Oh you frontin' like lint if you waitin on the mystery god
Cause ain't nobody gonna give you shit
You gost to get up off your ass and put yourself in heaven on Earth
Before you pass and exercise your game
Exercise your game fool

Peep game from a young ass
Rollin on the one way
Foot to the gas got that indo mixed with hash
Monday through Sunday and all in-between
I fend for my papers my self and my dream
Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or wear my patches
Call the pimp
You can call me the rat
Watch my feet hit the track ain't no lookin' back
I'm on a mission trying to put my fucking click on a mac
But these niggas don't know the half
Runnin with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass
Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
I exercise my game until I had my game perfected
I wrote the game on paper then I put the game on record
You better check it nigga don't you every disrespect it

E-X-E-C-I-S-E-Y-O-G-A-M-E-4-G
Thevz in the house better exercise yo' game
Exercise yo' game

Have heart have money man
Have heart have money man
Yell-O yell-o

Exercise yo game man
Make your money grow don't you be no ho' though
Exercise yo game man
Keep your work so tight to make your stash stay right and
Exercise yo game man
Fertilize your grass player get that cash and
Exercise you game man
But you gotta make it last
