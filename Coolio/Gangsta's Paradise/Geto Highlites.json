Get on up.\n\nEvery geto got a different name, but they all the same\nSo Coolio loco gonna put you up on game\nWe got homies who sell straps\nHomies who sell crack\nHomies who sell the bomb chronic sacks thats a fact\nCause, you from the neighborhood niggas love\nPimps, players, suckers, hoes, forty thieves, ganstas, and thugs\nTo unwrap the strap before you know what\nThe loudmouth one loced up in front of the icecream truck\nAnd broke all of the sills where the big G's live\nThe little homie be gettin' out on account\nThis time he might get stuck attempted\nOne eight seven and he's a minor with pride\nSo the DA want him tried as an adult\nThe big homey just had a son no joking\nI think his baby's mom is smoking cause she always broke\nAnd the young girls is dressing more and more sleazy\nAnd everybody and their momma talking bout OJ defense\n\nTo the hoochies in the Hondas and Sentras\nYoung niggas fightin' their case with public defenders\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\nTo the niggas who smokin' indo chocolate tired of stress\nNiggas who got warrants out for their arrest\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\n\nSlap boxin' with all the young hoochies watchin'\nDead cats in the street playing craps\nNiggas catchin dice with they feet\nThink they got the funk that one fool got stoked out\nCos he's a mark with a gun\nThe nosy bitch up the street called 9-1-1 now\nOne time his d jacked a nigga and old bitch\nLiscence and registration\n\"All I got is a drivers permit\"\nNiggas can't have shit we got dogs that rip but don't even trip\nWelcome to Southern California\nLiquor stores and churches on every other corner\nYour little brother plays pop warner\nDarks raided the dope spot\nEight year old kid got shot cos they mistook his BB gun for a glok\nAnd I ain't forgot about the homey Lano\nHe got killed by a sucker way back in the eighties oh\nI heard the homies mighties is ballin' out of state\nHe got himself off unemployment checks in Section 8\n\nHey the homiez kickin' it real\nYeh I hear what he's sayin' loc\nSometimes it's just like that in the hood\nYeh don't nothin' change of the game but the name\nThat's right you know that's right\n\nTo the young hustlers that's trying to stack that knot up\nThe house parties that's gonna always get shot up\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\nTo the negros real to stop the violence\nAll the niggers who loced up during the L.A. riots\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\n\nThe nigger with all 16 switches sitting ODs\nWho got jacked he tried to pull out his gat\nPulling sex in through his back\nNow his momma ain't all black\nAnd niggas is going to the barber to get a fade\nThey carried their dead homey to his grave\nPour out a little liquor\nHomegirl down the street with the green eyes and big titties is getting thicker\nNeighborhood clubs beat him up and crackheads be selling tvs and vcrs\nFor forty bucks so what's up\nYesterday the homey commited a bank caper\nSaw the chase on the news and read the story in today's paper\nHis little girl's just now taking training wheels off her bike\nWhile her daddy's got twenty-five to life at Fort Strike\nThe little homey just tripped and stripped\nBecause he didn't realize that the joint was dipped\nThat's right\nOG's joining the nation and it's all good\nBig G's is retaliating cause they enemies are crossed out the hood\n\nCrackhead momma's smoking whole accounting checks\nDopedealers who serve liquor pieces for sex\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\nYoung niggas going to school to be a doctor\nLate night sounds of gunshots and helicopters\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\n\nTo all the motherfuckers who think their shit don't stank\nRollin D.B.s and then appear for robbing banks\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\nThis is just a little something for a nigga\nThat's still gonna be a nigga if he don't get no bigger\nBe your own good ride\nRight right\nThese are the geto hilites\n\nGet on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up.\n\nGet on up. Get on up. Get on up. Get on up.\n",
