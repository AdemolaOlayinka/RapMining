What the fuck is that?)\nGet a piece of paper, ball that motherfucker up\nand play with it! Hahahaha\n\n\nI got Tha Alkaholik juice to wake ya up like a rooster\nBack when I was young, I used to be a booster\nStealin candy from the sto', go to school, come up\nI had the whole playground, chewin all my gum up\nYou know what I'm sayin? Playin still to the chest\nAnd I was the best, playin kickball at recess\nI play Pop Warner, golden pairs for the losers\nWe used to hop corners on the fresh deuce cruisers\nPlayin Galaga, Space Invaders, eatin Reese's\nI had all the women cause my tough skins had creases\nAnd it's been that way since day one\nGirls of the world ain't nothin but fun\nI used to watch Dr. J, come through in the clutch\nRemember New Zoo Review, and Starsky and Hutch\nI remember lunchtime, we used to rhyme out loud\nPeace to the Wop and the hip-hop crowd, I remember\n\n\n\n\nOhhh, my life, no no\nI do remember ohhhhhhhh\nI know you do\nI remember yesterday\nI remember when we played\nI remember yesterday, aoowwwwwww!\nI remember, hell, when we used to play\nin ghetto blocks through the dark\nI rememmmmmberrrrrr\nYeahhh yeahhh yeahh\nWe used to play dominoes all night long\ndominoes all night long\nYesterday, yesterday\nDo you remember yesterday? I remember yesterday\nYou remember remember remember remember...\n",
