What's a bitch to do?\nMy nigga's stretched in the pen since '92\nThem visits ain't doin the trick, drop fucks make me sick\ncos this po' puddy-tat needs a cat nip\nAnd that motherfucker representin you, I think he resents you\nHe got evidence he never presents to\nthe people in court, I heard witnesses abortin\nWhat's he doin about gettin you out to hold the fort?\nI got some ends, I'ma send you a dime and two doves\nMama hates you but damn I got love for a gangsta\n",
