    "lyrics": "Imagine looking at life through rose-tinted glasses\nAnd the policy of the people is passive\nAnd all the women got fat asses\nAnd all the homies got dubs and deeds to spend\nAnd when the po-po's pass they wave and say \"hi\"\nAnd wear a grin (hey)\nAnd everybody that you meet is a potential friend\nAnd the women in your life love you for yourself and not your ends\nAnd the population's real so there's no reason to pretend\nAnd ignore we are the same, so no one hates you for the colour of your skin\nAnd every waking thought is one of peace and harmony and bliss\nThat simple satisfaction like a plate of eggs and grits\nSenses fully alive like the feeling of a first kiss\nAnd when it's check out time you got a smile on your lips, huh\nAnd the whole world is like your next-door neighbour\nQuick to do you a favour even though we come in a million different flavours\nAnd I know there's not enough time to put it all in one rhyme\nSo I savour the flavour and sweet taste I feel from the rays of the sunshine\n\nIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm sittin in the sunshine\nThe sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine\nIiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii'm walkin in the sunshine\nThe sunshine, like the world was mine, the sunshine\n\nIf love was a flower I'd spread the petals about the planet\nAnd plant seeds throughout every city and country\nEven in those who do not want me\nI try to make some sense of the situation that we call life\nSome, verbal illustration to help ease this strife\nSome, lyrical penetration to try to make things right\nIn hopes that what I'm saying can saturate your mindframe\nAnd help you with the pain and the strain of the everyday struggle\nI don't need it all, I wanna see all y'all bubble\nAnd rise to the top then prove to be hard like a rock\nCos you know it don't stop unless we let it all stop\nSo when you face to face with adversity, just curse him, C\nAnd look him in the eye, and let him know, that he can't hurt a G\nAnd that you willin' ta risk it all\nFor the things of people that you believe in\nSo educate yourself in order to assess your achievements\nAnd if I had to explain this realer so you could see it in your mind -\nI guess it's kinda like sunshine\n\n\nBefore I continue let me make one thing clear\nTook me a while but there's three things I learned to put before my self and career\nGod, family and my fans\nI wish that I could hold your hand\nAnd be like Moses, part the Red Sea and lead you to the promised land\nOur demons blazin, and it feels amazin\nI can lay here till I'm old and grey and shrivelled like a raisin\nThroughout the years 'n months 'n days\nWhen life used to pass by in a daze\nAnd I was posted simply gettin faded, just waitin\nLivin life with the eye for nothing but cold steel, fast cash and hot payment\nImpatient to be a baller and roll a SS on Daytons\nAnd now I'm here and I promise to get my whole soul, mind, body and spirit\nAnd try to lift every voice and rhyme loud as hell so all y'all can hear it\nAnd still remember the words from that old hip-hop spiritual\nI'm livin in a Gangsta Paradise and I hope y'all remember too\nAnd even though it's west coast eastside Compton on mine\nIt's ok 'cos I don't mind if you share some of my sunshine\n\nI'm diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine\nI ain't lyin (sunshine)\nI'll be diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyin before they take away my sunshine\nAnd I ain't lyin (sunshine)\n",
