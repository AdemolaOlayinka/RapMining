Hey....(That's the way I like it)
Somebody told me that you're not my kind so have I lost my mind
You keep on doing all the things I like you got me hypnotised
(But) That's the way I like it
Girl you make me wanna move, it's a price I got to pay
For all the things you do, but I like it
Gotta listen to the groove and you gotta listen well
The way I go, that's the way I like it

Everybody now (I like it)
Everybody now (That's the way I like it)
Everybody come on (I like it)
Everybody come on (That's the way I like it)
Oh mystery lady you've got something I like
Tell me you're here to stay
You're dangerous so baby could you do me right
Will you come out to play
Cause that's the way I like it


Everybody com'on (I like it)
Everybody com'on

That's the way that I like it
That is the way I like it
That's the way that I like it
Everybody now, everybody com'on 
That's the way I like it
