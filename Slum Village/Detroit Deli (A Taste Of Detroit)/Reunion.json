    "lyrics": "Yo EL and 'Tin kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em\nYou thought we broke up but we was just reassemblin'\nLadies and gentlemen you barewitnessin\nThe villa on some classic shit like vans emblems\nIt's the guerrilla pimps, we bustin denim in the club\nThat you can't wear ya denim in\nFreakin a rhyme til every line ends with a then and than\nYou don't wanna rump and stomp in Timberlands\nShout to my nigga Killagan\nAnd all of my peeps that rep more D than 12 Eminems\nWho let the dogs out and let Dilla in?\nFuck wit this is ya loss Gilligan\nSounds similar I'm not feelin 'em\nGet the balls like Venus in Wimbelon\nWhile I'm in them fly whips five Will and them\nOn some Kim and them All About the Benjamins\nStill here\nStill here, never left, just switched the style up\nCame through, made moves to get the crowd up\nIts hard time \"V\" time nigga ya times up\nGet rowed up for the Reunion\n\nL kill'n em, Dilla kill'n 'em\nMaybe we could hook up again back wit 'Tin and them\nTogether again like armed forces on some Fantastic Four or Four Horsemen\nCan't do it without ya crew boy\nGuess who boy, comin' through with two boy\nNobody but us that rap in a clutch\nPassed and switched it up like kids in double dutch\nSome couldn't feel our style or feel flow\nNever talked our slang, never walked our road\nAll they know is these niggas is tainted\nDon't know about those rovers that candy painted\nWe've been miss quoted, miss construed, miss understood, and over used\nSo we take this time to set the record straight\nCritics skipped and did it anyway\nNow you hear our raps wit Dilla and you all on our team\nTill you heard 'Tin was gone was apart of the scheme\nSee! We still got love where was you at at?\nJust cuz a nigga go solo think we turn our backs\nMaybe we will reunite on some shit like that\nBut I gotta set it straight 'fore you twists the facts nigga\nStill here, never left, just switched the style up\nCame through, made moves to get the crowd up\nIts hard time \"V\" time nigga ya times up\nGet rowed up for the Reunion\n\nYo T kill'n em, Three kill'n 'em\nYou thought we broke up and ya you rite we really did\nI wrote a verse that I recited it was hot\nBut I had to rewrite cause I thought we was united and we not\nBut though all the love that I got for you\nPartna I picked apart ya words and I'm shocked in the interviews\nI been accused of not carin'\nWhen the city threw your furniture out\nIts not fair when I'm learnin about how stress you fell in a article\nForget a rhyme I'm just as real when I talk to you\nAnd you know that we share Kodak moments\nI wish we could go back\nBut don't act like you wasn't bugin out like a phone tap\nChasin' cars in the street\nI saw you throw up hard in the sink\nThen after hit the bar for a drink, who asked you to slow down?\nEven though niggas told me you was gon' clown\nBut I tried, and you know I cried when I saw you wild'n at the State Theater\nIn the door by the side\nThrow you in the trunk and found a preacher for you\nCause I thought you had unlawful demons on you\nSinkin fast in the deepest soil\nYa parents finally got you some help\nYou came out seemin normal and\nI heard you on medication\nHad a illness you couldn't heal with herbs and meditation\nAnd believe me; Me and T, Three kept it low\nDon't take this as a dis this is just to let you know that I love you\nBut watch the company you keep\nSware niggas don't care, but they love you in the streets\nGet ya mind right nigga...\n",
