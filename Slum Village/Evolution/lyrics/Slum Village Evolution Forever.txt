Dear us, we had a gang of ups
Stay side-to-side when most split
Consider my constituent, forever I commit
Had much in common as common sense
As time went it's hard to look you up in your iris
Knowin' we ain't feelin' the same like when we try this we liars
Now we back in square, ha we here
Yes I care, but when I touch nobody there
Poof you gone and I ain't there too
Ghost up in the room, our issues has totally consumed us
More pos than negative
I wish I had a machine that went back in time so I could cherish it
Years taste like peppermints, fresh
And got rid of stress with sex, you more or less the best
You more than breasts and dress
We messed up, success, it's our fault that our line disconnect

We should've been forever
We could've been forever
We should've been forever
We could've been forever
Yeah, us
You and me together, we must (We could've been)
We could've been together, we were (We could've been)
We should've been together, we know (We could've been)
It was tough, where we go (We could've been)
You set adrift on memory, bless
Memories of the perfect, kiss
How does some feel so perfect, get
To the point everything is pointless
Used to be sweet whispers, now words so vicious
This is so broke we can't fix it
Once was so deep I could hear your heart patter
Now shoulders are colder than winds on Saturn
Look at us, our reflection shattered
When it mattered it didn't matter, tragic
Communication cut
We don't even hug, we just say, "Wassup"
We could've been

We should'e been, could've been, would've been
Forever girl I took you in my world and I let you
Explore my universe, but at that time I
Didn't know that you would hurt me so bad
Apparently the truth hurts and I feel sad
I feel like pukin' out my guts in a brown paper bag
Dirty ass, I just knew that I had my
Number one diamond girl, 'til you told me that which
I will not speak of and don't want to think of
May have cleansed your sins, but that you still reek of
Love stinks and my lyrics be potpourri on the beat, love
Could've been you and me, but
It's time to clear my memories of us
