Uh I'll be the best you ever had when I bag that
Bet that you be seeing bombs bagdad, sabotage your manji with them assets
Connect the dots make you reach the climax

You be looking around wondering where the time went
We got it on till the morn time well spent
There's no denine, your climate is rising, I want get in side in
I climb and I dive in
I get as live as my rhyme last rhyme went

You bout to hit high note grab the bed post
When I pull your hair follicles to bring you close
We bout took it there take upstairs everywhere
Girl don't tell me no tell me yeah

So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow
I can't deny
That your one of kind
So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow

Just met you and I wrote you in my schedule
I just hope that you are edible
Cause if so it gonna be incredible
Just let me know when you wanna feel my flow
Notice how I'm talking low
I'm about to take control
It's crazy how you make it so tight
When you squeeze those musles girl I'm in it all night
Like sprinkler
We gone be squirting all nite
And I don't need no music all I need is yo 
For me to grow all I need is 3 to 4
I'm fienin for it
Cravin yo goodies and I can't ignore it
And I don't gave a fuck if I can't afford it
It stop sprinkling now the rain is pouring I'm deep exploring
My beats is knocking and she riding the beat
Keeping the pocket and in 3-2-1 I'm a release the rocket
I can't deny
That your one of kind
So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow
I can't deny
That your one of kind
So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow
I think we need to bang bang boogie
You don't stop
Keep going to the early morning we can't stop
And still we won't quit til they breaking the door locks
We coming through the floor like we bouncing on old shocks

To many clothes on, take em off
Skin tone, got my mind lost
Uhn uhn keep them heals on
Hope your body ready for the marathon
Chest 36c hips 42
Can't blame me for the freaky things I do to you
Your bodies my viagra
Each pump got you coming like Niagara
Fraction, sweat mixing
My drug your addiction
Don't need no aphrodisiac
Sit back prepare for the climax
I can't deny
That your one of kind
So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow
I can't deny
That your one of kind
So come on
We den came so gone and make the rain pour
What you afraid for let the summer breeze blow
I think we need to bang bang boogie
You don't stop
Keep going to the early morning we can't stop
And still we won't quit til they breaking the door locks
We coming through the floor like we bouncing on old shocks
