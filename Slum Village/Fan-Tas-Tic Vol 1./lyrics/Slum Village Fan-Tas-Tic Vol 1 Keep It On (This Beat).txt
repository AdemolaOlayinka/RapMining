Fan-Tas-Tic Vol 1.
2005)
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin under my seat, to get it
And I'm, niggaz in the crew say I'm the bullshit
And yes I, guess that's the reason why y'all niggaz stay gassed
Thisis a shame to y'all to watch a... mack
And niggaz don't know jack about a, cat flow
I'm sick of niggaz poppin up at my crib, all unannounced and shit
Got me duckin, dodgin under the fuckin mattress and um
It's time to address these niggaz that know my address
And this nigga don't take no mess, call me poppa boy
These Prince niggaz always shit when they ask for nuttin
Ain't never around when shit starts jumpin off... get lost boy
And about to get that ass bust the fuck back
When the S starts to act up boy you don't know how to act
Act... act... act... and my mind say
Keep it on
Rockin this beat wit y'all
You don't stop keep it on
You know I got the charm
Kinda fit niggaz be runnin; tryin to take
shit off money that wasn't yours in the first place
You know how wild it gets in my wallet, you know how wild it gets
You know my money flips in my uhh, that'what my wallet gets
100 dollar it, and then turn the shit in to polish it
Cremate and tonish it and then.. you're not a part of it
If you get caught up listenin, you're just a participant
You can't claim of this or take blame of this, particularly
These bitches get stitches, son it just, gets ridiculous
Relentlessly delicious; 'til these niggaz
transform niggaz, to un niggaz, the anti also 9 niggaz
Keep on
My mind say keep it on
Rockin this beat wit y'all
You don't stop keep it on
You know I got the charm
You either love or, leave 'em
Lynch 'em, penitentiary 'em, diss 'em
Kiss 'em, are you well in Girbaud
To be my lapdancer, didja know
I used to be a bachelor, with a widow, who slept with a ditto
I never get sentimental when I put up enough
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I... piss
Because I never had no new apparel, as a fellow member
of the mellow level, when it comes to sexual ecstasy
I get a medal...
And my mind say keep it on
Rockin this beat wit y'all
You don't stop keep it on
You know I got the charm
Keep it on
Rockin this beat wit y'all
You don't stop keep it on
You know I got the charm
You know I rock the charm
You know I rap with charm
You know I rap wit y'all
You know I rap wit y'all...
