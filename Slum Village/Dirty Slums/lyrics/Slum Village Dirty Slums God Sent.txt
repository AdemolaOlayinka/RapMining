Dirty Slums
2012)
Before I can enjoy breakfast I pray to the Lord
That I step in the right direction
Helpless in the face of destiny,
You ain't what you try to be
My epiphany is sky, honestly
See, He is me, so He I see
And you can't see defeat when your B.I.G
So everything I said, you know I D.I.D
Go way beyond me when I D.I.E
I'm God sent, don't you hear them trumpets?
Ladies get stump when they step on my sub conference
Even when the vultures start circling, thought that I was over
Than came back, repented my sins, I forgive them
I don't even seek vengeance, fuck them, burn bridges, I'm back, bitches!
Listen sisters dirty district we back top trending
It's hard time, our spot, God will it
More women, more shows, top bill it
And I'm a take it to the start, that's the beginning
Go
Things change as you start to get older
Begin to see
Clear as you get a lil sober
Took a little time but
I'm finally getting over
Stressing bout shit that I had
No control over
Niggas don't like me
Because of the music I was making
Peter don't like me
Cause they saw me eating bacon
Women getting mad talking
Bout I keep faking
And even some of the homies
Get caught perpetrating
Never in my corner to begin with
Critics talking bout he getting better
Naw I'm still certain
Teacher used to tell
My mom thomas ain't gonna make it
I'm a stop waiting for prove a nigga I'm a take it
Niggas
