Cmon you and
Me and
We can
Multiply
Cmon you and
Me and
We can
Multiply and grow
Cmon you and
Me and
We can
Multiply and grow

Feelins growin
Heart racin
Long awaited
Both impatient
Grabbed her booty, what you doin?
Ahhh nothin
Thinkin
Fuckin
Clothes off baby, let's do somethin
Turn up the music
(you such a cool chick)
That tank top, you should lose it
Ass so right I got to do this


A burnin desire
The herbs and the fire
A thin fog hindog merged with papaya
Perfect setting, we flirtin connecting
Eyes with each other, it's worth the reflection
Touchy feely
Suck me, really?
How can I argue I smile when you start to
Sways in your movement
Stayin in the mood with my hands in your pants
Playin in your pubics


Love, passion
Us, lastin
Let's get serious, talkin pastors
You with my last name livin lavish
Don't think about it, make it happen
It's all for your multiplication subtraction
Division addition equations fractions
That has you masturbatin on satin
Blankets naked relations imagine
Aw naw legs to the wall
Them drawers comin off girl 
Can we just multiply?
I want to multiply
(take that shit off girl)
Ooh can we just multiply and grow 
(aw naw them drawers comin off girl)
(aw naw legs to the wall take that shit off girl)

(ooh can we just multiply and grow)
