2010)
Hold your breath
Yeah yeah
(YAH)
Woahh ohh ohhh ohhh oh
Yeah
I'm feelin like I'm whippin in a Porsche girl
You all up in my thoughts
It's simple & reinforced
Love that love that that love
So much that we should back up
You never feel it til it happens
Then it happens
Cause I guaranteed your life is like math subtract it from your past
And the math you think it's like fast
Talladega honey moon up in vegas sharin paper
Cross my fingers hopin we don't break up
Now we made it through the basics
We seen it in an instant
Girl id love to see your ass naked
We should stay connected
Every second record is a blessin
Girl you got me smilin so F it
I take it there I take it as a blessin
I use it as a weapon
I rhyme they should use it as a reference
When people stay stick together we forever it's embedded
And everytime we go somewhere we always leave a presence, the essence
Hold your breath
(Don't let this) run away
(It's moving) faster (yeah) faster (yeah) faster
(Whoa whoa whoa oh)
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night & day
(It's moving) faster (faster) faster (faster) faster
From mix to the intense
The second I hope you smell the incense
Entice the moment of innocence
This how we came together
For better bond suited on how to break hearts
Separated then recluded
Desire was a overwhelming conclusion
Those things of passion created a guard for the delusion
It makes sense
In a mutual choice the muse & states of simple bliss forever we still here
And in a intense climax the moment a miss & the moment of passion is intense enough to commence
At last we in the depths of orgasm
The experience brought us this far
Now we out fast
Take the time when expand emotions recommence to the intense
The second is innocence
Guess the time when expand emotions to the 8 tenths
A second of innocence, innocence
Hold your breath
(Don't let this) run away
(It's moving) faster faster faster
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night & day
(It's moving) faster faster faster
Yeah it's like you million miles away
And I can't take that
Let's get that crib, sittin where that, hate that
You need that, feelin that young girls dream of the italy
Gotta lay her boat up streamlove
That paris in the springtime
Wakiki when I, when I'm lost in your eyes I see me in ya
It feels brand new
Just listen, ya mans true
What u wishin I can't do
It's my mission,
I plan to in addition stay thru the good the bad
Whether the rain or shine
Your remain is mine
Body & brains, ya fine
Yeah you all that & then some
What a perfect place to begin from
And baby if you let yourself go
Maybe we could go
Tell you this is all I know
And we could do dinner, dance slow,
A broad way show
Tell you this is all I know...
Hold your breath
(Don't let this) run away
(It's moving) faster faster faster
Don't let go (don't let go)
Night & day
(It's moving) faster faster faster
It's moving (faster) moving (faster) moving (faster)
It's moving (faster) moving (faster) moving (faster)
