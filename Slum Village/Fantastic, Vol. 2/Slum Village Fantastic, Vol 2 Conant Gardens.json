Relax, take a seat in the place\nIts livin! Living up to expectations and still\nRippin! With rhymes and filling the chrome\nDippin! Cruising the neighborhood is just local\nPimpin!\n\nAs for my memory, we were meant to be\nI am the soul Melchazidek, from the D\nRole of the world, ever see, who got the Key\nIts gonna take a master, yo, yo, the S, S\n\nWhere we come from is a place we call Conant Gardens\nMotown, we getting shit started\nWe don't stop, nahh we don't quit..\nWe just do it, do it, do it, do it do it\nCome on, come on, come on, come on\nYo, yo, yo..\nI know this, because Tyler knows this...\n",
