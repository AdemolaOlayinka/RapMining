Smoke this watch Busta Rhymes the dopest
Hit y'all niggas with the bomb diagnosis
Slum Village hot shit and you know this
Now at dates we talk funny and floss money
Chippie shot that whip down when the day's sunny
Busta Rhymes and Slum Village will make a Pilgrimage
Run Detroit all the way back to the Brooklyn Bridge
Black bats and as the crime rhyme spray in my max
Spendin my wax
I'm Feelin' one time
Blow your mind, shine, blind all y'all at the same time
Regulate chickens I always come and take mine

Yo
Live on wax
With the extra raps
See the S been doin' this shit since way back
Say that, when it comes to rap
We got a nack for that
And for that we brag
And so we rap
For this lucretive stack
Grippin the phat Caddilic
With the diamond back
If you was to ask me where it's at
Said it's all about the cheese and these SV cats
On a real
Real Detroit rap
Player haters get the actual finesse it lacks
Either words you speak can get you caught in a trap
Don't write your own raps let somebody else do that
That's word up
(Do it)
What it's all about
(Stop)
What it's all about

We smack niggas
Cause niggas don't give a fuck
Frank nearly got em pity on these niggas for what
My nigga Dane working up the game he from Earth
Show these niggas how you get your money's worth
I'm movin' in position with my mutual fund
I take it out in seconds and you don't know I as done
I'm every MC plus 3 plus 1
All around the world gave these suckers the runs
Call me Bizmal with the Pepto shit
