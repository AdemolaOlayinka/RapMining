It dosen't matter though T-3 times emcees callin the lap.\nBa-tian is the one whose in the tree of life,\nHold tight, don't ever give up in the fight\nGrace can only come into the sight.\nSoul power it ingites like the sun\nSV dominates the industry for fun.\n(Fun (fun) Fun (fun) Fun (fun) Fun)\n\nYea, yea to the beat\nYea, yea ya know it can't-can't stop\nIt can't-cant't quit\nStance answers put up your hands and fist,\nFor the band, and if ya can't stand\nOne of my man's dance sleeping on some sandman shit,(c'mon)\nLike damn man! wake up, as we bring the action.\nDon't be standing like a grand-slam hit,(c'mon)\nFor the whole fam flippin on the hand-stand tip(c'mon)\nWe get the dough weight up, straight up, the wham-bamm hits,\nBefore we go-go, we gettin on some damn-wham shit,\nA-gainst, as for second hand brand kicks.\nRippin from the Beatdown to San Fran-sis to Japan land,\nIt's the br-and new, we keep movin like the trans am\nDo-do dont stop we can't can't quit, we can't-can't\n",
