Slum Village
Dirty Slums 2
2013)
Yup I had to bring the fucking ruger to you
Old school sorta like a old cougar
Greenfiled Plaza my old jeweler
Tracksuit boombox suede pumas
Official guy to commit to
Coming with raw has never been an issue
Out of my mind losing my mental
Nigga's opposite of hard A.k.A gentle
I kill a hater when a pen stroke
I kill chickens with penis 6 strokes
I stay in them drawls staying on big boats

And we go

Slum hit em full force like a hurricane rain storm
Take form swarm like squad of yellow jackets face gone
Ninja style only eyes seen D blue fitted on top
That's the crown piece
Royalty in my vein dangerous in bang I trust
I'm dope spit lyrical angel dust
Bat with a dirty mit Mcnick Conant soldier
I'll beat composer it's Young J nicca!
D game all up ina tha
Pimping, now I got D all up in her
So effortless, it's the S to tha villa
What you figured

And we go

Go
Your a little engine I'm a engineer
You want that ready whip you better listen here
I am heavy ammunition do your best rendition
A pack of swisher s politicking with the pitchers
Better get your bitch she bout kick you the picture
And she on my dick cause she know my shit about to curl whiskers
Burning threw the bag zipping threw the zippers
Killed a nigga's swag whip them out the kitchen
Burn a lot of gas when you on mission
If a nigga smoking trash I ain't trying to kick it
Word to that lemon pepper on that fried chicken
I'm like that jalapeno pepper on the side nigga
You can't fuck with it don't try nigga
I'm canola I'm fried niggas
I'm black henny I got the rock a bye bitch from Jack city
To clap semi's and make you nigga's fall back quickly
