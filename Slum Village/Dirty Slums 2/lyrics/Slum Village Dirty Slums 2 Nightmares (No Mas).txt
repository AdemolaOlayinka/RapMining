Dirty Slums 2
2013)
Yeah, I had a dream I was falling off a cliff, I was lift, saw my life flutter out it's like a dark colored mist
Slow motion moving backwards like a action scene clip, imagine this, yo imagine how intense
Thoughts running quick, out of my mind, out of my shit, wondering how I just jump into this movie clip flip
Like Geronimo drop, did a sprint then I ran like a quarter of a block
Headed to a restaurant it was the opposite way, there was chinese mob boss eating chicken chow mien
When he saw his face turn as red as flame, I told him eat the dick flip table dash in the opposite way
I wish I could of told you macks didn't spray but they did like aerosol
Saw a pair of dudes with a pair of guns, I was gone
Hit the window crash, landed on a bag full of trash, suckas got to caught me cause I'm fast
Bump into a old lady excuse me she said no mas

I was dreaming when I wrote this, so forgive if it goes a stray
When it started I was drowning in the ocean, and my girl friend save my day
For a second I saw my life fade away, and all of sudden I had a hand full of razor blades
And grenades, and rainbow wig throwing a fucking gay parade
With a Chris Bosh jersey, with a perm wearing finger waves, at ice cream stand
Selling lemonade for days, now on youtube looking for ways to blaze
Now I'm in the studio trying to change the phrase

Mind playing, tricks on me, like I'm insane
Cold sweats in the night time, dreaming of my life, dreaming of the pain
Nightmares are is it really real, nightmares

I was dreaming when I wrote this, when It's real talk you can quote this
Marijuana thoughts cocaine dreams, devil to the world, God to the feens
I rose in a royce now, peanut butter seats with the top down
Jewelry so exclusive, think I never get caught so elusive
Break bread daily, never stale, weight money can't count put it on a scale
Balling like Rondo triple double, didn't listen to the wisdom keep it suttle
Got greedy forgot the first rule to leading, you lose your soldiers if they ain't eating
Ambush on my ride, twenty shots is their a heaven for a g my last thoughts
Nightmares
