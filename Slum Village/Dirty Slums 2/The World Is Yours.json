    "lyrics": "Slum was umm... The reason why I'm even here... Like I shop slum to Tip and that's how I actually got on... you know what I'm saying shopping a Slum village demo but He call me and was like... He wasn't interested in the slum... It's slum has always been slept on... I tell people like... They think I'm either frustrated of bitter at em... It's like naw they got to understand that... I was, I was there through all of that... Through all of the rejection... So to see them do something successfully and somebody believe in them and put something out... It's like I know how they feel\n\nToday, the usual, concrete stronger when my nigga's get noid\nStill employed, like today the usual\nConcrete stronger if tough you get it going you in the wind blowing\nSometimes it's like a jungle when it's concrete stronger\nWent I'll never be void, still employed\nSo my money don't stack when I do it like I do it\nIt's fuck up thinking niggas gotta misconstrue it\nStill on the grind like a cop on the low\nGot a lot on shit on my mind still ain't stupid\nStronger when I'm on the grind cause I gotta get the dough\nGot a lot shit on my mind I gotta go through it\nThrough it all yo my nigga's still ball in the hood\nStay sharp like a dart nigga's never win the fight\nThis is the year my people bare witness the beginning\nSipping the gin is fine when I know the world is mine\n\nWho's world is this?\nThe world is yours, lighters up around applause\nWho's world is this?\nThe world is yours, the world is yours\n\nRest in peace my nigga, yo forever my heart\nAll in my thoughts, forever my brother never forgot no love lost\nIs there anything to gain, since you left things have definitely changed\nMe and the other guy we don't even speak these days\nRemember Lady T she ain't around like she use to be\nSituations switch flames they burn eventually\nMine just flicker last two years been bitter\nYeah I did wrong, I abused my liver\nQuestion myself like why am I here nigga\nOh I had convo with God\nHe said keep it going this fake shit a facade\nSo I did it even when they said Slum was finished\nUnapologetic I did for you nigga\nFor real nigga's like you and I\nThey don't appreciate a nigga till he in the sky\nI try to explain I'm trying to keep the legacy alive\nSo I switched to dirty slums, it's like a whole nother vibe\nTime it's time it's for some action...\n",
