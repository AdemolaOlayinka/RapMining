BAM!) thrown one\nYeah, my pops was a fiend since sixteen\nShootin' that (that's that shit!) in his blood stream\nThat's the life of a crimey, real live crimey\nIf niggas know the half is behind me\nDay one, yo, growin all up in the ghetto\nNow I'm a weed fiend, jettin the Palmetto\nIn Medina, yo no doubt the God got crazy clout\nPushin the big joint from down South\nSo if you're filthy stacked up\nBetta watch ya back and duck\nCause these fiends they got it cracked up\nNow my man from up north, now he got the law\nIt's solid as a rock and crazy salt\nNo jokes, I'm not playin, get his folks\nDesert Eagle his dick and put 'em in a yolk (AAH!)\nAnd to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop\nI pointed a gat at his mother's knot\n(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit! )\nFuck that\n\n\n\nDedicated to the winners and the losers\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nDedicated to all jeeps and land cruisers\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nDedicated to the Y's, 850-I's\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nDedicated to niggas who do drive-bys\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nDedicated to the Lexus and the Ax\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nDedicated to MPV's phat!\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)\nNigguh, yeah, yeah!\n\n\n\nYo!\nKickin the fly cliches\nDoin duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day\nThough I'm tired of bustin off shots havin to rock knots\nRunnin up in spots and makin shit hot\nI'd rather flip shows instead of those\nHangin on my living room wall\nMy first joint, and it went gold\nI want to lamp, I want to be in the shade\nPlus the spot light\nGettin my dick rubbed all night\nI wanna have me a phat yacht\nAnd enough land to go and plant my own sess crops\nBut for now, it just a big dream\nCause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen\nMy thoughts must be relaxed\nBe able to maintain\nCause times is changed and life is strange\nThe glorious days is gone, and everybody's doin' bad\nYo, mad lives is up for grabs\nBrothers, passin away, I gotta make wakes\nReceivin all types of calls from upstate\nYo, I can't cope with the pressure\nSettlin for lesser\nThe god left lessons on my dresser\nSo I can bloom and blossom, find a new way\nContinue to make hits with Rae and A\nSunshine plays a major part in the daytime\n(Peace to mankind Ghostface carry a black nine, nigga\nWord up\nIt's on like that)\n\n(Can it be that it was all so simple then)\n",
