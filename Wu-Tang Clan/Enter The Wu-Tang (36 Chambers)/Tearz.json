What? (Your little brother got shot!)\nI ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet\nI saw the blood, all over, the hot concrete\nI picked him up, then I held him by his head\nHis eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...\nAw man! How do I say goodbye?\nIt's alway the good ones who have to die\nMemories in the corner of my mind\nFlashbacks, I was laughin all the time\nI taught him, all about the bees and birds\nBut I wish I had a chance to sing these three words\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter\nBout to hit the skins, from this girl named Thelma\nNow Thelma had a rep, that was higher than her neck\nEvery girl from Shaolin dissed her respect\nWe was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed\nThree o'clock in the morning, something gots to give\nMoe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next\nHere, take this raincoat, and practice safe sex\nHe seemed to ignore, I said be for real\nShe's not even worth it, to go raw deal\nA man's gonna do what a man's gonna do\nHe got butt-naked and stuck the power U\nTwenty minutes went by, my man went out, without a doubt\nI'm not pumpin' up, I am, airin out\nHey yo, he came out laughing with glory\nI'm surprised, he's still livin', to tell his story\nBut he carried on, with the same old stuff\nwith Stephanie, like a whammy, he pressed his luck\nBoth tried to be down with O.P.P.\nAin't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now\nNo life to live, doc says two more years\nSo after the laughter, I guess comes the tears\n",
