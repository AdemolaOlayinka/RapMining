A. Buh-B. Y. U\nto my crew with the \"sue\"\n\nwatch your step kid\nc'mon baby baby c'mon\nYo, you best protect your neck\n\nFirst things first man you're fucking with the worst\nI'll be sticking pins in your head like a fucking nurse\nI'll attack any nigga who's slack in his mack\nCome fully packed with a fat rugged stack\nShame on you when you stepped through to\nThe Ol Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo\nAnd I'll be damned if I let any man\nCome to my center, you enter the winter\nStraight up and down that shit packed jam\nYou can't slam, don't let me get fool on him man\nThe Ol Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking\nAson, unique rolling with the night of the creeps\nNiggaz be rolling with a stash\nain't saying cash, bite my style I'll bite your motherfucking ass!\n\nFor crying out loud my style is wild so book me\nNot long is how long that this rhyme took me\nEjecting, styles from my lethal weapon\nMy pen that rocks from here to Oregon\nHere's Mordigan, catch it like a psycho flashback\nI love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back\nI come with shit that's all types of shapes and sounds\nAnd where I lounge is my stomping grounds\nI give a order to my peeps across the water\nTo go and snatch up props all around the border\nAnd get far like a shooting star\n'cause who I am is dim in the light of Pablo Escobar\nPoint blank as I kick the square biz\nThere it is you're fucking with pros and there it goes\n\nYou chill with the feedback black we don't need that\nIt's ten o'clock hoe, where the fuck's your seed at?\nFeeling mad hostile, ran the apostle\nFlowing like Christ when I speaks the gospel\nStroll with the holy roll then attack the globe with the buckus style\nthe ruckus, ten times ten men committing mad sin\nTurn the other cheek and I'll break your fucking chin\nSlaying boom-bangs like African drums (we'll be)\nComing around the mountain when I come\nCrazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment\nMy clan increase like black unemployment\nYeah, another one dare,\nTuh-took a genius (to) take us the fuck outta here\n\nThe Wu is too slamming for these Cold Killing labels\nSome ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel\nBe doing artists in like Cain did Abel\nNow they money's gettin stuck to the gum under the table\nThat's what you get when you misuse what I invent\nYour empire falls and you lose every cent\nFor trying to blow up a scrub\nNow that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb\nShould've pumped it when I rocked it\nNiggaz so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets\nThis goes on in some companies\nWith majors they're scared to death to pump these\nFirst of all, who's your A&R\nA mountain climber who plays an electric guitar\nBut he don't know the meaning of dope\nWhen he's looking for a suit and tie rap\nthat's cleaner than a bar of soap\nAnd I'm the dirtiest thing in sight\nMatter of fact bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight\n\nYou best protect your neck\n",
