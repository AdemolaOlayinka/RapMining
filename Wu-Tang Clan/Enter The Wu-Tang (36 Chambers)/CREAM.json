Move from the gate now\n\nCash Rules Everything Around Me\nC.R.E.A.M.\nGet the money\nDollar, dollar bill y'all\n\nIt's been 22 long hard years and still strugglin\nSurvival got me buggin, but I'm alive on arrival\nI peep at the shape of the streets\nAnd stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep\nA man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.\nWhich failed; I went to jail at the age of 15\nA young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much\nTrying to get a clutch at what I could not touch\nThe court played me short, now I face incarceration\nPacin', going up state's my destination\nHandcuffed in back of a bus, 40 of us\nLife as a shorty shouldn't be so rough\nBut as the world turns I learned life is Hell\nLiving in the world, no different from a cell\nEveryday I escape from Jakes givin chase, sellin base\nSmokin bones in the staircase\nThough I don't know why I chose to smoke sess\nI guess that's the time when I'm not depressed\nBut I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?\nReady to give up so I seek the Old Earth\nWho explained working hard may help you maintain\nto learn to overcome the heartaches and pain\nWe got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks\nand stray shots, all on the block that stays hot\nLeave it up to me while I be living proof\nTo kick the truth to the young black youth\nBut shorty's running wild, smokin sess, drinkin beer\nAnd ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear\nNeglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted\nThat what? That life is hected\n\nCash Rules Everything Around Me\nC.R.E.A.M.\nget the money\nDolla dolla bill y'aauhhhaaaauhhhhahhhauhhhhll, YEAH\n",
