I can't go to sleep\nFeds jumpin out they jeeps, I can't go to sleep\nBabies with flies on the cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep\nIsh bowled two sixes twice, I couldn't go to sleep\nAiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry (?) guns\n(?) got, hit up with the big shit, bam-bam\nStop at the cheeba spot, then pass the leak spot\nSo past y'all niggaz again, you took a cheap shot\nNot knowin FUCKIN WITH ME, you get your meat chopped\nYOU THOUGHT WE FELL ON OUR FACE? YOU NEED TO BE STOPPED\nCALL ON THE CHARIOTS, CALL ON AN AMBULANCE\nYOU BETTER SMILE MY NIGGA, YOU ON CANDID CAM\nGangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls\nNigga motherfuckin eunuch, I even take which was yours\nI'm the nigga that made you man\nWhen your rap wasn't doin well, I'm the nigga that gave you a hand!\n\n\nDon't kill your brother, let's love each other\nDon't get mad.. cause it ain't that bad\nJust be who you are.. you've come so far\nIt's in your hands, just be a man\nGet the jelly out your spine!\nCobwebs, out of your mind\n\n\nI can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes\nThey shot the father of his moms, killed him seven times\nThey shot Malcolm in the chest front of his little seeds\nJesse watched, as they shot King on the balcony\nThey spat at Marcus, Garvey cause he tried to spark us\nwith the knowledge of ourselves, and our forefathers\nOhh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots cracklin\nHer husband head in her hair, you tried to put it back in\nAMERICA'S WATCHIN, BLOOD STAINED INK BLOTCHES\nMEDGAR TOOK ONE TO THE SKULL FOR INTERGRATING COLLEGE\nWHAT'S THE SCIENCE? SOMEBODY? THIS IS TRICK KNOWLEDGE\nTHEY TRY TO KEEP US ENSLAVED AND STILL SCRAPE FOR DOLLARS\nWalkin through Park Hill, drunk as a (FUCK)\nLookin around like, these (DEVILS), I'm ready to break this world down\nThey got me trapped up in a metal gate, just stressed out with hate\nAnd just, give me no time to relax, and use my mind to meditate\nWhat should I do? Grab a blunt or a brew?\nGrab a two-two and run out there AND PUT THIS FUCKIN VIOLENCE IN YOU?\nI can't go to sleep, I can't shut 'em son.. I..\n\n\nDon't like the game, nigga use your head\nYou should be callin the shots instead\nThe power is in your hands..\nStop all this cryin, and be a man\n",
