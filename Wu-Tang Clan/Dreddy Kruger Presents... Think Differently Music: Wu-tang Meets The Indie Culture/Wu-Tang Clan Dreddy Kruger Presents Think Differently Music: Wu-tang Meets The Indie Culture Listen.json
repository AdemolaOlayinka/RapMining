    "lyrics": "I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine\nWho introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game\nWe did in the rain, on the hood of a Range\nBut Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin\nShe told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye\nBut back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine\nIn the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no\nCause it's a poor man's girl, and I will never give love\nTo how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was\nMartin had a dream, nigga, I did too\nTo make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoup\nSo, I took it that thaw, and hit the street\nWith bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids\nMomma said, never get high on your own supply\nEspecially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich\nReminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears\nSee the more money that comes in, the more I disappear\nFresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear\nNew Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear\nWatch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling\nOff that needles warm embrace, in a sexual heeling\nThis tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great\nWatching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the\nI'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past\nBaby, you gotta trust me, cause I gotta girl and you got a man\nI don't want you to judge me, I just wanna be your friend\nBaby, you gotta trust me...\n\nAiyo I live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts\nCause with that big butt and a smile, she be waiting to flirt\nWith a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt\nAnother dick in the jaw, more dick in the george\nWhile you home sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours\nThat's just how women is, I reminisce\nOn when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch\nAnd I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied\nTell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine\nThe plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time\nYou get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine\nI'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga\nWith this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime\nLine for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage\nBut it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage\nIt's me, blunt: the artist, y'all niggaz is garbage\n\nSweat jackets valor, rap money, looking like crack money\nRelax, money, niggaz, it's raw, sweet aromatic\nBackwood, fanatic nigga, this is Cali\nVigilante's tattered, the wife beaters and khakis\nI'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda\nB12, rock selling niggaz vacation's over\nMedallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit\nWhenever holding case, the cops try to stop us\nMy henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers\nGet up on my life, nigga, the kid's proper\nWrist glint, the big shit, cult following fans be vixen\nThis is grown man business, pay attention\nOr lay your position, fuck around and have a fatal collision\nThe moment where you should of made your decision\nI made it, I'm living, I'm paid and I'm winning\nFrom the aid of my wisdom, I created a system\n",
