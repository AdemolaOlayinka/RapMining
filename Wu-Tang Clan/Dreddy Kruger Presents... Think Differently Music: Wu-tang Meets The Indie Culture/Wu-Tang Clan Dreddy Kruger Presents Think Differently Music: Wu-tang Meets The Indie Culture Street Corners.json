    "lyrics": "Looking on various street corners\nI'm sure you've seen it yourself\nStanding on the corner, is an alleged brother\nDressed in blue or green, red and black\nAnd, spouting the news, that the revolution is coming\nAnd you better get ready, sort of like\nThe end of the world is coming, unfortunately\nThe world is just gonna get dragged on and on\nAnd, we have a poem that we've written particularly\nFor the brothers on the street corners\n\nYo, standing on porches in front of houses and corner stores\nI'm born to more, horrific than syphilis, cuz where we live is\nHell on earth, where was heaven when shit's real\nWe sold dope to get mill, for white folks in Smith field\nFuck Israel, it's Kill Hills, spilt pills for my bill\nWrite wills for my seeds, to live from, who take some\nWho give some, for brothers that was lynched hung, the symptoms\nNever go away, a stir away from colder ways\nHaving ramblings and savages, blessed, from us asking\nThis whole cross, is more rust in Florida oranges and lost orphans\nI offer thought for food in full courses\nI've soared into the night glow, my hat's low, my roots grow\nFor you to soon know, I reap what you sow\n\nWe just land down from Liberia, young black man\nIn control of the pillars, millions buried in dirt\nHow many railroads do you own? How much clean chrome you own\nThis for my ancestors names engraved in stone\nOn the roads where the rebels once roamed\nWe built homes, civilized our own\nKing Solomon Childs, beautiful as black, this time\nWe will walk on water, this time\nWe will see through the lies, this time\nPrepare troops to move in, expand the runways\nBuild bigger bridges, nine millimeters from brady\nWe living in war, so prepare for submission\nApache helicopters, a black man's face on a dollar\nThe pigs constantly watch us, the streets is obnoxious\nBaby of the first nine, homey, in toxic\n\nThe first seed of a dope fiend, she A.D.D\nNeedle parked off spring boughed, by she, wanna be\nWhile her siblings is rich living, she ain't bitching\nMama's working two jobs, try'nna maintain a living\nFew years passed, now she's getting raised by the streets\nSide by side, watchin' hustles, now she blazed like the streets\nThis is for my women living in the struggle\nGetting brought into this world without asking for the troubles\nOf the every day life-life, a battered wife\nA single mother's holding it down, while the world so trife\nCrack fiend, you could of been something better in life\nNow hold your head up, ma, you know it ain't over, right?\nYeah, this is for my Russians on the grind\nOff the boat struggling try'nna hold a nine to five\nYeah, I seen enough with these eyes\nI thank the most high, I'm still alive\n",
