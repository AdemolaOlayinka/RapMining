(La the Dark, Sun large)\nGZA, Ras Kass, yeah (what's up, Wu-Universal)\nLegendary...\n\nNow it's the real beginning of the pages of Shams\nSpit that heat rock, that make fiends make vapors of grams\nSham's is the greatest fan, rock big cables of sands\nValleys and trunks, I got the mack ten\nWe can hit the alley with iron and thumper\nTake it to the hands like the brand new Leonard\nNiggaz goin' no mas, when the bullets go in him\nYou dealing with a night stick toker\nThe ice pick poker, trust, you ain't like this joker\nAnd the set, devoted to opening your neck\nWith the tech, as you sit in a Lex'\nYour next move, is slipping, your last move is shitting\nAs your body gets soft, the shotty went off\nLittle soldiers, you're out of position\nGuns go off, Shams is a greatest fan\nA rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost\nWhite five, black five, with dollars to toss\nTwisted by the dark side of the force\nBlack biscuit, by park side in a Porsche\nYou're off sides in the fort\nWe are survivors of the war of good and evil\nI'm in the hood, in the hood with a desert eagle\nWith my Brooklyn peoples, now feel it...\n\nDarkman, my persona's like Tony Montana\nHow we used to sniff coke, how I puff marijuana\nTry, play me today, I'm a kill you manana\nFrom, far with the K, or up close with the llama\nI'm like an African king in a castle in Guana\nChest dripping with jewels, one hell of a rhymer\nStudy lessons in Athena, building with an old timer\nSo I, always been wise ever since a young minor\nGet CREAM by any means, follow Malcolm X theme\nSo I'm often posted, in a rumor with that thing\nGot a limited support from the Sing Sing regime\nI'm Hannibal Smith and they like the A-Team\nKeep my head on the swivel, when I serve a dope fiend\nUpgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam\nFucking with me, you better be real as you can be\nLa Trapacanti, a well known rhyme general\n\nWho say Ras Kass don't spit fire, he a liar\nThat's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire\nWhen you mention me, not about penitentiary\nWins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century\nAhead of my time, school niggaz like Timbuktu\nCause I'm original, like rap feeling the jewel\nGalosh is by B.U.F.U., By us fuck you,\nTry us, fuck you, you die, y'all got gats, but him buck too, nigga\nSip the Grey Goose, and conned it, they know the room service\nIn Hotel Rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars\nWho ask why U.S. Defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar\nBush gave 6.46 billion to Halle Burton\nFor troops support efforts in Iraq\nMeanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that\nThe rape over, Chaney talking, 25 dollars for a case of soda\nDraining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters\nBut won't pay they soldiers, Halle Burton workers make\nFourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year\nPlease who 25 extra, taking fire in combat\nRecruit all the niggaz, that die from where I'm at\n18 years old, talking 'Kill, where Saddam at? '\nBut can't have a gat, to protect where my moms at\nI love to crunk, so what, plus I'm gangsta enough\nTo piss in pimping cans, pimp cup, rack again and pump it up\nHow bitches still get fucked, niggaz just want a forty and a blunt\n\nYo, these youngsters they grow up on the block\nWith the product in they socks, and the fully loaded glocks\nToo many die in vein, and it's a crying shame\nThe murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top\nAcquiring apparel, through growth and development\nOn they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant\nThe brutality of war, never changes\nAnd the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous\nFire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than\nWhat they ever had, experienced yet\nIndictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill\nSuddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field\nThe great boundaries of both man and machine\nCan have one at the point, to murder all in between\nYellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol\nGiving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title, what's up?\n",
