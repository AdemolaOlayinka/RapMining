    "lyrics": "For many though, this birth place\nOf the automobile and organized labor\nWas seen as a promised land\nFor 25 years, sudden black migrated north\nSeeking middle class prosperity\nBut by summer of 1967\nMuch of that hope, had turned to hopelessness\n\nYo, you that wrong, I crack a sky, a black dawn\nPut your wallabies back on, it's time for a swarm\nYou that wrong, you get your Timberlands blacked on\nJungle fatigues, bulletproof vests back on\n\nI blow dimes all up in your way, spit a dart in your face\nYou don't know me in the first place\nMy birthday equivalent to forty earthquakes\nI smirk gray, polly on streets where the motors leaks\nKids hold heat cause they plates is gold\nMy weight's in goal, turn about face behold\nThe street scroll, never once flow, said wise old\nElder, I hear beats like Helen Keller\nFeel 'em straight out the speaker, to my animated blood flow\nPass records around like contaminated needle, heave hoe\nMy sound heavy like tree fall, I flee halls, bleed through gauds\nCarry grym reaper in millimeter form, you spill a liter for him\nBorn to take any soul, relentless henny flow, chops heads like guillotines\nSmoke Philly's with my queen, I'm still in the machine\nDT's at my day job, talking bout the date room\nThey may drown me, my shadow too vicious\nCan't keep them around me, hide 'em under the hoody\nHe live like Whitney, intelligent like Eli\nWe ride like the genie, pass time\nLike a clock used for a Frisbee, George Roll\nWallstreet, that's the shoes that fit me\n\n\nBurn a building, Wu-Tang bats all in the sky\nCausing a black day, I see through the eye\nOf a tornado, false feed with greater labels\nTower of babel labels, follow room when I call the chrome\nTell home lord, I slice you, I engineer\nTrains of thought, diabolical molecules\nLight skin marksmen, part taming your follicles\nTwelve men equipped, seven rappers can vouch too\nAbout you, fuckin' with me, my Clan emblem\nRemember where it came from, four eye, cock and name one\nDart at the cranium, fuck up your suit coat\nEach rhymes I wrote, aimed at the ivory coast\nPiano keys I tap, like a nervous child's knee\nI served in the streets for the army of God\nBring your bomb squad, national guard, I'm passin' through bars\nEscapin' prison, armed with great vision\nGod given heredity, better be\nThe armed bank robber with pedigree\n\n\"Think Differently!\"\n",
