I hit the block hard, Timberlands is scuffed up\nNo justice in the system, look around, it's just us\nThey tell me only God can judge us\nBut they ain't ever met Judge Kufner\nI'm looking at this cracker on the bench\nDon't understand, I only sold crack to pay the rent\nBut that's possession with intent\nPlayer, I ain't stressin, I'm a pimp\nMy bitches love the cocktail dressin with the shrimp\n\n(Killa Hill!) Cause we do it like how we do it\nThis is big truck style shit, diesel fluid\nSlay bitches with the Shaolin slang\nStaple-TOWN, Park Hill, we just doing our thang\n\nC'mon, yeah! You fools don't have a clue, do you?\nMoving them ki's crucial, troopin like Isuzu\nNigga your weed doo doo, we burn that Cali kush\nMy flow be on steroids, that shit that Barry took\nHurtin the game like the corns that's on your daddy's foot\nMy niggaz carry big guns, y'all niggaz carry books\nYou shook niggaz get stripped, beated and wiped out\nConEd status like Fab nigga, it's \"Lights Out\"\nWhat your life 'bout? Nigga my life plush\nI lost both of my parents, my nigga life sucks\nUs Billy Boys hold toys cause they don't like us\nRaw like the nose on a fiend sniffin that white stuff\nMoving with the semi, eggplant pennies\nHoppin out the Bentley lookin like I just won an Emmy\nNever been a sloucher dog, cause I'm an alpha-\n-male got that product on sale redeem your voucher\nLeader of the gang, I'm Spanky, you Alfalfa\nLittle Rascals, with no hassle, I will out ya\nSincerely doubt ya, and I will house ya\nPosted out in front of your crib just like a scalper\n\n\nEvery time pick up the mic, I put work down\nCops don't like me cause I live in the murder town\nMy high school homies sold crack, through songs\nYou can't get right through the team like two wrongs\nMad criminal minded cream motherfuckers\nType of subliminal rhymes scheme muthafuckers\nCan't shake the monkey, life is a bitch\nJake tried to jump me, wifey a snitch\nKilla Bees wild like C-74\nNew York bitch, adolescents at war\nFuck the government, yo they made us this way\nYou a faggot - listenin to what that chick say\nEscape route, gotta be free like furlough\nFuck hoes, nigga I don't care if the world know\nHardcore, move with or without Clan\nDiss me in the cab and they murked your man\nI'm a general, don with the crazy hype game\nYou don't like me, wanna feel my knife game\nKilla Hill son, they don't like where I live at\nCame from Hollywood so I fight to give back\nReal talk, hard jeans and hard dick\nMove in and out of state like drugs and garbage\nNigga feel me, or nigga feel that blast\nATF bitch, just guns and cash\n\n\n(Killa Hill!) Cause we do it like how we do it\nTrife, Meth and Cap yo, nuttin to it\nSlay bitches with the Shaolin slang\nStaple-TOWN, Park Hill, we just doing our thang\n\n(Straight up... Wu-Tang Killa Bees)\nThe best that ever do it\nOne-oh-three-oh-four, you know how we do\nLegendary Weapons\nCome in our section, get a blessing\nCause we don't play\n",
