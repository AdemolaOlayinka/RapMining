    "lyrics": "Born with the struggle, used to hustle for crumbs\nFillin blunts in the building front thuggin for ones\nFull clips, fly dicks, down somethin to pump\nWhole cliques fly whips, dimes nothin to son\nCity boy on the corner, I was so involved\nSo the drama I embraced it with open arms\nWas tryin to shake the pain, hopin I could break the chains\nEvery day the same, who am I to make a change?\nWill my niggaz risk it all just to play the game?\nAnd the young'uns goin through it tryin to play the same\nThrough the rain, through the fire, handcuffed by desire\nSent to your son, forgive me for the sins that I've done\n\nMy life, my pain lasts forever\nNothin in these streets makes it better\nMy life, my pain lasts forever\nNothin in these streets makes it better\nAnd so I live on\n\nSittin here thinkin drinkin got a, lot on my mind\nIs my, life shrinkin am I, caught in the times\nIt's a, quarter to nine and I'm, grabbin my 9\nI had dreams I just, wanted to rhyme\nClimb my ways out these whack-ass ghettos\nI signed my name on the line with the devil\nStill in my prime weight but lost minds are settled\nPots on the stove, move grandma's kettle\nLate for my job, he thinks he's a star\nShe hates her husband, she says I'm a slob\nMixed feelins she ain't gettin involved\nBattle of the sexes, the planet's off its axis\nThe IRS God damn I owe these taxes\nThe truth hurts, but I can take it\nIt's a long time comin, but I can make it\nNo mistakin, the cream is back\n\n\nI'm standin on my own two\nI got my niggaz, true niggaz, real niggaz!\nStop the wheel really? You only feel me\nif you walk the same road, talk the same code\nStill dwellin in the hell and find the time to make a home\nThe few who escape will try to find a safer zone\nI ain't waitin for Obama, never doubted him, I'm proud of him\nHe real, he'll spend a couple million in the housing then\nseein is believin, my vision is blurred\nCause I ain't seein nothin I heard, really nothin but words\nThe bottom line I'm still stuck to the curb\nSky high but it wasn't the sherm, really nuttin but herbs\nI risk it all for the cause\nEven if it's war with the law won't pause\nI can't won't don't stop, I ain't got an off switch\nDyin tryin to live it just to get a small part of it\nMy squad is sick, type that you don't want problems with\nRollin like 70 Mack trucks, what's stoppin it?\n\n\nOhhhhh! Ohhhhhh said I live\nI live, I live, oohhhhhhhwhoahhhhhhh\n",
