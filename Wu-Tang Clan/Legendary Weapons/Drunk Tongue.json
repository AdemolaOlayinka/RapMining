Product pumpin like a piston hardly gettin by\nOr probably gettin high off what you pitchin, while we sittin fly\nTryin to keep it simplified, movin like we Semper Fi\nMy niggaz is born to ride, y'all niggaz get sent to die\nAll you do is mention I, general exemplify\nSin City been gritty, ten city enterprise\nAbout to make it twenty-five, utilize my witty mind\nto improvise my goal to reach the, all-time city high\nYou don't want the semi flyin nine at your Hemi fine\nAll you gotta do is send me mine, you got plenty time\nMad cause my ones up, and scared cause my guns bust\nGod's mind is divine, I'll shine on you dumb fucks\nSin never dumbstruck, dram'n on the dump pumps\nHit any man in the face they're like, sanitation dump trucks\nDodge magnum chunks up, big enough to slug thugs out\nThe bubble butts hop off the cots to play double dutch\nGlock in a double clutch, you don't want no trouble trust\nRug cutter you're jugular, promise you your blood'll gush\nDead smack in front of us get clapped dead you front on us\nYour back ledge, you rats feds can't front like you one of us\nStack (Bread) like (Wonder) from the winter 'til the summer come\nUpgrade to made, that's when the Benzs and the Hummers come\nI ain't want no Hummer stunt, ask how I stack well like Maxwell\nNigga tryin do a little some'n some'n\n",
