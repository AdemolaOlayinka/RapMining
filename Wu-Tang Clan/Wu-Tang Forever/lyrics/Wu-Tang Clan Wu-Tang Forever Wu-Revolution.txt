Swim the deepest sea, with you my brother

Gotta hold on
Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
Save the children
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our future
They're our future
Was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
Save the children
They don't know who the true living god is
And all the orchards in the world
Save the children
So they worship what they know not
And let evil lead them in the wrong direction
Far fewer men than right
Now you got the ten percent
Who are rich slave niggas of the poor
Who teach the poor lies
To make the people believe
That the old mighty true living god
Is a spook in the sky
Save the children
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
Save the children
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous people who do not believe
The teachers of the ten percent
Save the children
Who is all wise and know that the true
And living god, and teach that the true
And living god is supreme being black
Man from within
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslims sons
Peace we out



I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu to survive
Must now be taught to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spreads
