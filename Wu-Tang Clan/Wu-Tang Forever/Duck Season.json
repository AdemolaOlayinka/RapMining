    "lyrics": "Scrape y'all motherfuckers\nThis is my word, when you see us\nWhen you see us flashing and shining\nAnd building and adding on\nY'all niggaz just watch it, hear me\nOnly ones that who we got respect for\nIs them niggaz that we say peace to\nHear me, pay attention, put your shoes on\nYo, my team be bellyaching hungry niggaz on the swarm again\nPirahna niggaz bite dick, yo Son, it's on again\nWhat up, he made a move, try to assist it\nListen kid yo, you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop\nBack to the novel, you Son, it's logical\nHow you figure God, what, flow on the track, flip the obstacle\nNow my proposal, it's the global\nFrom California to courts, it's over God, so taste the tofu\nRemember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November\nShorty called me Santa in December\nBut guess what, my Wally's got messed up\nAutograph presser what, blast enough to blow your rest up\nWe scrape that, Land O' Lake that\nMy dolo rapper get you sent back\nRepresent the gentlemens who bent that\nFlash medallions like Italians\nLa costra nostra, we moving through your hood like a poster\nFlex this, Lex and Diamonds hold the settlement\nSo keep the bust the gun Boo\nLike that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents\nAdd on, the billboard sloan\nCheck it now, you get the gold dick award\nIt's like jail and it's the sixth floor\nTest me, floating in the S.E., now let's see\nHalf of y'all niggaz built your rhyme from my sess tree\nFaggots, homos, yo, my flavor liver than a dobo\nStay militant kid, push it like bolo\nYou fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it\nFace one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one\nPlease, y'all niggaz money getting low\nBut did you come back, set up shop, and get the phat dough\nTired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all\nSo what the deal now, blinking with us or put your shield down\nFaggot, fuck fuck around punk, battle for cream nigga\n\n\nYou want to pound crab, nah let his hand swing\nI ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings\nNo more said, knew your chump ass was dead\nWhen I saw the four four reflecting off your shiny forehead\nIt's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga\nStill shame on a nigga, who tried to run game\nGet virgin and perversions, fucking bitches with Persian\nBugs watching niggaz like the turgeon, it's the surgeon slugs\nstill pounds when Bobby Steels 12 gauge gonna pay deadly chronicles\nWe, held up in Gotham take heed and protect your seeds\nWe fall like all the leaves, who lack tranquility\nIn your rap utility to fuck with the abilities\nRaised like a sperm cell to the ovary\nMicrophone post tone like a rotary phone\nAge of poems and poetry, old sloans\nExplosive head bullets, black hooded\nInvalid footed ninjas, who full metal jacket clips\nAnd know how to put it in you\nSurrender your goods and your merchandise\nFor no purchase price, I'm certainly a heist\nFor your ice and curtains and vice\nCome quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society\nBecause of variety, so maintain your high anxiety\nAnd lead them to defy me, diary...\nI need 18 points for my next joint\nThis high and mointed king, to make a deal\nI be the one to appoint, Steve Ripken must have been sniffing\nTo catch something so dope, it left minor c-lits pussy dripping\nI fuck hundreds of bitches, and split millions of dollars\nAnd built with thousands of scholars\nMy life saga from the hildred of horor\nLegal kid brown in Nicaragua\nGave birth to MC's, seeds and bank robbers\nWe drove with pistol whips into world-wide trips\nAnd my dick's been sucked by the finest lips\nStand to tell the contestants, in the world's best repressment\nBut none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons\nOr my queen and my seeds, in the home that I rest in\nEnter my dome get blown to 99 sections\n\n\nThis rhyme has no limitations, this time there's no hesitation\nCollecting minds at the door, you want it niggaz it's yours\nThe flavors raw, what the fuck you think I'm flowing for\nIt's rhyme and reason, bite the bullet\nNiggaz is foul in this duck season\nWe add odds till we even motherfucker\nBad asses, high times, lower classes\nTaste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses\nBring it to him, room service, under pressure\nAnd mad nervous, waving guns at the clergy\nTicallion, we ain't worried\nKeep them sick niggaz seven-thirty\nPicture this, watch the birdy\nThis bastards is rolling dirty\nWith sharp pins that be stabbing you\nPins and needles, needles and pins\nNuff said, dick in your mouth\nLike pimp was bled, as I race track with thoroughbreds\nDucking the feds\n\n\nYo, my ice slow fly up on the keyboard son\nNiggaz ran up on me law, praising what we do by the lords\nThat's right, exile the fake, hit them niggaz like weight\nFeed a fool, let the fake evaporate\nReconstruction, that's the whole science of mine\nProduction, ya'll niggas guess who stuck son\nLeft his meth son, switch, finger itch\nStaring at you like a bitch, maybe y'all niggaz snitch\nYouse a loner, Adidas shell top with lye\nsipping Corona, read the rev report then bone her\nBuy you some jewels, here's some food\nNot neccessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo\nWe in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom\nBaggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs\nChill, y'all niggaz know what time it is\nJames Bond Beamers behind me, on Bacardi Lime and\ncheck out the pitch like Nolan Ryan\nHe cought a slug for lying\nYeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying\nMilitia, rolling in position\nCasa Blanca Cuban Link Christian\nLex the tally back whistling, fake fucks\n",
