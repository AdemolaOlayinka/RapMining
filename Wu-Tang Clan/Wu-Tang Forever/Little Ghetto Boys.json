Posin you like Donna Karan wear\nNigga save that, the same shit you had it last year\nYou be runnin with them outsiders\nThat shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders\nYour Mac is big, got a little grip, yo\nYou think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said\nRemember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up\nShut up, whole fam want the science and the letter\nIt got back to me some niggaz in Medina askin me\n\"You know some niggaz in the gold E-Class,\" splash to me\nYo that shit you had in Vegas\nYo, it coulda got us both sprayed up, they seen the Ac, know this traitor\nHair sa-laundry and Shorty like Karan\nHer fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on\nOctavia with all the ice on, yo\nShe own a carwash now, her little Keon doin triple life\nMarry a Son who got baked, it coulda been\nfor a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her\nShit is fucked up when they got us yo\nShe fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown\n\"..face responsiblity\"\nShe fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown\n\n\"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto street\"\n\n\n\nYo all of y'all niggaz got the whole story wrong\nTalk what you talk but twist the real song\nWhen it comes down to this, not a licensed driver\nShow y'all niggaz whose style is more liver\nThis is not a act this is more actual fact\nNuttin but experience placed upon track\nwith the true sound, not lyin out the crown\nWhen we not workin we hardly be around\nYeah see the light, right now we could fight\nYou not a real brother you just a fake type\nthat get on the mic then, throw your cliche\nHalf the East coast soundin just like Rae\nIf you a Gambino, give credit to the flow\nIf you not a part of this kid act like you know\nFuck the studio, Cappachino the great\nFly cherry head niggaz like planes out of state\nI ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you\nIf you want some then stop frontin is the issue\nIt's my turn, live niggaz could pass\nTwo-face-ted rappers push they shit last\nStraight off the edge, into the rubbish\nPeep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet\nI drink Evian water while my thoughts get published\n\n\"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?\"\n\n\"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets\nWhat you gonna do when you grow up...\"\n\n\"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?\"\n\n\"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets\nWhat you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?\"\n\n\n\nOne is invulnerable, in fact\nit involves strenuous breath control\nOut of all techniques, it's the most difficult\nThe human body has a hundred and eight pressure points\nThirty-six of these can be fatal\nThe remainder, paralyzing\n",
