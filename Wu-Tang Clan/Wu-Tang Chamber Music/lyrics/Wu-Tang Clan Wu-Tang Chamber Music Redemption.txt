"I have taught you well, everything I know
You have even surpassed my skill
But why is it so important?!
Years ago, your father was a royal guard
The best that there was
He won many royal merits
But still, during a special contest
He was beaten by five {?} experts
He was disgraced, and so was our Clan..."
"It was long ago, but he has never forgotten that day though
And you are his only hope, to redeem the Clan
and retrieve our honor..."
