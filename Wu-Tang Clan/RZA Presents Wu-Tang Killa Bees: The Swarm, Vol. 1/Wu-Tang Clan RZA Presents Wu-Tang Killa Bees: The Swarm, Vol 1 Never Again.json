    "lyrics": "Feel this,\nTo all those races, colors, and creeds, every man bleeds for the\ncountless victims and all their families of\nthe murdered, tortured and slaved, raped, robbed and persecuted\nNever Again, To the men, women, and children.\nWho died in their struggle to survive, never to be forgotten.\nReuven Ben Menachum, yo..\n\nYo my own blood, dragged through the mud\nPerished in my heart still cherished and loved\nStripped of our pride, everything we lived for\nFamilies cried, there's no where to run to, no where to hide\nTossed to the side, Access denied\n6 million died for what? Yo a man shot dead in his back\nHelpless women and children under constant attack\nFor no reason, till the next season, and we still bleeding\nYo it's freezing, And men burn in hell, some for squeezing\nNo hope for a remedy, nothing to believe\nMoving targets who walk with the star in their sleeve\nForever marked wit a number, tattooed to your body\nLate night, eyes closed, clutched to my shotty\nHaving visions, flashes of death camps and prisons, no provisions\nDeceived by the devils decisions, forced into a slave\nDeath before dishonour for those men who were brave\nShot and sent to their grave, can't awaken, it's too late\nEverything's been taken, I'm shaken, family, history, the making\n\nNever again shall we march like sheep to the slaughter\nNever again shall we sit and take orders\nStripped of our culture, robbed of our name\nRaped of our freedom and thrown into the flames\nForced from our families, taken from our homes\nMoved from our God then burned of our bones\nNever again, never again, shall we march like sheep to the slaughter\nLeave our sons and daughters, stripped of our culture\nRobbed of our name\nRaped of our freedom and thrown into the flames\nForced from our families, taken from our homes\nMoved from our God and everything we own\n\nSome fled through the rumors of wars\nBut most left were dead, few escaped to the shores\nWith just one loaf of bread, banished, hold in for questioning\nAnd vanished, Never to be seen again, I can't express the pain\nThat was felt in the train to Auschwitz, tears poured down like rain\nNaked face to face, with the master race, Hatred blood and David\nMy heart belongs to God and stay sacred\nRabbi's and priests, Disabled individuals\nThe poor, the scholars all labeled common criminals\nMass extermination, total annihilation\nShipped into the ghetto and prepared for liquidation\nTortured and starved, innocent experiments\nStripped down and carved up or gassed to death\nThe last hour, I smelled the flowers\nFlashbacks of family then sent to the showers\nPowerless undressed, women with babies clumped tight to their chest\nCrying, who would've guessed -- dying, another life lost\nCount the cost, another body gas burned and tossed in the holocaust\n\n\nNever Again, Never Again\nThe final solution is now retribution\nRemedy, Wu-Tang..\n\nFIRE!\n",
