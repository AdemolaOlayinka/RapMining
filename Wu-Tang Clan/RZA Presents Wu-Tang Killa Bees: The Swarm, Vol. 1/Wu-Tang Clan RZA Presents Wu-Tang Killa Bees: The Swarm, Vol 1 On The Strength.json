Begga sorcery\n\nON THE STRENGTH\nTime is money and gain\nON THE STRENGTH\nMath is one and the same\nON THE STRENGTH\nWhining is something for pain\nON THE STRENGTH\nBeggaz for ever remain\n\nBuddah Hava who lives the ways by nature\nEscape on a galactic space caper\nTo the nexus, transportation a glass Lexus\nForever present is Wu Chi in the essence\nOf life is immortal\nWe travel through portals that's phenomenon,\nParagon through the octagon\nMy Chi gong is calm, express through Alvatron\nLove hell alright is the day destroys the night\nKnife divides today feathers are harmonious\nAnd universal ways to escapades\nWe take what we need to survive and stay alive\nDraw more sometimes as we break through the other side\n\nThe Knoliton master law and order\nAstrolgoic civilize the human family throughout the populous\nLive forever like metabolics\nEverything I speak has logic\nEstimated all partsman of the chief king fistboxin'\nInscribe within the Begga doctrine\nManual infold I roll protect my physic\nFrom elements of the globe\nWe communicate like space probe,\nRemainder of the square frag the author\nOf the final chapter seven star grandmaster\nPugilist John Trappa M.D.\nGo-go thirteen professional MC\nI bomb squads like Hank Sharpley\nExpose a fraud like hardcopy\nI know click and shoot like paparazzi\nWith the never conclusive euro language of usage\nStreet persona, my thought is blacker than the pre-madonna\nFar and beyond, If lickin' who warfare like Sadam\nInvade everyone like Ghangis Khan\nForever will remain\nAnd the Beggaz will continue go on...\n",
