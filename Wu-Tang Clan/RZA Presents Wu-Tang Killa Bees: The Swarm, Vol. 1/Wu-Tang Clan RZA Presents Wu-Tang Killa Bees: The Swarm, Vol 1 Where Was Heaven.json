    "lyrics": "This goes out to all my cats in the projects\nJust livin it, still livin it\nThru the rough times and the bad times,\nthe crimes, where was heaven\nMust be somewhere here, though, for real\nI never seen the place\nMaybe some place you got when you die\nAn ordinary cat from outer projects, since I was younger though\nMom raised her children, pops dipped a long time ago\nIn my mind I see flashbacks, I had no fancy clothes\nSkinny, ugly, knotty head nigga crying with a snotty nose\nEven though my father neglect, he pay the child support\nHadn't seen him all these years, I hug his ass in court\nAlways saying I'm comin to get you and I be waitin too\nHoliday and birthday presents was never comin through\nRemember at the age 13 I started smokin weed\nHanging out with cats that was older, start to run the street\nDropped out of high school selling drugs, impressin chicks\nSpent most my cheddar on gear, my man was buyin whips\nNew York, Jamaican, Miami niggaz, flooded Virginia quick\nCause signin work only if buying, prices was high as shit\nRemember when I first got hit, I seen the iron spit\n50 cash bent in one corner bleeding where pellet hit\nMy man Shawn, he held on strong\nSlug burn through his lower back side, crack his spine exit his arm\nLost him twice on the hospital table and when he died I cried my eyes out\nI couldn't take it (damn damn), but the same things continued to happen\nNiggaz got bust, I'm a kid with a grown man's mind turning corrupt\nPlaying innocent in front of my elders\nI was running with them cats that be robbing too, I couldn't tell 'em\nIf my name was up in any type trouble, my moms would tell me\nJust like you brothers into some shit go get a job or something\nJust a little bum on the street, not working hard for nothing\nScratch I made when I was pumpin, I'm here to offer somethin\nMaking sure the crib stay tight, for real I wasn't no dummy\nTell me where you getting this money, I wash a car be lying\nSaying anything 'sides drugs selling, my sister seen me on the block\nTransact' with fiends, be saying I'ma tell it\nGrowing up was hell no doubt, I wonder where was heaven\n\nShit, it's like yesterday, you know?\nIt all comes back though, but still\nBut still livin on the block, but still fucked up\nYou know? Crime affiliated, Crime Syndicate\nWhatever you wanna call it\nYou know what I'm sayin? Affiliated with the bad shit\nAll the time just cuz I'm a victim of the projects\nNow I'm a grown man, still It's like life dealt me the wrong hand\nCat's that was my man be frontin' or either found dead\nSound said incarcerated just turned a new Dad\nRemembering them long ten months from slingin crack bags\nMom put me out with the quickness, carry your black ass\nI'm still coming back to the crib, oh so you back? yeah\nMa' I just came to holler to see how you doing\nNothing's changed after all these years\nStill hustle for some gear, smoke weed, still drink beers\nI tell you from my heart, yo, 'times I'm like yeah\n\nI wonder if heaven was a place in this planet\nYou'd find me right there.\nWhere was heaven.\n",
