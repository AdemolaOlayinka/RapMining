Fingertips touching and you'll come back

Why don't you know?
The sexy little things you do
(The sexy little things you do)
Oh, oh why don't you know?
The sexy little things you do, ooh

Yo, yo
My flows remarkable
Doc walk like Kane from Kung Fu round the globe
Throw obstacles I'll hurdle them
Herb and whack MC's, drum racks
To the rims to the caps
Yo Meth, Tical, and D
I'm ASAP, I'm crack a don chicken hunting at KFC
In '83 I was that scrub TLC talking 'bout 
Now I rock the house
Chalk 'em out

Yeah no doubt who gots the biggest ass in the house
Young miss fillet-a-fish
Salt water trout, pretty young thing
Got a tongue ring and dirty mouth
And she whispering them sweet nothings
I hear it out
Baby you got me like Joni had Cha Chi
Until she got high and went and fucked Potsi
Lady Godiva
From day one a dick rider
Liar, liar set your pussy on fire
 
Yo Doc be off the wall 
We keep a Marly cheap
Pulling a Harley deep with a jar of grease
Come 1-5-1, straight endo, the spot
I fuck brown sugar behind the fiber glass window
Its Doc not guns don't sling weight
The only thing I sling is condoms for spring break
(Fuck 'em) How we do it?
(Leave 'em) How we do it?
(Get the money) The pussy
(The weed) Now do it
 
Now take your coat off and stay a while
Now honey child if you're gon' be acting funny style
Then I don't need ya
It's Saturday, this night fever
Shit is popping, Acheeva my mouth cotton
Tis the season for draws dropping
And heavy breathing
You ain't skeezin' you dick teasin' 
I'm leavin'
Acting rotten, I got no time for games
I'm no joke
Drop that ass when I'm finished
And watch it smoke
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
