(Yeah)\nFuck it, let's go nigga\n\n\nSo S-man, what up? We gon' do this or what?\nI know he sittin on somethin, we been watchin for months\n(Plus his man just rolled up, he's about to Re-Up)\nLet's hit em both at the same time\n(Damn it's like you read my mind)\n11:29, time to move out, ring the doorbells\nSoon as he open the door, we whip the two's out\nEverybody hit the floor, scooped up the drugs\nPistol-whipped his hoe, he said the money's up under the rug\nin the master bed room (Check it out Monk)\nBut if you lyin, tonight all of y'all gonna be sleepin in a tomb\nMonk what the hell we got?\n\nBingo, we hit the jackpot\n60 G's, 80 pounds, 2 brick, crack rocks\n2 glocks, fresh out the box\nIt's time to smash out\nKill a bitch, empty the clips, and then shake the spot\nThe homies in the car, let's go, it's time to get home\nBack to the spot, divide it up, so we can stack on\nSew the block up, bubble up, cuz times it's tart\nSlippin in the streets, your ass'll pay to serve charge\nCuz it cost to be the boss\nTough talk and get your braces charmed\nSpot Rusherz rush the spot, what the fuck you thought?\n\n\nWe all wanna bubble, only with my niggas\nWe all wanna bubble, only with my niggas\n",
