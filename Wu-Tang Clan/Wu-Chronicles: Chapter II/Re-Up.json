(Uh-uh, uh-uh) Never, no\nCause I write the rhymes, the rhymes I write be bumpin'\nRhyme architects that be brutal on production\nMy brick house, you can't blow me down\nMy thug drug music, smoked out ya town\nRadio Shyheim, you can't choke me out\nCause where the fuck I'm from, we moke popo out\n\nShit is crazy real in the field\nWatch nigga blood get spilled over $5 bills, nigga\nAnd major drug deals on the real\nWatch a nigga get mils, and his bitch get him killed\n\nYo, P let's get this dough quick, shit on the wrist\nPlatinum bracelets, see his Range's the whip\nSummer time, comin' quick you got eighty-five percent\nNigga talk that slick and get his brain blown to bits\nThrow you in pits and nigga lock like pits\nGot my whole fuckin click, nigga, handlin' fifths\nThey blastin' and shit, I'm after that kid\nWho rock that glass Benz, nigga throw it in his wig\nKidnap his kid, throw his brain in the fridge\nSlappy and pig, nigga, place where I live\nA nigga lookin' jig and I run up in ya crib\nWho the fuck murdered BIG? whoever did, do a bid\nAnd let his daughter drop a fridge on his\nMove like the wind to Brooklyn Bridge, straight to my crib\n\n\nClose the mothafuckin' door, what?\nGot my nigga R'son on this track\n12 O'Clock on this track\nProdigal Sunn on this track\nGot my nigga Shyheim the ManChild\nDefinitely Brooklyn Zu\nRewind that shit, nigga\n",
