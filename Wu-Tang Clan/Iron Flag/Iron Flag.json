I seen a lot of those\nGettin fly with Ghost, power just buy the boats\nRZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls\nPlatonic chronic shows, tonic prose\nOff the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho\n\n\nDevestatin shockwaves strikin the nation\nNewsflash, warn the people, assassination\nThe hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form\nIn any form mixed untampered it's pure\nDissect each line of the rhyme\nFind my ingredients and nutrients\nTeach patience and obediance before movement\nKiller bee student enrollment\nI'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic\nQuote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk\nSlang therapist Shallah Rae\nplus the people, with magnificent wordplay\n\n\n\n\nAiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path\nThey quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast\nExpose the craft, first picks chosen in the draft\nI don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash\nKnown to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash\nFloatin past in an alley with the oak dash\nShow the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair\nThey goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads\nCrabs wanna play me close and grab\nCan't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs\nWhere the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag\nYou posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last\nWith heavy weights that elevate the whole mass\nCompose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab\n",
