(\"Shaolin shadowboxing!\")\nShit's bout to change..\n\n\nAiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on\nhow to get rich, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch\nBanana coat matchin with the ratchet\nLil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin\nJump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird\nFlow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant\nIt's like the family that flipped on you for lyin\nBuried you alive, left your whore cryin\nWe on your floor look more doors\nDey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggaz is armed\nAnd when we get there, all my niggaz in the mix\nYeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich\n\n\nMost people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio\nOvernight your whole style was bitten in the process\nEverybody switched they names like\nWhatcha call it, any fast (?)\nIt was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches\nClarks from Digi left the game dizzy\nOoh got busy, that dancey shit slid through\nWe had to stay hood cause that's who we been through\nRZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power\nProof that power plastered divine classical lines\nMathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable\nNow niggaz with the radical shines\nIt's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me\nWe back motherfucker that's right, it's the W.T.C.\nWorld Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan\nWe brought so much heat that we was givin you tears an' shit\n",
