That'll be the.. day, ya busta\nIt gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya\nLike red heat with hammers and sickles\nI milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues\nIt's just us, so what's what if any can touch us\nThen lord strike me down where I stand at now\nwit this bottle of Remy, gettin' fucked up child, listen\nThe most notable MC, ya source for hip hop quotable MC\nOf course it's Tical!\n\n\nThe Princess, the Pope, incest, dope\nChoke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke\nThe man not for joke, we all out for broke\nPlus the herbal that I tote, the murder that I wrote\nYou can't do me none, my Uzi weighs a ton\nI'm comin' from the slum, Wu is number one\nI stumbled on the drum, the Gods are troublesome\n+Rumble+ when we come, boy you better +Run+, +Run+\n\n\nAiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips\nFlashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch\nWavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs\nSick winter gear, been on position is where\nCall him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+\nSlang rap, you get your whip wrapped\nSwing through the hood calmly\nYo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George\nDust shut shit off, whips spin off\nGet off, slips, which, wiz\nMind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines\nPick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies\nDip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine\nRub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines\n",
