Dolemite classic\nThe vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett\nI handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered\nNo coke, dope mixed down with acid on record\nBroken down and crafted in seconds\nLady's choice, the golden voice still peppered\nBetter, respect it, bitch believe\nI pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves\nI air out the showroom, the shit can breathe\nFix your weave, behold my expertise\n\n\nI got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back\nI got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back\n\n\nTake it back to the (?), leanin gettin rec room punch\nWe in them authentic alley switchin joints\nMajor general niggaz, five stars\nBoth arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggaz palms\nSilencers, garbage bags of hash\nFor every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash\nGash you out your burner fast\nYou swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass\n\n\n\n\nYo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?\nGet the fuck away from my door!\nWe got big guns in here, coke over there\nWith blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair\nAnd there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips\nStan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers\nThe shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin\nBig cat nigga all season\nOn the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice\nDiamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU\nBlew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out\nEighteen karat rap between noodles\n\n\n\n\nUp at Killa Bee headquarters, full rips is poured up\nI saw (?) sippin Henny from a iced out cup\nYo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip\nI sit took, three drags off the honey-dip\nNow what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?\nAin't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin\nRead the headline, that was blast on today's Post\nDead King, thought he could ace Ghost\nQueen, couldn't even jack Monk\nProbably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk\nBdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library\nReadin Malcolm's, \".. Any Means Necessary\"\n\n\nJohn John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice\nSo nice like New York they had to name him twice\nName your price, I black out then change the lights\nGive you the same advice that I gave my wife\nDon't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine\nLet the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine\nCulture shock, for some of us that's all we got\nWhether you ball or not, you can all be shot\n\n\nNew York, New York, legendary rhyme boss\nCode name Charley Horse, bust with blind force\nI smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check\nYou crabs test, can't measure the threat\nI dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah\nRap barracuda, three XL kahuna\nSure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance\nI'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then\nCreep it through the states in V8's and 12's\nMy weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself\nThe Noble, Sir I mass mogul\nKnown to blast vocals, and move global on you locals\n\n\nThis is grown man talkin, coward I split your head\nI'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed\nHit Chef for the rice and peas\nNuff respect Father E tumbled at ease\nMy brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic\nThey need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict\nFloatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee\nYour hands can't hit what your eyes can't see\n\n\nFrom dark matter to the big crunch\nThe vocals came in a bunch without one punch\nRare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable\nReputation enhanced, since the cause was probable\nSo you compare contrast but don't blast\nthrough extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast\nWatch the block thirst for one became all\nShot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall\nDelivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity\nThe blind couldn't verify the authenticity\nThe rhyme came from the pressure of heat\nThen it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets\n",
