(Wu-Tang style)\n.. justice!\" (Wu-Tang style)\n\n\nSlept on this hazardous enterprise\nHit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise\nWeek self-captivity became months\nThose who were holdin it down they hold a pump\nDo we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?\nGot a mass of starvin niggaz wanna eat supper\nUnfair corruptions lead to abductions\nCreatin wider circles of destructions\nSo we attack, with the pen and blaze in\nFrom the terrifyin to the fascinating\nQuick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit\nFull of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits\nThey heavily defended airfields\nBut they bodies rot behind punctured steels\nWhen I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?\nOh that water was my liquid of choice\nForensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet\nPowerful projection, noise is deafening\nCarrier battle groups, that's threatening\nHigher level bombing, plus\nThe shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud\nIn the same crucial manner but different style\n\n(Wu-Tang style, Wu-Tang style!)\n\n\nYeah..\nAiyyo once again, all blunts again\nYo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in\nAllah's helpful most, innovative raps\nthat brought wealth through, shot out the belch too\nWe holdin, automatic semis with sick lines\nRun up, body niggaz, break down shoddy niggaz\nStyles so sharp, state of the art\nGreater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin darts\nFlowin like water, \"Apocalypse Now\"\nGun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us\nRunnin through parkin lots, don't get caught\nLet off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks\n\n\nIt ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin in the hood\nGotta a hundred wolves waitin in the woods\nfor the Clan's forthcomin\nI miss you in the game a court summons\nAnd fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up\nE'rything was wack 'til we popped up\nAnd got it on and poppin like Orville Reddenbacher\nPotnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa\nWu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha\nRequest lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin\nand thinkin, \"What's that SHIT they be smokin?\"\nI'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis\nKeep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious\nY'all niggaz got some fuckin nerve\nto critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word\nBlah blah blah, like N'Sync\nKiss that ass \"Bye Bye Bye\" knahmsayin? I ain't playin\n\n\nMany shall come, few chose to stay exact\nTrack after track I'm fightin for survival\nBefore me I see hills and mountains they sway\nThe words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean\nI walk water holdin y'all suspended with the vocal\nWhat's the total people that came to see the Gods?\nI gave thought talent, construct my best poetry\nPotentcy, high-level content\nSide effect may cause a tec to eject, many places\nAll ages streets to cages, split faces\nShoutin nuff love to the peeps from Miami\nWe live from Pulaski and spread glassy\n",
