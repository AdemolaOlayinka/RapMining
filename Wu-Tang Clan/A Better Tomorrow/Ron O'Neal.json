    "lyrics": "No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar\nSo we can have a better tomorrow\nOh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard\nFor a better tomorrow\n\nCoach, put me in the game\nI'm for real, other peoples tryna to put me in them chains\nWhatever the topic, let's put it in the frame\nWe can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains\nI'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain\nKill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change\nThese veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same\nI don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane\nPrecise, 'bout shoot them at the range\nBut I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers, I'll just shoot it at your dame\nY'all never should have threw me in the game\nFound a new word for weed, that was so mean\nI threw it in my name\n\nMy soul laid out on the block like arms spraying\nThe law hating, warring like Blacks and Caucasians\nGod versus Satan, I'm laying in the dark\nWith the Mossberg, waiting, letting off first basing\nSlim from the cotton club washing a scrub\nDeuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love\nHold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub\nThis flow, call it OJ blood on the glove\nAbove rap, capital G's speak on the facts\nPlease believe that, meaning that I keep it a stack\nHe's back, he a beast on the track\nThe only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack\nFeel the bass make sure he shake, murder verse, first forty-eight\nManslaughter, nearly caught a case\nI crack heads more than base\nStack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the base\n\n\nI seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw\nCome out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw\nDry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport\nWe all holdin' the torch\nFew staircase murders, some burners don't blam right\nGuns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight\nFull of X, AK's, whilin' in lobbys, bulletproof PJ's\nFuck around and get spunned like the DJ\nCSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay\nSpongebob niggas get scars nigga\nI'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga\n\n\nSee ignorance wouldn't allow retreat\nSo you rather pursue death than admit defeat\nSee ignorance wouldn't allow retreat\nSo you rather pursue death than admit defeat\n\nAy yo, I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits\nSpit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness\nLive to tell the tale, cause only God's my witness\nBeen a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic\nI hold the steel like Ron O'Neal\nSuper fly, do or die, killer hill, Brownsville\nNever win, never will, yes I can, yes I will\nPut a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill\nLike a dentist, my apprentice speaks with a vengeance\nDemented scientists counting bodies in the trenches\nThat's judges off the benches, got inches for y'all wenches\nWe plant those hot seeds then drove in cold winters\n",
