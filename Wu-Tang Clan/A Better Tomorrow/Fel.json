A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but emotionally irrational\n\nI never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt\nI rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt\nStill feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately\nNo other emcee could get with me, is way I felt\nDon't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way\nThe first time you heard \"Protect Ya Neck\", the way you felt\nLike no other hip hop record ever made you felt\nCards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt\n\nEvery time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt\nWorldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is\nAnd we ride out to all of our music is\nYeah, we gets busy, teach the youth because we know how it felt\nGive em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt\nSo each and every person to recognize what they felt\nWatch your mind state because the evil could be felt\nYou never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt\nI've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt\nWe would last for a night, but a better tomorrow\n\nI felt the angel of death breathe\nWhen I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze\nI felt like it was the end of a dynasty\nLike I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves\nKarate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'\nThe floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in\nFelt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone\nSo I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone\n\nI never gave a what on how the next rapper felt\nI take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt\nI don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt\nMarker, walk on water, I see how Jesus felt\nNo rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt\nThis about a thesis that even paraplegics felt\nThese boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it\nTill you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt\nI'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt\nMight not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt\nRemember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt\nI burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt\n",
