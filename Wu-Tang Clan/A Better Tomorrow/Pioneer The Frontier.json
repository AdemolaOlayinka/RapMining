High self esteem, straight cream on the top\nRidin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks\nDirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc\nWatch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors\nFeds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores\nI be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more\nThe Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs\n\nPioneer the frontier\nPioneer the frontier\nPioneer the frontier\nPioneer the frontier\n\nGuaranteed I bang hard\nI plan to leave the game large, no brainwash\nThe devil himself could not persuade God, my blade's sharp\nCircle my square, I dare you Braveheart\nBefore I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?\nMy lines get in your cells like 7 Ls\nAny problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail\nLet me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail\nBut let it be my life story if they ever do tell\nKnow I died for what I live\nAn intimate connection for that infinite reflection\nThat's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid\nSo now my stock's high and shots fired\nMy niggas who was tight with the kid\nI'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on\nDeck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don\nIf I'm frontin' then respond\nIf not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm\nAnd your set, the fuck is y'all?\n\nYou enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18\nchamber sixth, hands down, I crush bricks\nBacks that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back\nClassic Wu RZA track with mathematic actual facts\nThat weigh heavy, the universal strikin' attack\nDance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete\nThe shallow steppin' ninja\n",
