    "lyrics": "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today\n\nLook, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty\nNever let go when you've got ahold of your enemy\nEagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary\nI\u2019ll never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow\nI throw a great entre dart arrow to your temple\nAllmighty to the insidious\nPlan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand\nWe never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show\n\nNever let go of your mind\nIt\u2019s a terrible thing to waste\nTo lose, but it\u2019s very hard to find\nBeing that ignorance is lethal\nWe must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people\nNever let go of your plan, execute\nSo when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land\nNever lose knowledge of yourself\nFor it may become risk to your health\nAnd great loss of wealth\n\nNever let go of your cream, never let go of your dream\nPlayers retire, but they never let go of the team\nIf you a rider then you never let go of that thing\nPull up your mans\u2019 like you better let go of that bling\nThis life\u2019s crazy, too many life sentences, maybe\nFatherless babies on the block but they father 380\nThat\u2019s just the hood lately, never let go\nI\u2019m what the hood made me\nMomma told me to find a good lady\n\nNever let go of staring at the death\nLike yo, that's your best blow\nI still hold on like En Vogue\nThe cold go to war with the heat\nEyes wide, never falling asleep\nAll the talking is cheap\nCall'em, ultimate warrior, W.W.F\nI come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck\nSet it straight for the seeds, to see a better new\nTake the real life by the rings and I ain\u2019t letting go\nI ain\u2019t letting go\n\nNo matter what the odds be\nNo matter how hard we\nYou never let go\n\nNever let go of the fight, never let go of the mic\nMy honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride\nAnd memory of those who have passed to the other side\nNever letting go, I\u2019m never letting go of my beliefs\nMy faith, convictions, real\nBoth hands holding on, never let go the wheel\nWe hood legends, misunderstood\nThese lessons, learned\nGrowing up for manhood\nKeep focus on the prize what you better do\nA little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to\nStates what\u2019s ahead of you, always on the schedule\nSmoke the gold leaf down to the residue\nLetting go, is something that I never do\nThose who let go, live life regrettable\nNever let go of your hope or your rope\nEyes on the prize, never let go of the scope\nWhen I\u2019m in jail, never let go of the soap\nHold on, boy, never let go\n\nNever let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme\nNever let go the love of your seeds, or your queen\nNever let go your heart, or the place you started\nThe feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted\nThe old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs\nI never let go the love I have for thy father\nNever let go the glow\nThe more I know the more that it shows\nI won\u2019t let go, even if I decompose\nYour seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on\nPass the baton, life is just the marathon\nAnd ain't' playing to win it, it\u2019s an epidemic\nNever let go, that\u2019s what the god recommended\n\n\nAnd there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom\n",
