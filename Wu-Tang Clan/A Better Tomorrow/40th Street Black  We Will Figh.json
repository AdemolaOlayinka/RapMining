INS best out\nFact, you knew that before he left the house\nFresh at the produce section\nGaze at my shine like a showroom necklace\nDeath wish, stepping in, declaration\nI'm checking niggas like test questions\n\nAcross 110th now,\nCamera hawk hawks the sidewalk\nWhen they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you\nHustlers do you, gave you your first toolie\nCutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf\nThink graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape\nAnything of pulse and heroin\nEmcees frozen, cuban links golden\nEverywhere I'm opening it up, they kill it raw\nMath here, I got 'em keep coming back for more\n\nYo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up\nY'all don't want the drama, word up\nThe Wu first up, the game is the world versus us\nY'all was good 'til the world heard us\nY'all ain't want them Clan birds up\nY'all done want your man served up\nThat'll get the fans worked up\nHomie really wanna play, stir it up\nI'm a catch me a wave, surfs up\nGliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this\nMake me wanna smack that trick\nMake a killer really wanna yap that kid\nIf he opens up his yap that's it\n\n\nMass of minerals in a glass house\nPlaying the 4th neutrinos will blast out\nLetting out verbal thunder bolts\nUntil the world attract old and younger folks\nCharge with the vitality of magnetism\nIn large reality with massive rhythm\nThe manual without technical part\nFrom the beginning give off an electrical spark\n\nI respect you if you respect me\nEverything's for real, WTC\nNo fake ass shit, don't front the Remy\nBreak bread, never have pockets empty\nLet's get it, flip it up then we can spend it\nThe money train, killer bees on your brain\nW's everywhere, one on your chain\nHomeboys for life, please don't change\nYou can hide at my house, it ain't no thing\nIf you see the pigs, don't say jack\nCall me original, don't say cap\nI'm on the low, might be at the murder\nHolding off the place y'all cats never heard of\nYeah, chicks wanna peep me out\nNasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth\nBut now I'm out, about to link with stinks\n\n\nBang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode\nForget the street codes, show you like a deep throat\nIt gets rougher, you struggle from the heat stroke\nBlast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke\nRadio for back up\nPolish your act up, nigga need a back up\nSyrup in my cup, no cut, straight up\nUG's in the court, never miss a lay up\n\nWhen the emcees came to live out their names\nSome rode the bus, some rode the train\nSome motherfuckers wish they never came\nWhen they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang\nNine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard\nBody, the party is still, but God body\nIt's out of shape models coming through with those bottles\nEnd up with these, please, four eyes follow\nPass me a bucket of ice, that's nice\nHit with the rocker, what you say proper\nI drink with the copper, show up with a chopper\nStop her, she wanna have a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\nI can tell by the bra\nDo you wish or wish upon a star?\nDo you wish or wish upon a star?\n",
