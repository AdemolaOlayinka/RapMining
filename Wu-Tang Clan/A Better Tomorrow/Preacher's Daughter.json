    "lyrics": "The only girl that could ever please me\nWas the daughter of a preacher man\n\nYo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby\nMight even make a baby, the thesis makin' her crazy\nShe know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes\nFather, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me\nBut he ain't gotta date me and look, his baby is grown\nAnd she decides on her own who resides on the throne\nI'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone\nAnd she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong\nWhen she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt\nThat's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first\nWhen opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works\nI'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse\nIt's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang\nAnd she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang\nAnd we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands\nMan, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand\n\nNo. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?\nThe preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?\nI used to see her Sundays comin' from church\nWe used to kick it at her window when her pops at work\nYo, her parents didn't play\nShe couldn't even come out to play on a school day\nThought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day\n(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)\n\nThe preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child\nShe know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul\nShe married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now\nSee her in the market place loud and boisterous\nWith tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters\nShe a seductress in the form of a goddess\nNever virtuous or modest, poison the part is\nBreakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother\nMan, that's how she molest you\nThat's why the preacher man prolly a mess too\nCause the fruit that she devourin' is evil\nNever sin around righteous people\nBlack widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you\n\n\nI met her on the bus stop with black eyes\nThat's why she said she don't fuck with black guys\nI cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom\nHer father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision\nBrutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions\nSo she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system\nThem greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet\nNever knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes\nLike, a time for peace, a time for war\nA time to laugh though, she never felt God before\nEternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk\nBetween me and her, it don't concern you\n",
