Seen the fear in yo' tears\nNow Tyrone folks is talkin', shut the fuck up here\nA product of my environment until my retirement\nHave a habit of the automatic breakin' up the static\nAnd if y'all niggaz wanna trip y'all can suck my dick\nI got eight or nine of 'em, different colors and shit\n\n\nSmell like the rain forest, got diamonds in the hood - flawless\nSable Taurus, spit a verse, no chorus\nYou're on the wrong turf, one of my songs worth\ntwo mil', eh-yo, red pill, blue pill\nStill stay focused, off-white lotus, brokers\nI'ma dead y'all slot time, no spins on the hot nine\nEh-yo, my hot nine got my whole block sign\nI rhyme gangsta, pops was an O.G.\nI'm a junior, my son'll be the third\nLet 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds (uh-huh)\nLet 'em learn degrees, the bees and the birds\n\nWhy you actin' cuckoo like you just flew over nest?\nLike I give a fuck how much weight you bench\nShyheim, my government and my attributes\nBIG left me the Tec and the nine at my crib, so Gimme the Loot\nOr L.B.C. ya like Snoop, I'm out to get coof, again coof\nTurn up the thermostat, peep the murder rap\n'Bout to bring it back, in the name of crack\nIn the name of dope\nRidin' through the hood in the Diamondback with spokes\nIn the name of thai, cliches and skunk\nI came to get high, came to get drunk\nI came with the Tec, Bobby came with the pump\nWe left with the shines, left with two dimes\nSittin' on dubs, royal flush, five of a kind\nCountin' the spare for the deuce-ooh-ooh-one\nNigga, our year, niggaz, our year\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYo, talkin' all drunk, makin' a rap right here\nFool remainders, like he can't get clapped right here\nFuck the walkin', Freemurder pack right here\nOn some napalm and bamboo track right there\nFuck twenty-five, shit, I'm strapped to the chair\nCuffie Crime Fam', my fifth black in the air\nY'all don't want none, lead ya back down the stairs\nOnce the Mac appear\nFour heat, I ain't hit 'im, shoot back fire wit 'im\nWhole empire wit 'im, never plea guilty, I ain't hit 'im\nGuess who lyin' wit 'im\nLeft po', ya dead broke like Holy's ear when Tyson bit 'im\nStill on point like lime segment\nPull out joints, the nine wet men\nDouble action, don't want no trouble, askin'\n\"Who I be?\", Murder like Tai Chi\nGet ya brain tilt\nNew Yorker, Brooklyn is where he come from\n",
