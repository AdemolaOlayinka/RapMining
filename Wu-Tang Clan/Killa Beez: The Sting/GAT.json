What?\n(Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah) Christbearer\nYe-yeah\n\nChristbearer make 'em all fall down\n'Til they kneal and get the feelin, Motherless and Heaven-bound\n(Heaven-bound)\nDon't ask me why I chase the cat\nOr do the dog-catcher with a rat 'til the dog spawn crack\nKilla Beez attack with D's on the Lex and the cleavebacks\nWith Siamese macks (Long Beach)\nNow girls, release the hounds\nWe impeach, that Caprice the ground (Yeah)\nBeat up all dragons, but we unleashin now\nRun the beast through towns 'til the beef is ground (North Star)\nNow, I've seen fire and I've seen rain\nAnd sweet baby James in the black flames\nWith the Carolina in my mind, searchin for a rhyme\nCame back with the black sunshine\nAnd fuck ya friends, all of them come and go (Yeah)\nAnd they never come to see you when ya money gets low (Low)\nThen let the record show that you could never love a ho\nIn debt to treat the baddest bitches like so-so (so-so)\nI'm from the N-O-R-T-H where niggaz is forged to G cakes\nWith the three eight's, sedate, niggaz that caught a gate (What?)\nSee people make the world rotate\nAnd I give 'em God in the flesh, the ass to test the vest\nStress and manifest success\nI make 'em all say, \"Yes\", impress and address\nThe G.P. like L.S.D. (Uh-huh)\nI'm a take you out way out (way out) where ya never been before\nInto the coke and they laid out\nHittin California corners in the legs\nHittin Tony Romma's with the police on us (on us)\n(One) And I don't give a fuck about the cops\nWith Mac in the peanut cups, spendin the high rise\n\nGangstas make the world go round (Long Beach)\nNorth town, Comp-town, puttin it down, Cali bound\nWe smoke, we joke, in the city of dogs and locs\nDon't get ya pass revoked\n\nWe smack niggaz like you and tell 'em, \"Go get ya gun\"\nAs far as I'm concerned you could suck dick and swallow cum\nI'm God-son, the rose of salvation\nProduct of the ghetto, I'm the street's creation\nI'm move like vampires, only at night\nHand grip like pliers on the glock with rapid fire\nGoin haywire, I stab a nigga 'til my arm gets tired\n\nThugz make the world go round, bloodhounds\nBody Brighton town, Now Born town\nStaple-town, Park Hill bloodhounds\nThugz make the world go round, world go round\n\nI'm Brooklyn bound, I break ya ass down\nHardcore type sound that vibrates the whole ground\nAround and around, where I stop, no one know\nBut if I'm comin ya way, best bet to get ghost\nChampagne to toast, all cheers to this host\nI rock coast to coast, any state that I approach\nWhen catch the blast of a blunt of a Philly\nI get crazy stupid, I got more bodies than Billy\nThe kid drops rhymes with a mind like Einstein\nNever the swine, I love my family cause they mine\nCheck out my shit when I slam from my lips\nIt's never no riff cause my people come thick\nIt's 12 O'Clock in effect gettin wreck\nSee I pack a Tec if some beef on ya projects\nNevertheless, I rock and roll like Elvis\nStay fresh dipped from the feet to the pelvis\nThugz make the world go round, world go round\n\nGangstas make the world go round, world go round\n\nThugz make the world go round, world go round\n\nGangstas make the world go round, world go round\n\nMeko the Pharaoh shootin down niggaz with black arrows\nA soldier from the Wild Wild West\nRollin through city streets in a North Star vest\nFunny niggaz get scared as fuck quick\nCause they man didn't learn to duck shit\nNow that nigga's duck sick, from the flick of the wick\nMedia 'vict, deep shit\nWomen and man starts to happily flip\nWhen I grab the mic grip, start tossin up shit\nY'all niggaz never thought North Stars would make it\nNow ya gettin mad when ya girl starts to shake it\nAnd Wu-Wear, the Wu-World Order\nNorth Stars wet niggaz' ass like toilet water\nCause gangstas make the world go round\nGangstas make the world go round, world go round\n\nThugz make the world go round\nThugz make the world go round, world go round\n\nGangstas make the world go round\nGangstas make the world go round, world go round\n\nThugz make the world go round\nThugz make the world go round, world go round\n\nGangstas make the world go round\nGangstas make the world go round, world go round\n\nThugz make the world go round\nThugz make the worl\n",
