Yo, yo, yo\n\nWho want me to show the reels? I do magic spells\nChildren love shootin' guns on devils kill\nI want a girl that's only too meak to squeal\nAnd Wu-Tang keep that shit concealed\nRoll with me in the drug mobile\nFuck my bitches, take it on the wheel\nPlayed it all over the world until\nWu-Tang secret now revealed\nO's is killin' all people for head over heals\nI'm not a 'ciple with +Little Rascals+\nVillians, all attracted to my shit for man silk repellent\nI'm not the well-in, white boys can't get with melon\nI'm sayin' Wu-Tang is supreme to my wife and ho bitches on tour\nTo make sure, insure, that my wife got paid while I was ditch poor\n\n\nDing dong ding, ding dong ding\nOl' Dirty Bastard squashin' shit\nComin' at ya.\n",
