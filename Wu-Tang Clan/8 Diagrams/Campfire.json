    "lyrics": "Today I'll talk about kindness\nJustice, faith, and kindness\nI want you to listen carefully\nKindness and faith, are the foundation\nWithout them, we can't become good people\nAnd with justice, we know we can lead a good life\nAnd how can I be a good man then, eh?\nHuh... well, first of all, you have to practice honesty\nMmm?\nKeep your temper, never lose control of yourself\nKeep control\nBe patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything\n\n\nOut of nowhere, there came a caravan\nThis was around a campfire light\nA lovely woman in motion\nHer hair was as dark, as the night\n\n\nCruisin on the interstate, just follow while I innovate\nToo many try and imitate, medallion like a dinner plate\nFront and get your dinner ate, chinchilla for the winter, wait\nI'm tryin to bring the \"Sexy Back\" with Timbaland and Timberlake\nSpittin like a calico, kush from a Cali hoe\nTell that joker \"tally ho\", put shots in that Denali yo\nRZA you know how we go on them 20's, that's how we roll\nAnd I don't eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though\nThe game criminal, my, my chain figaro\nMy, my dame's pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though\nUh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow\nAnd I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw\n\n\nOn anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible\nI left my chick for cheatin on me, now that bitch is miserable\nPoppin bottles, paintin hella Wallo's on my physical\nWe gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle\nPurple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl\nFuck a coma, now the state you layin is a vegetable\nYou wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable?\nYou like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...\n\n\n\n\nOnly God, has lept into avenged mind\nAnd can distinguish, good, from evil\nHa ha ha ha\n\nAiyyo Cappa!!\n\n\nWe gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out\nPreserve land, get a boat and a ranch house\nCall me a dreamer, but I hustle for real\nYou thought that I fell off but now I'm attackin the field\nAll in Chicago, grindin, puttin it down\nCrush blocks of MC's, I ain't playin around\nYo you heard me on The Bassment, givin it to 'em\nFake dudes hidin theyself, but I could see through 'em\nDiggler, what? I'm tryin to live and raise kids\nWhile you throwin up ya sign, I'm layin 'em down kid\nPlus I'm back home now, doin my thing\nThirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring\n\n\"Out of.. out of.. out of.. out of..\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good friend, holds his drink\nBad company makes bad wine!\nDrinking among friends\nRed wine means a good life\nA few drinks bring comfort\nTwo drinks are enough!\nMoney can't buy courage!\nRiches mean nothing to us!\nBrilliant, a display of genius\n",
