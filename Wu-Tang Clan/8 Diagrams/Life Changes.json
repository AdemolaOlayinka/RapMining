(bring that bucket here)\nYeah (get some ice, man, two more bottles of Cru', man, word up)\n\n\nI've gone through life pretending\nThat time will change the ending\n\n\nPeace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor\nShame On A Nigga, I heard the reaper done came to get ya\nSo I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor\nI've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas\nSome say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya\nMusic got us up off them crack corners\nNow I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty\nDamn, it's hurts me, I hate it when brother's go early\n\n\n\n\nWord to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue\nIn his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu\nUs forming like a family, you just blew\nYou was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true\nWatching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish\nYou the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed\nNow you moving more prestigious, me, hitting this reefer\nI know it's real, guess I slept with the Black Jesus\n\n\n\n\nI became weak when I heard, that his body expired\nIt was hard for me to believe my brother retired\nSuddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning\nHow can he walk off the field during the first inning?\nI cried like a baby on the way to his place of death\nHate not being there, the minutes before he left\nNow I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead\nI think about him on this song and what he might've said\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head\nI know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead\nYou crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked\nYa'll niggas shouldn't play like that, I know how you feel\nLord, but it's real, and I still can't believe\nAnd my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending\nAson Unique, loved wine and fine women\nWe singing on tour, \"ooh baby, we like it raw\" (we like it raw)\n\n\n\n\nCan't pretend...\nSome day it gotta come to an end\nBut I'ma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart\nYeah...\n\n\nI popped a bottle on your born day, God\nTried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar\nAnd I still ask, why to God, analyzing your form\nAs I stood there beside your mom\nAnd I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid\nShould've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish\nI carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me\nI really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty\n\n\n\n\nYo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through\nShout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you\nReach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races\nI dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness\nIt's all wasted, flushed down the drain and\nSoon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain and\nRivers I cried, my brother just died\nI'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side\n\n\n\n\nAh, man, how do I say goodbye?\nIt's always the good ones that have to die\nIt's hard to live without you, God, I shouldn't have doubt you\nWhen you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you\nFrom the God Mobile, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville\nFlorida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill\nYou interrupt the Grammy's said \"Wu for the kids\"\nTook four or five shots when they rushed in the crib\nTrey-five-seven cracked ya ribs, cops shot ya whip\nYou've been chased by the pigs, sold the four year bid\nCrashed cars, still came out without a scar\nThey tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar\nSo you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world\nWho's who and what's what, and probably go nuts\nHow we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?\nWe fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt\n\n\n\n\nBut those mistakes behind me\nCast shadows to remind me\n",
