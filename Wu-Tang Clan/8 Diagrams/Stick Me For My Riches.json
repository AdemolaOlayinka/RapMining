I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh\nFight to stay alive\n\n\nI was raised out on these mean streets\nYou know where poverty and hell meet\nBrothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap\nSince momma held me, in her arms, to tell me\nThat it's a cold world, I done held heat\nAnd held myself down, lotta bodies and shells found\nAnd niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down\nWe fell down, ain't hard to tell now\nI ain't trying, to see the cell now\nor see momma put her house up for bail now\nSo I'mma give all I got, to try and get that gwop\nNigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops\nI use my talent to get more figures\nUnlike these little corner store niggas\nGo change your drawers, niggas\n\n\nNow with success and I've become a target\nThey wanna set me up, take me hostage, or take me down some notches\nThey wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches\nThey wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches\n\n\nAnd I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...\n(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)\nYeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...\n(Face it, money is power and I'ma make it)\nI'm gonna make it... oooh...\n\n\nYeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, aiyo\nN.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops\nFew rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked\nFishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop\nNew guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots\nPregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems\nSo hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon\nI got mouths to feed, I got pounds of weed\nI need some more, another store, another house, indeed\nAn X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze\nAnd strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's\nDon't ever doubt a G, and have me spaz like\n'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery\nIt ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within\nThat won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G\n\n\nNow with success and I've become a target\nThey wanna set me up, take me hostage, or take me down some notches\nThey wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches\nThey wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches\n\n\nAnd I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...\n(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)\nYeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...\n(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)\n\n\nAiyo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck, Ghost and Chef be cashing checks\nKilla, Cap be snapping necks, Street and 'Zilla flash the tech\nSacrifice a savage life, if he trying to bag my ice\nTag a price on merchandise, tell me, is it worth ya life?\n\n\nNo... it's a cold, cold, cold world\nYou can't be playing games with my life\nI've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive\n\n\nAiyo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night\nTrying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight\nMajor business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life\nSlice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like\n\n\nAiyo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, fuck the bacon\nEarthquaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking\nTimes are hard, sew a job, scheming niggaz wanna rob\nUse a hoe to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs\nStab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while\nHating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style\nHold you for a ransom note, Goliath cutting David's throat\nGrab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float\n\n\nNow with success and I've become a target\nThey wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems\nThey wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches\nThey wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches\n\n\nAnd I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...\nYeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...\nIt's a cold, cold, cold world\nI got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run\nYeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world\nYou can't be playing games with my life\nI've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive\nThis ain't a game, this is my life\nKeep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back\nAnd you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that\nWhen ya laid down, laid flat...\n",
