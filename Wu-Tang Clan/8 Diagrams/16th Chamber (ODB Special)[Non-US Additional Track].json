Niggaz think they bigga\nBecause they got the finga on the trigga of a biscuit\nThey don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it\nWith the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic\nBetter yet a Snapple, nigga want the juice\nBut he don't want the hassle\nThought they trying to overthrow the castle\nBetter yet the temple, I'm comin to your town\nBlack down, the rental, car, the pistol\nYAH! If you don't want a burn from glock\nThen beware, I buck shots, meaning what, the buck stops\nHere, no more dough will be made\nUnless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh\n\n\nChamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four\nTemple number nine, temple number nine\n\n\nI'm the original G-O-D\nMaking young ladies scream is my specialty\nwhen I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype\nFrom the funky fresh music that was stereotyped\nWhen I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow\nNot sayin Ason, is like a duck of disco\nOr a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop\nYo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...\nWu-Tanging, flipping the script and\nYou could test my skills, but niggaz must be trippin\nCoked up from sniffin, you're the one who's riffin\nI'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith\nYou start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin\nWhile you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen\nAs I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show\nStrip or rip a hoe, ready like Bo\nJackson while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin\nRelaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and\nAgain and again when I rock this jam\nI wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand\nIntroducin, the one-man band\nA child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand\nNiggaz wanna jump, then stepped, to the center\nOf the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor\nYou get jacked and slapped, across the MC map\nI laugh at ya ass, on a horse shack\nCome on through I black and blue your whole crew\nThen I get rudie with the Hong Kong Phooey\nThe Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer\nMoney maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style\nThat I lay down like tile\nGotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...\n",
