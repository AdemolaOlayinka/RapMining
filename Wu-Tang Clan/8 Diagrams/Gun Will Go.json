Fiends waiting to smoke some\nApproach something, ask him where he getting that coke from\nMy dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun\nCuz no V and no ones, equalling no fun\nWho want a treat they know, huh? Body to go numb\nMy woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done\nIt is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow\nThat make it hard to get dough, the harder to get gold\nHarder the piff blow, harder when it snow\nThe pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for\nGet gwop, then get low, but first thought\nWe gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss\nYeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no\nHustling from the get-go, the motto is get more\n\n\n\n\nWe was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along\nWith the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate\nTook case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?\nPut ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped\nWe get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn\nAnd it's a no win situation fucking with them\nYou mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch\nMillion dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust\nTrust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper\nDamaging lyrical mass destruction launcher\nNothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid\nPeace to my brothers up north, doing state bids\n\n\n\n\nWhoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club\nYou know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs\nThe gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go\nThe gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go\nThe gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go\n\n\nWe got butter...\n",
