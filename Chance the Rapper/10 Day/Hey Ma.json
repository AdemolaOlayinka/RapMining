Rose, was practicing his free-throws\nShout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro\nShout out that Ms. Moody, auntie Toni them my heroes\n\nWe gon' get this paper, put that on my mama\nYou gon' see us later, put that on my mama\nMonica and Ava, thanks for all the favors\nGot my money saved up, put that on my mama\n\nHey Ma, hey Ma I know I never did behave a lot\nNever got good grades a lot\nAnd turned your hairs to grays a lot\nAnd go in stores and take a lot\nAnd never shopped but saved a lot\nSo you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot\nAnd you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot\nThey playing with your checks, your shit\nCause they gonna take your pay or not\nQue Sera gotta then, fuck them niggas you smarter than\nWe just gonna beg your pardon them\nSave Money, my partner and them\nI'm part of them, It's part of me\nThis Save Mula, Bo Squarter III\nI'm riding around my side of town\nHot boxing no cops around\nI had the tux I had the gown\nJust had a show, just had to bounce\nIt's Chance ho, #10Day\nChano no hable englais\nThat language be that chanish but ooh! Muy caliente\nSo she just gonna throw her steps on\nAnd haters gonna throw that epsom\nAnd we just gonna throw a party\nAnd I'm gonna just throw my teflon\nCause family be that plug though\nAnd I ain't even flexin\nBut twin bro be that Victor\nAnd Big Cause be that Chef Sean\n\nI said don't stop, in what you be\nIn what you do, don't stop\n\n\nAyo I wanna thank, MC Tree mama\nI wanna thank Fox mama, I wanna thank Robbie mama\nLili mama, Peter mama\nMY mama, my dad mama\nYour mama, I wanna thank moms\nI wanna thank, L-Boog mama, I wanna thank Tom Fool mama\nI wanna thank, Talent mama, Marcus mama\nI wanna thank, Thelonious mama, Vic mama, Reese mama\nI just wanna, I wanna thank anybody whose been a mother to a motherless child\nI love you mommy\n10Day\nI hope y'all had a good time\nAgh!\n",
