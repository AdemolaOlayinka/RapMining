Or you just wasn't thinking?\nI'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink!\nI hear you're pockets jingling, it's calling me like ring, ring!\nI'll choke you with your bling bling, then run faster than Tink Tink\nAnd all these goofies mad though, like, \"Why he such a asshole?\"\nAnd I ain't even mad yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver\nThat shit ain't even rhyme nigga, I'm fucked up out my mind nigga\nI stay right off the '9 nigga, that's where they try an' find a nigga\nFeeling froggy? Better timid up, harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt\nCause niggas don't wanna get bended up, stay talking but don\u2019t send it up\nUsed to send it up for my skinner lunch\nSave money niggas really won't spend a buck\nGimme that cash, that ben what up\nPockets keep that denim bruh like\nFuck you tahm bout?...\nNigga, fuck you tahm bout?...\n",
