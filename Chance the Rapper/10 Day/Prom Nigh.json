    "lyrics": "Charlie Bartlett, John Bender\nClass Switcher, Time Bender\nChance Bennett a peculiar name\nGraduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name\nYou made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job\nWe was all outcasts only listened to Good Mob\nI performed at fun fair\nFun fact, I'm never going back to school\nBeen there, done that\nThey see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps\nDon't call it impossible, if you really want that\nThey send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback\nI just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back\nChano y tequila you know you know you don't want that\nI rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps\nWrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped\nAs if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap\nYo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?\nNow I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping\nI should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening\nI just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain\nIt's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking\nSip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing\nFuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham\nUntil the day they said I would have to chat without em\nAnd I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right\nHere's a brighter bulb for your limelight\nAnd this is your night, homie, shine bright\nThis for everybody's fucking prom night\n\nAnd it's alright\nAnd it's ok\nAnd we're all good\nWe're with homies\nAny problems, you can call us\nIt's all love, it's all love\n\nUh, yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo\nThese pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go\nSo pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo and snap a couple candid's of the family\nGet some cameos\nYou can change the clocks but you can't change hours\nI'm waiting on the day, Spring can't bring flowers\nLet me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours\nAnd pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers\nAnd hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy\nThe hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely\nSo go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty\nThis to a moment's glimpse at royalty\nThis is for my momma Jan who spoiled me\nLook what we've accomplished\nTime flies, watches look like magnets on a compass\nBefore we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo\nBumping 10 Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo\nAnd rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping\nAnd damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened\nBut it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin\nI did a show at AKIN and I would do it again\n\n\nLook at, look at your business tux, all night airplane\nGo and get your racist on, all white everything\nI'm on my paper now, put that on my heading\nI ain't even write this down I don't write errthing\nI know y'all don't like everything\nShe want a night she can call her wedding\nGiving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches\nNose diving, going all night sledding\nCoked out like \"Don't change when you grow up\nI hope you get some change when you blow up\"\nCause honestly I've always loved the way you could throw up\nRest up on my shoulder, float up flying lotus\n\"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda\nYou deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa\nYou deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara\nAnd a hand to wipe away all that running mascara\"\nBut I, I want to thank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nThank you for this prom night\nI really enjoyed my prom night\n\n\nSo good, So right\nHey baby, so good, so right\nYou know it feels so good\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\nSo good, so right\nTo be with you tonight\n",
