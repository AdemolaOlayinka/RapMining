Merry Christmas Lil' Mama
2016
Bongo by the way
I know you don't wanna be by yourself
Got who you want around
I know I'm not that nigga that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where were you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, telling you
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, he's playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
(My Xmas at home)
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby

Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, he's playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone
We should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Aunty Cam an all of them
And they act like Maury
They say "where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like 
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some "don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby
