Chance the Rapper
Merry Christmas Lil' Mama
2016
Snow's in the air
Tree everywhere
Wind from the lake
Something in the air
Christmas is here
Bring your lady, chill
Zero below
Only in the 
Pretty ring, I know
But she hit the phone
Just what she own
Saw her on the streets
Timbs on my feet
Best time to give
Chi-Town it is
Fam all around
Trying to run the town
Love how it smells
Bucket full of wings
Trying to give about five golden rings
Balling for the chill's
Drinks on, get your smoke on
When I break, no school zone
Footwork, yeah, get your step on on
Merry, merry Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest

Jeremih on the beat
Lighting up a tree
7 nominees
I cannot believe
Pray for '79th
Pray for '79th
For a city all the way to over East
Now I'm flying in
Where you wanna land?
Million pair again
Big frost bucks
Baby, finna hit the plaza
Grab a couple plasma's
You don't want no athsma
Hot sauce on my wings
Nights at the rink
These are a few of my fav things

Merry, merry Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town Christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
