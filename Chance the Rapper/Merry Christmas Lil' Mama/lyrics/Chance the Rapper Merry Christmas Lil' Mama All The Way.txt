And your presence is a present for me
For Christmas or just because
It's either your love or none at all
Either your love or none at all

Oh, I love Christmas
Being obligated to buy shit for people at a certain time in the year
I buy Christmas gifts, but just, just 'cause you're supposed to
Jesus
Autotune that for me
Jesus

Jesus' Birthday
I swear to God if you leave my raw vocals like that
We not friends anymore
Autotune my shit and put them, put them Travis Scott effects on my shit
