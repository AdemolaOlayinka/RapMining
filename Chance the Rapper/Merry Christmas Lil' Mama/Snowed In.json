Come slide\nI could really use a ride\nWhen the Uber has arrived\nI won't even come inside\nI just wanna catch a ride\nRoll a wood, catch a vibe\nWe could have a silent night\nLong as I'm up by your side\n\nYou won't need them boots or the furs\nGive it to you proper, yes sir\nStay the night, baby here's a shirt\n(I just need you next to me)\nLet's get close and blame it on the weather\nGirl you know you deserve so much better\nLet's make a snowman and ball together\n(Every year on Christmas eve)\nNow we ain't got to hit the club\nKnow you cold, lets bundle up\nI'm just tryna get some love\nI hope it wasn't obvious\nIt's a white Christmas at the crib\nTryna get snowed in\nI'm gon unwrap you while we lay\nGo and show me what it is\nNow we ain't got to hit the club\nKnow you cold, lets bundle up\nI'm just tryna get some love\nI hope it wasn't obvious\nIt's a white Christmas at the crib\nTryna get snowed in\nI'm gon unwrap you while we lay\nGo and show me what it is\nGirl, you saying that's fresh\nTell me how you like my Santa hat\nGood times that's how we take it back\nup in a bag\nI make her scream I'm Mr. Felcher\nYeah, while she cooking Hamburger Helper\nShe on the pole she Santa's helper\n\nIt ain't nothing no-one can tell her\nHey lil mama in the pink\nYou would look good in a mink\nThey all say the same thing\nAll my exes say jinx\nWhat you want, tryna\nWho are you tryin to bring\nThey ain't even gotta change\nLet her jingle in her jeans\n\nNow we ain't got to hit the club\nKnow you cold, lets bundle up\nI'm just tryna get some love\nI hope it wasn't obvious\nIt's a white Christmas at the crib\nTryna get snowed in\nI'm gon unwrap you while we lay\nGo and show me what it is\n(Girl you slay, I love her)\nNow we ain't got to hit the club\nKnow you cold, lets bundle up\n(Baby you slay, I love her)\nI'm just tryna get some love\nI hope it wasn't obvious\n(Girl you slay, I love her)\nIt's a white Christmas at the crib\nTryna get snowed in\n(baby you slay, I love her)\nI'm gon unwrap you while we lay\nGo and show me what it is\n(Girl you slay, I love her)\n(Baby you slay, I love her)\n(Girl you slay, I love her)\n(Baby you slay, I love her)\n",
