No dap, but I'll take a pound or two\nNo doubt like Gwen Stefani's group\nLet me put my mouth where you potty, boo\n(IGH!)\nThem niggas pissed, need potty training\nThey movement shit, that's a potty train\nShe ain't left yet, but she probably came\nWe kicked it then I score, soccer game\nShe was a phony goalie\nI got great aim though, don't insult me\nI'll give it to ya straight, this is what she told me\nMy name Solo cause I'm the one and only\nShe only got you as a nigga on the side\nThat's a nigga on the side of a side bitch, homie\nThen we got out a Dodge, like them Dukes of Hazzard\nMusic and tabs of Lucy, take your chance with this rapper\n",
