Keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro\nOr he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi\nWiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote\nIf I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outtie\nPull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie\nI just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky\nTonight she just yelling \"Fuck me\"\nTwo weeks she'll be yelling fuck me\nUsed to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie\nAnd Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me\nPut Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me\nOh generation above me, I know you still remember me\nMy afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting (BLAM!)\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses\n\nI will smoke a little something but I don't inhale\nEverywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking hows it going\nSay the goings well\nGo figure, Victor's light skinned, Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell\nAll praise to the God, God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL\nCheck, check mate, check me, take me to the bedroom, let you know me well\nI mean normally, you see, Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil\nBut these kids these days they get so high, burn trees, smoke Chlorophyll\n'Til they can't feel shit, shit faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L\nElevated, train, and the craziest thing, got me feeling like Lauryn Hill\nMiseducated, my dick delegated, rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it\nProbably shoulda been dead or in jail\nDeadbeat dad, enough of that jazz, asshole, absinthe up in that class\nAre we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong, we're brain dead, take a tug and then pass\nI think we all addicted,\nYeah, I think we all addicted\nReally though, I think we all addicted\nI think we addicted\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I think we all addicted\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses\n\nI could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter\nTwo seats used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi\nTrying hard not to be addicted to a groupie\nI ended up on an album cover in a Coogi\nYou see, I be still a God but a goofy\nYou be flowing out by trucks in a Uzi\nThat's the new principle, sometimes I'm a be about some ho\nSometimes I'm a wanna make a movie\nAnd when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson\nAnd though my style freakish\nI could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron\nCause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG\nKnow me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see\nNever scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics\nCooler like I'm offa codeine, low key\nDon't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing\nIf I don't know what I miss is\nI'm a end up figuring out that it's home\nAnd my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses\nThis is just a testament to the ones that raised me\nThe ones that I praise and I'm thanking\nI need em but the chronic all up in my clothes\nAnd I wanna get a hug, and I can't cause I'm stanking\nNever too old for a spanking\n\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my memories, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I think we all addicted\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses\nCigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank\nI got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank\nI miss my cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses\n",
