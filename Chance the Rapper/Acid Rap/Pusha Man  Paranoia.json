They deserted us here\nWhere the fuck is Matt Lauer at? Somebody get Katie Couric in here\nProbably scared of all the refugees, look like we had a fucking hurricane here\nThey be shooting whether it's dark or not, I mean the days is pretty dark a lot\nDown here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot\nNo love for the opposition, specifically a cop position,\nCause they've never been in our position\nGetting violations for the nation, correlating, you dry snitching\n\n\nI know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.\nI know you scared, me too.\nI know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.\nIf you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.\n\nIt just got warm out, this this shit I've been warned about.\nI hope that it storm in the morning, I hope that it's pouring out.\nI hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks.\nAnd I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dying first.\nCause everybody dies in the summer.\nWanna say ya goodbyes, tell them while it's spring.\nI heard everybody's dying in the summer, so pray to God for a little more spring.\nI know you scared, you should ask us if we scared, too.\nIf you was there, then we just knew you'd care, too.\n",
