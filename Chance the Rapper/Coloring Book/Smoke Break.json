When did we buy a bowl?\n\nWe just be smoking a bowl\nWe ain't got no time to roll\nI'm always out on the road\nShe don't got time for a whole\nLittle bit of time that we have\nWe used to purchase a half\nThere don't be no time to smoke\nI'm always throwing on clothes\nShe always throwing a fit\nWe don't got no time for no sex\nI just put milk in the bowl\nShe don't be cooking at all\nShe just put weed in the bowl\nShe don't have time for herself\nShe putting points on the board, yes\nYou know she carry her own\nYou know she carry a child\nShe wake up at crack of dawn\nShe don't be cracking a smile\nSo when she packing the bowl\nI grab her, I tell her...\n\nLet me crack this blunt\nSlow it down for a second\nBreak it down oh\nShe said, \"let me lick this blunt\"\nSlow it down for a second\nBreak it down oh\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\n\nTruth being told, we used to movies and bowl\nWe used to Netflix and roll\nI used to pass her the smoke\nShe used to laugh at my jokes\nYou pat my back when I choke\nWish we were stuck in our ways\nWe way too young to get old\nWe stuck together like oowops\nWe smoked a fatty sing Zoo-Wap\nTraphouse 3, Guwop\nI shoulda knew when I grew up\nIt would be no time at all\nWe went from White Owls to Raws\nWe went from joints to a bowl\nShe need a second to breathe\nWe need an actual smoke sesh\n\nLet me crack your back\nSlow it down for a second\nTake it down oh\nLet me run this back\nSlow it down for a minute\nYou deserve, you deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\n\nI don't have time to finesse\nI put some ice on your neck\nBut I ain't holding your back\nI spend my time on the road\nSuper ain't saving no hoes\nI don't have time to patrol\nLet me break these bales right down for a second\nWhen it touch down oh\nI got to lay back the roof\nI got to break the new rules\nShe can't be taking no cost\nWhen she involved with a boss\nPlease don't get lost in the sauce\nPlease don't get lost in the sauce\nShe been like this from the door\nTold me my mom was a whore\nI gave her percs for myself\nI give a perc full of steam\nI'm tryna crown me a queen\nYou hear the chains when they cling\nI take the molly its clean\nI push the whip with the wings\nI gotta be oversea, I gotta be on the pedal\nI push it down to the floor\nI got designer galore\nI keep some Goyard and geuss\nI smoke out all of my cars\nYou smell the weed in the air\nYou smell the smoke in the seats\nYou went and had our child\nYou didn't abandon the D\nYou got me twisted at least\nYou can...\n\nLet me crack your back\nLet me rub you all over\nTake it down oh\nLet me make this blunt\nMake you dinner or somethin'\nYou deserve, you deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\nWe deserve, we deserve\nWe deserve, we deserve\nA smoke break\n",
