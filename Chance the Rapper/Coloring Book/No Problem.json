What you thinkin'?\nFuck you thought it was?\nI just popped five percocets and only caught a buzz\nAnd if that label try to stop me\nThere gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby\nMula, baby\n\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nJust another day, had to pick up all the mail\nThere go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, \"There he go!\"\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me, bih!\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nJust another day, had to pick up all the mail\nThere go Chano ridin' through the streets, they be like, \"There he go!\"\n\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nYou don't want no problems, want no problems with me\nSay so, got problems, say so\nThey be like, \"There he go! \"\n",
