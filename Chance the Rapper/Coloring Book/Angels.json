And who the fuck is you? And who is him?\nAll of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me\nNa, na, na, na I got angels\nI got angels\nI ain't change my number since the seventh grade\nThis for my day one, ten years, seven days\nA week, nigga's never tired on they Kevin Gates\nAnd if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates\nIt's too many young angels on the southside\nGot us scared to let our grandmommas outside\nYou gonna make me take the campers way downtown\nYou gonna make me turn my BM to my housewife\nI just had a growth spurt\nIt done took so long, my tippy toes hurt\nYou can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search\nI'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch\nGrandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture\nGCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live\nPower 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke\nGCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live\nPower 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke\n\nThey was talking \"woo woo this woo wap da bam\"\nCity so damn great, I feel like Alexand'\nWear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion\nI got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded\nWap the bam (na, na, na)\n(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded\n(Na, na, na)\n(I got angels)\nThey was talking \"woo woo this woo wap da bam\"\nCity so damn great, I feel like Alexand'\nWear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion\nI got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded\nWho is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?\nAll of the sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me\nNa, na, na, na I got angels\nI got angels\nNa, na\nNa, na\nI got, I got\n",
