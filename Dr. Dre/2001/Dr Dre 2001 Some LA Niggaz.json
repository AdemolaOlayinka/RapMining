You gotta recognize\nL.A. niggaz, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga\nRecognize this\n\nNow in my younger days I used to sport a rag\nBackpack full of cans plus a four-four mag\nG'd from the feet up\nBlued up from the Zoo, a pi' grew up\nLoc'n, smokin and drinkin til we threw up (threw up)\nAt Leimert Park, taggin, hittin fools up\nDitchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up\nYou don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up\nBut don't sleep, y'all niggaz quick to shoot you\nNow there's another motherfucker with no future\nBut Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba\nGot em jumpin\n\nI'm comin \"Straight Outta Compton\" with a loose cannon\nSmoke big green, call it Bruce Banner\nWatch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch\nFrom way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha\nPicture this, Dr. Dre twistin with Tha Liks\nAnd Hittman bought a fix\nDon't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch\nHere it tick tick tick tick (BOOM)\nWait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic\nWeed and cocaine sold seperate, check it\nFrom sundown to sunup - clown done run up\nThe Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?\n\nWe roll deep, smoke on weed drink and back heat\nRequirements for survival each day - in L.A.!\nIt don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops\nAnalyze why we act this way - in L.A.!\n\nGimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move\nThey call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do\nCock me back\nBust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax\nWho used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true\nBut I grew up where niggaz jack you, harass you\nBlast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)\nMash on you for your turkish chain, C.K. B.K.\nBlued up or flame, I ran with a gang\nI helped niggaz get, jacked for they Dana Dane's\nMy pants hang below my waistline\nI look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)\nI bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline\nDon't waste my time\nFuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's\nOne-time's, sunshines, and fine-ass bitches\nHawaiian thai, drive-by, six-fo's on switches\n\nI was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'\nWhere the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood\nSlugs for the fuck of it\nAnybody hatin on us can suck a dick\nIf I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor\nBetter than yours, drivin away gettin head from a whore\nIt's AvireX-to-the-Z\nFuckin with me might get you banned from TV,\nCassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time\nMultiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie\nWhat, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health\nLike puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself\n\nFive in the mornin, burglars at my do'\nGlock forty-five in my dresser drawer\nLet em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll\nRoll with niggaz, who by fifths by the fo'\nAnd bruise by the case\nSLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced\nLikwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings\nHaters fold the style, but can't find no openings\n\n\nIn L.A.\nThat's how we ride\n",
