(The watcher)\n\n\nEverywhere that I go\nAin't the same as befo' (The watcher)\nPeople I used to know\nJust don't know me no more (The watcher)\nBut everywhere that I go\nI got people I know (The watcher)\nWho got people they know\nSo I suggest you lay low (I watch)\n\n\nI moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?\nNiggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be.\nBut niggas can't hit niggas they can't see.\nI'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach.\nHow would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?\nYou'd probably move to a new house on a new hill.\nAnd choose a new spot if niggas wanted you shot,\nI ain't a thug, how much Tupac in you, you got\nI ain't no bitch neither.\nIt's either my life or your life,\nAnd I ain't leaving, I like breathing.\nNigga we can go round for round,\nClip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound.\nNigga if you really want to take it there we can,\nJust remember that you fucking with a family man.\nI got a lot more to lose than you, remember that,\nWhen you wanna come and fill these shoes. (The watcher)\n\n\n\n\nThings just ain't the same for gangstas,\nCops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs.\nThey wanna hang us, see us dead, enslave us,\nKeep us trapped in the same place we're raised in.\nThen they wonder why we act so outrageous,\nRun around stressed out and pull out gauges.\nCause everytime you let the animal out cages,\nIt's dangerous to people who look like strangers.\nBut now we got a new era of gangstas,\nHustlers and youngsters living amongst us.\nLookin at us, now calling us busters,\nCan't help but reminisce back when it was us.\nNigga we started this gangsta shit.\nAnd this the motherfucking thanks I get?\nIt's funny how time fly,\nI'm just having fun, just watching it fly by. (The watcher)\n\n\n\n(The watcher)\n",
