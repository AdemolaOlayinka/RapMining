BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\n\n\nEveryday it's the same thang, L.A. ain't changed\nNiggaz still playa hatin, but Dre ain't changed\nI'm just a lot smarter now\ncause these niggaz is bangin ten times harder now\nNiggaz ringin they ass up in the wrong part of town\nBetter turn they car around\nRollin the window down (Em: Hey can we talk it out?)\n(Hitt: NAH GET THE FUCK OUT!)\nJohnny got a shotgun\nand he ain't even strong enough to cock one\nFuck tryin to job hunt\nNiggaz got AK's, niggaz is way crazier\nthan Dre was back in his N.W.A. days\nNiggaz spray strays and shoot without lookin\nNiggaz walk by and blast without leavin a footprint\nI think the attitudes are twice as worst\nIt takes half the time to get your life reversed\nAlways tryin to play Rambo with they ammo\nMake a nigga wanna stay in family mode\n\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!!\n\n\nLate nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by\nMurder arrives, anytime\nBullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites\nSome hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light\nput you in the site of youngsters with automatics\nBustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates\nThese days, gun play is official with green lights on every block\nKnow the sign tells you too it's not best to stop\nOn every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin\nYou'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's\nMakin death not so foreign to ya\nNiggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough,\nammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese\nI've learned to stay away from house parties\nI've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin\nAin't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on\nNights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn\n\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\n\n\nNow tell me - what the fuck is this man?\nNiggaz doin brothers in worse than the Klan\nCan't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill\nwithout yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill\nblood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs\nfillin the sky, usually drillin the one\nthat wasn't willin to die, yes sir in the Killing Field\nI got my, life preserver\nAnd I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to\nquestion me - bout the colors that I got on?\nNow see that red dot on your knot\nBout to get your whole crew shot on\nA Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on\nTook him out on the spot before he even got on\nmy hitlist -- peep this\nI cock back, you bow down\nBust round, bloody the ground, retaliation sounds like this\n\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nEverywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\nNo matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is\nBANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!\n",
