    "lyrics": "Ya'll know me still the same OG\nBut I been low key\nHated on by most these niggas\nWith no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys\nNo boats, no snowmobiles and no skis\nMad at me cause\nI can finally afford to provide my family with groceries\nGot a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks\nTo add to the wall full of plaques\nHanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies\nBut ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze\nHo Please\nYou better bow down on both knees\nWho you think taught you to smoke trees?\nWho you think brought you the oldies?\nEazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C's, the Snoop D O double G's\nAnd a group that said motherfuck the police?\nGave you a tape full of dope beats\nTo bump when stroll through in your hood\nAnd when your album sales wasn't doing too good\nWho's the doc that they told you to go see?\nYa'll better listen up closely\nAll you niggas that said that I turned pop\nOr the Firm flopped\nya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep\nSo fuck ya'll all of ya'll\nIf ya'll don't like me blow me\nYa'll are gonna keep fucking around with me\nAnd turn me back to the old me\n\nNowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say\nBut nothing comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\n\nSo what do you say to somebody you hate?\nOr anyone tryna bring trouble your way?\nWanna resolve things in a bloodier way\nJust study your tape of NWA.\nOne day I was walking by\nWith a Walkman on\nWhen I caught a guy give me an awkward eye (what you looking at?)\nAnd strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani\nI don't give a fuck if it's dark or not\nI'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge\nBut I'm drunk as fuck\nRight next to a humongous truck in a two car garage\nHopping out with two broken legs tryna walk it off\nFuck you too, bitch, call the cops\nI'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfucking barking dogs\nAnd when the cops came through\nMe and Dre stood next to a burnt down house\nWith a can full of gas and a hand full of matches\nAnd still weren't found out (Right Here)\nso from here on out it's the Chronic 2\nStarting today and tomorrow's the new\nAnd I'm still loco enough\nTo choke you to death with a Charleston chew\nSlim shady hotter than a set of twin babies\nIn a Mercedes Benz with the windows up\nAnd the temp goes up to the mid 80's\nCalling men ladies\nSorry Doc but I been crazy\nThere is no way that you can save me\nIt's OK go with him Hailie (Dadda?)\n\n\nIf it was up to me\nYou motherfuckers would stop coming up to me\nWith your hands out looking up to me\nLike you want something free\nWhen my last CD was out you wasn't bumping me\nBut now that I got this little company\nEverybody wanna come to me like it was some disease\nBut you won't get a crumb from me\nCause I'm from the streets of Compton\nI told 'em all\nAll them little gangstas\nWho you think helped mold 'em all\nNow you wanna run around and talk about guns\nLike I ain't got none\nWhat you think I sold 'em all\nCause I stay well off\nNow all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off\nWhat, cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad\nTryna get this damn label off\nI ain't having that\nThis is the millennium of Aftermath\nIt ain't gonna be nothing after that\nSo give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap\nYou can have it back\nSo where's all the mad rappers at?\nIt's like a jungle in this habitat\nBut all you savage cats\nKnew that I was strapped with gats\nWhen you were cuddling a cabbage patch\n",
