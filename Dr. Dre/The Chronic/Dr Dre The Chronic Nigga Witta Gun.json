You do in...\nGoddamn, 'cause it's the city.\nAnd for a youth to survive a nigga gotta be a gangster.\nAnd I'm a nigga you can't remove.\nTook out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove\nTo their homies they can hang by dealin' with me.\nBut once again in the end they D-E-A-D.\nI never did time on a murder yet.\n'Cause I relax and back do a job and jet.\nYo, I know you understand my flow,\nSo here we go when Death Row\nCome. Let a motherfucker know...\n\n\nD-R-E! A motherfucker who's known for carryin' gats\nAnd kick raps that make snaps.\nAdapts to anything violent that I'm located at.\nIf you see me on the solo moves believe that I'm strapped.\n44, .38 or AK 47.\n'Cause Mo' live with Charlie Sheen.\nYou want a stairway to heaven?\nJust put my finger on the trigger and pull back\nAnd lay a punk motherfucker flat.\nAs he wonder what popped before he got popped,\nI told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop.\nNow I know you understand my flow,\nSo here we go when Death Row\nCome. Let a motherfucker know...\n\n\nI break some off. I break some off.\nYeah, I break some off. I break some off.\nYeah, I break some off.\nBut I ain't speakin' about between the thighs.\nI'm talkin' about cockin' a guage in between your eyes.\nThat'll make you drop to your knees, 'cause you realise\nThat a gat will make any nigga civilised.\nOld buster ass nigga talkin' bullshit.\nDon't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with.\nGet lit or hit up by the doctor.\nA nigga to break some off properly.\nReal G.\nSo don't doubt it.\nI'm the one who's doin' it\nWhile these other niggas talk about it.\nAnd if motherfuckers come at me wrong\nI straight put my 44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome.\nAnd show him why they call me the notorious one.\nThe name is Dre, Eastwood when I'm packin' a gun.\nYou don't believe me, wanna step up and give it a try.\nAnd if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die.\nBut some still don't hear me though.\nYou're too ninny not to hear me nigga, yo.\nSo now you know...\n",
