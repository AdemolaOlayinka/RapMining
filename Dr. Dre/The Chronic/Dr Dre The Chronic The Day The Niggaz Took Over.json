If you ain't down for the\nones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit. Devil you need to\nstep your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in\nand start puttin some funk in that ass\n\n\n\nBreak em off sometin\n\n\n\nI got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why\nBut livin in the city it's do-or-die\n\n\n\n\nThey wonder where me bailin and don't really understand\nThe reason why they take me life and me ???? hand\nMe not out for peace and me not Rodney King\nMe gun goes click, me gun goes bang\nThem riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach\nThem rion in they Lakers and don't really wanna see\nniggaz start to loot and police start to shoot\nLock it down at seven o'clock, then again it's like Beirut\nMe don't show no love cuz it's us against them\nThem never ever love me cuz it's sport to break de,\nand kill at my own risk if I may\nDelay to spray with my AK and put it to rest\n\n\n\nYes we have. There have been riots, ahh, rioting, well I don't wanna say\nrioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want\nto show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street\n\n\n\nHow many niggaz are ready to lose?\nYeah, so what you wanna do?\nWhat you wanna do?\nI said how many niggas are ready to lose\nGot myself an Uzi and my brother a 9\n\n\n\nNobody told us today, in otherwords,\nYou're still a slave. No matter how\nmuch money you got, you still ain't shit\n\n\n\nSittin in my livin room calm and collected\nFeelin mad, gotta get mine respected\ncuz what I just heard broke me in half\nand half the niggaz I know, plus the niggaz on the Row, is bailin\nLaugh now but cry much later\nYa see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us\nLike my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles\nThey find that they couldn't handle us\nBloods, Crips on the same squad\nwith the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob\n(And break the white man off somthin lovely, biddy-bye-bye\nI don't love dem so they can't love me)\nYo straight puttin down gettin my scoot on\nLet's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on\nand come up on me some furniture or sometin\nGot a VCR\nin the back of my car\nthat I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet\nAnd motherfuckers better not try to stop me\nCuz they will see that I can't be stopped\nCuz I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop\n\n\n\nThere has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd\nthrowin things at the officers\nAnd swingin at them as well. Like there was a young woman there. You see\nshe took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand\n\n\n\nHow many niggaz are ready to lose?\nYeah, so what you wanna do?\nWhat you wanna do?\nI said how many niggas are ready to lose\nGot myself an Uzi and my brother a 9\n\n\n\nI got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why\nBut livin in the city it's do-or-die\n\n\n\n\nOne-time trigger happy, no nigga love\n187 time, time to grab the glove\nCan't get prints so a 9 I throw away\nor get prints so my Uzi witta spray\nPOP POP POP another motherfucker drop\nAnd I get relived like *?Bop Bop says?*\nsmash, I crashed his head like a window\nI ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo\nCreepin with the quickness to the cut\nBust one to his head while he munches on that donut\nAnd cracker so now he best to back up\nI guess I gots ta pack up, fillin the clip up, I zip up-\ntown, the motherfuckin cops are all around\nHelicopters flyin\nThese motherfuckers tryin\nto catch me and stretch me on Death Row\nbut hell no's the poor black refuse to go\n\n\n\nThis is now coverin a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these\nfires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south\nend of South Central is a long way\n\n\n\nBreak em off sometin\n\n\n\nThe outcome of this is destruction so the more fall\nNiggaz don't give a fuck so tem bust and before\nniggaz backin up three black shows\nNo justice so they copied ya right\nand here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me\nBe too many wigs got me 9 to my tights\nso me bust, flick cuz he don't give a fuck\nand me don't give a fuckin of my problems\nIn with their FUCK FUCK\n\n\n\nBlak blam, blam to dem fall\nListen to the shots from my nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye\nDr Dre him bust gun shots\nDiggity Daz and RBX them bust gun shots\nCome again!\n",
