(Let's make a million)\nM-E-L-Man, niggas call me Most\nI be rockin on the East and the West Coast\nYour mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline\nWith Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins\nThis shit be on my mind like O'Donnells interceptions\nHow would I look with Mike's complexion\nEat me, freak me, take your hand and leave me\nAll I wanna say is \"I don't really give a fuck\"\ncos Most he be mega\nCopped the Play Station but still play the Sega\nand in the PJ's I DJ and blow amps\nBad as ?shrimp stampy? with the food stamps\nHuh, I'm not a stranger to danger\nOn the streets I be known as the jaw rearranger\nHeavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule\nWhite boys say it now \"Cool, cool, cool!!!\"\nI bring the fizzy that's the obvious\nI got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk\nIn the SP or the MV, see three G\nHo's see me comin in 3-D\nI spread Lizzy with ten mates\nHit the skins and I break out like an inmate\nHey yo, that's how it is and that's how I want it\nThis is my world and I'm shittin on it\n\n\n\n(On the world) Shittin on it\n(On the world) Shittin on the world\n(Here me, yeah, shittin on the world)\n\n\n\n\nI warm it up like humidity\nMel, okay I'm here til infinity\nMy shit be outta...space with the Ewok\nThis is my planet but I never wear the Reebok\nWhen we rock to the beat of accapella\nMost reigns supreme, niggas grab your umbrellas\nIt's time to bounce so where the player, mate?\nJealous MC's still drinkin on that \"Hator\"rade\nBitches flirtin with the giggles and chuckles\nYou'll never get the jezzy bare, knuckle\ncos I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it\nHold up! Back to the clinic\nUhh, aah, poked your bitch in the eye\nthen I step like Omega's hifi (AWROOF!)\nI walk the earth like Moses\nAny mackadocious, I grew up with no chips\nShows I turn out\nI got dough but still call my hos on my burnout\nBut can't phone long distance\nI'm a rich nigga still gettin public assistance\nRockin shit on a task cam\nGot MC's talkin 'bout \"I love you, man\"\nBut you can't get my last bud\nor my last dove outta beats we be makin\nDre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quakin\nThat's how it is and that's how I want it\nThis is my world and I'm shittin on it\n\n\n\n\n\nYes yes y'all, ooh funk...\nYes yes y'all, to the beat y'all\nFrom the ol schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all\nOoh in come funk\nYes yes y'all, to the beat y'all\nEvery three days and the El change ???\nOoh, Most come funk\n",
