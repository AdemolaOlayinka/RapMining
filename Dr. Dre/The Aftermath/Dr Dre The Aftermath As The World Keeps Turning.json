(nigga)\nyou can't try to be real (you can't try to be real)\nshit is for real\n\n\n\n\n\ni'm cooler than most, but i got the shorter temper\nand i'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes\nlet's take it back to the first side\nwhen you was a new jack and jockin my new track\nbut you was wrong, didn't know about the big long\nhead-strong, nicknamed dav from off the school yard\nwitta teenage group i'm turnin loots to tracks\nme and my niggas like\n(these tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight lyrics)\nyou wanna know what the hos used to do\nwhen me and my crew came bustin through\nall sorts of blushins brew\n(a neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, miscellane is the crew)\nunderground till my brown eyed balls turned blue\nthis is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front\ni smoke on, i broke on till i spoke on\nmiscellane packin shows like farrakhan\nwhere is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau\nnow that's three times your tightest flow\nand three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack\nthree times is clever (buck!)\n\n\n\n\n\nthou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt\nbarely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt\nto art in hell, where the next man dwells\nthe place with stankin pussy and crack rock dwells\n",
