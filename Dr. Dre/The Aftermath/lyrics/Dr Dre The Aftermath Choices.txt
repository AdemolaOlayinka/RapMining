The Aftermath

Ah yeah,
ah, ah
ah yeah
Time & time again 
Through our relationship 
I've wondered what's goin` wrong 
To make us go through, such pains & heartache 
But still I know 
That my love is so strong for you 

Should I love you? 
Should I leave you? 
So many choices 
Oh, oh, baby 
So many reasons why 
For me to have you near me 
So many choices 
I don't understand 
Why you wanna take me through these changes 
No no 
Ohhh 
I can't decide 
What to do when it comes to me & you 
Because my love is true 
Oh oh oh oh yeah 

Where do we go from here? 
(Where do we go?) 
I can't help but wonder 
(I can't help it baby) 
Do we belong together? 
The love I feel can't be alive 

All alone 
I don't wanna lose your love 
On my own 
Just can't be without you baby, no 
Wanna be 
Gotta have you in my life 
Can't you see 
We can make it if we try
