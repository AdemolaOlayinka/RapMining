Where you from?\nWhere you from nigga, huh?\nCompton)\n\nPst, this is about round for them\nI think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water\nYeah, down in the Pacific (the Pacific)\nWhere them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water\nListen, listen, listen\nAll you niggas swimming in the info\nGonna fuck around and drown in the specifics\nAlways going overboard, used to be my kinfolk\nNow you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes\n(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)\nThese niggas won't let up until they all wet up\nDon't get it fucked up\nNaw nigga, now everybody wanna visit\nTryna re-up that prescription (that prescription)\nYup, yeah, re-up\nThat's my nigga, water colors couldn't even paint the picture\nThey don't get the picture, fuck them\nYeah, drugs by the dozen\nYou might just wanna go and check the children\n(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)\nI'm the one that got they ear, for many years\nI been making parents live in fear\nI just wanna make it clear\nMy influence run deep like the ocean\nDon't get it fucked up\n\nBeen away from home\nBeen away from home\nAll night long\n(All they wanna know is\nWhere you from? Where you from?\nWhere you from nigga, huh?\nCompton)\n\nFeel's like you're drowning, don't you?\nAbout a hundred miles down in that ocean\nIt's over, shoulda never jumped in\nIf you can't swim (if you can't swim, if you can't swim)\nOh my God, where's a life guard when you need one?\n\nMotherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle\nMixin' up with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem\nWasn't thinking about no rapping, I was drinking for a dollar\nPutting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla\nNo releasing me, I got the beast in me\nI gotta holla, keep the decency and make them TNT my product\nI'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer\nInner-city bullet fly 'til that bitch on auto pilot (Shit)\nI don't give a fuck about your whereabouts\nAll I care about is wearing out your area\nAnd airing out your upper body\nWhen I catch ya, walking out your parents house\n(Don't get it fucked up)\nProbably got fucked up tryna park his tour bus\nNot knowing what's what\nOr who's who, living in the L.A county zoo\nPick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof\nOnce upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)\nI tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)\nThat's when I realized, banging wasn't for everybody\nSwitch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me\nThey liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him\nThey worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian\nThe beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than\nA great white, nigga this is life in my aquarium\n(Don't get it fucked up)\n\nBeen away from home\nBeen away from home\nAll night long\n(All they wanna know is\nWhere you from? Where you from?\nWhere you from nigga, huh?\nCompton)\n\nThis is about where I'm from\nI think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water\nYeah, down in the Pacific\nWhere them sharks at\nNigga, down in the deep water\n\nHelp me\nFeels like you're drowning\nI'm drowning\nHelp me\nHelp me, help me\nSomebody help me\n(Shoulda never jumped in\nIf you, if you can't swim)\nHelp me\nHelp me, help me, help me\nI can't, I can't breathe\nI can't wait, help\n(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)\nGod please, please help me, please\nPlease help me, please help...\nPlease help, please...please...\n",
