Come on, yo, no equal\nSo if ya wanna do it to yourself\nThat is to mess around with the jazz, then just blame yourself\nCuz you made your bed, so now you lay in it\nThat's your (shit) on the floor, then go and play in it\nI refuse to catch a 'L' in a battle\nCuz yo, I got the jazz and I'll whup a rapper's (ass)\nInto little next to nuthin\nTest me if I'm frontin\nI'm passin flyin colors cuz yo...\n\n\nWho got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)\nWe've got the jazz\nCome on\nCome on, Phife\n\n\nNo need for introductions cuz you know who I be (the Phife Dawg)\nYep, the one who loves to slaugher MCs\nI got style, grace and razamatazz\nI'm like my girl Patrice Rushen, yo\nI add pizazz, now\nMost people remember Phife from the Phife like smoothness\nBut now it's time to hit you with roughneck rudeness\nI'm still vexed, fuming, gots to come raw\nThe first punk that tries to flex, I'll be cracking your jaw\nI'll mold you, fold you, roll you up like a spliff\nDon't ever try to test or else that (ass) will get whipped\nI'm forever poppin junk, its like a fat invite\nTo any MC who wants to flex, yo, we can do this tonight\nGel up my posse up on Linden and 1-9-2\nPull up my brothas from Sayers Ave., the Brooklyn Zoo\nAll my crew up in Strong Island, so yo, don't sleep\nCuz it only takes a peek to watch that (ass) get beat\nBrothas wanna play rough, but they can all get some\nWanna be hero, but you're a zero, that means you gets none\nDon't ever try to step to a kid you can't get with\nWhy mess with a brotha that your girl once slept with?\nI'm a negro, he's a negro, wanna be a negro too?\nBut beatin on a woman, is somethin that a puss would do\nI love jazz, but that doesn't mean that I'm timid\nNot really a gangsta rapper but I can swing it for a minute\n\n\nWho got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)\nCome on\nWho got the jazz? (We've got the jazz)\nCome on\nI go...woo...grand groove, grand groove\nOoh...grand groove, grand groove\nCheck it out\nWe got the jazz y'all\n",
