Bring it to the table at the meetings\nGathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings\nAs I carry on with my proceedings\nGreetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings\nBut before I be face to face with my eternal resting place\nI hope you find civilized every soul and every race\nSit dog sit!\nBusta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!\n",
