Her love was a KO\nWe was on the under, had to stay on the lay low\nUse to go so deep, she had to say Aiyyo\nRock with her friend, but her friend drove both way\nAsked her about it and she used to say No way\nJust let it go yo, I used to say OK\nJust another day but fight anyway\n\n\n\nI put it down man, whatcha gonna do\n\nWell hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do\n\nWe put it down for the area crew\nAll the shortys that smoking y'all whoo\nLooking good it you sipping on your brew\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\n\n\n\nMet a shorty named Kenny\nFrom East Saint Louie\nBody good and plenty\nThe finest in Missouri\nIf you had no money, you better hit the highway\nEven in her own right, she had to do it her way\n\n\n\nIt was an ill situation when I met Dantanya\nWorked in Saint Louis, in her mother's hair parlor\nUse to hit her man for cake to come see me\nHer and her man from home, they sold heemey\nWe had it hemmed, locked, sold and shit\nWhen I thugged it yo, she said I was the ultimate\nBroke her up kid, driving the drill like Truck Turner\nAll of things they did not concern her\nPeople that we love yo, we love for a passion\nI'ma type of cat that brings forth the action\nYou feeling me yo?\nI hope you hearing me yo\nOne more thing before you start cheering me yo\n\n\n\nI put it down Phife, what we gonna do\n\nWell hell, I put it down son, whatcha gonna do\n\nWe put it down for the area crew\nAll the shortys that smoking y'all whoo\nLooking good it you sipping on your brew\nCome here ma, we make it hot for you\n",
