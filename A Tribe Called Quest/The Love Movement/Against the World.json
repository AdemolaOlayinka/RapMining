Forget how he feel/\n\n\n\n\n\nMe and you girl go against the world,\nAgainst the world?,\nHell yeah the world\n\n\nYeah the world,\nYeah the world,\nYeah the world,\nWhole wide world,\nYeah the world,\nYeah the world,\nYeah the world,\nWhole wide world,\nYeah the world,\nYeah the world/\n\n\n\nZonin' undress ya???Still hold play???\nOr can you hold my hand, it's better that way,\nIf we was on video I'd press rewind,\nA nigga think about you all the time,\nPidgeon dropped a note on top my head,\nR&B,pop girl's a thoroughbred,\nRun around the track, let me slow you dowwwwnnnnnn...\nPick you up,\nRaise your cups,\nLet's double up,\nBomb came known, natural disas,\nFall in love with me? huh, well that's that ass,\nWanna get you, inside my world,\nProcess, straight, afro or curl,\nStretch me out, fade me in,\nForever you in need let me see you grin?\nHe bust with you, I'm a tap his chin??\nMake me feel special, I know that you can,\nMake me feel special like a prominent man,\nProminent, dominant McCoy and I'm real,\nAnother brotha's fan? forget he feel/\n",
