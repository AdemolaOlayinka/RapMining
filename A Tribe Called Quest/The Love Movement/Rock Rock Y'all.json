And\nwe want ya'll all to know, that it's time...\n\n\nTo rock rock ya'll\nFreak freak ya'll\nTo the beat ya'll\nIt's unique ya'll\n\n\nA-yo praise the master, make plans wit' your pastor\nMy rap'll blast ya, send you to the hereafter\nI push a tractor, for horses grazin' in the pasture\nYa heard I was trickin', the whole room filled with laughter\nIn ciphers, I'm the one you don't rhyme after\nYou only know half of the math, it don't add up\nThe lead batter, my hits make ya frame shatter\nWatch me now! Just begun like Jimmy Castor\nI'm bad luck just like walkin' under ladders\nMad rappers, book of life, last chapter\nMe and my squad build just like contractors\nI break shit, you only give hairline fractures\nWomen flash us, don't know ya better ask us\nA bastard, wit' more contacts than Lens Crafters\nTear down the rafters, venerials couldn't clap us\nYou need practice, hit chicks then I'm Casper\n\n\nThe church of scientology, feminine biology\nManic depressive psychologically, A.D.D. alive and we\nPolluted by technology, the fumes and its ecology\nWhile your thought you was out of copy I get nastier than sodomy\nProbably an oddesey, started back on robbery\nWas the degree of the economy that do the sovereignty\nRegarded as a prodigy, leery in sociology\nLet the wallabees always conceal my gynecology\nRhymin' pathologically, that's how it gotta be!\nNever makin' no apology, worshippin' my anthropology\nFuck modesty, studyin' microbiology\nCausin' verbal lobotomy, it's in my geneology\nSix months of sobriety, movin' very methodically\nLike a unicorn, more ways than oceanography\nGuard technology, rip shows antibiotically\nTrue thugs bionically, give birth to criminology\n\n\nYo as a youngin', I swear to God you couldn't tell me nothin'\nI swore I was gettin' somethin', clothes or humpin'\nFor girls with the church, slacks with some shirts tucked in\nI set it up for money, my mom worked when I was cuttin'\nUnsigned strugglin', for the heat I lit the oven\nOne would by the CD, the other would do the dubbin'\nBefore I met Rob, I was in the clubs frontin'\nOh yeah I know the Tip, when I see him I be duckin'\nBut now when I'm clubbin', those that used to dis were buggin'\nOverweight chicks, spandex, they stomachs sucked in\nStay interruptin', dance and try to cut in\nTold people you got in free when you really snuck in\n\n\nWe never get concerned about who's in the league\nWe just stay workin' so no one will need\nAn unconcerned outsider givin' niggaz feed\nMy niggaz puff weed but negotiate the seed\nThe family is granite and you can't intercede\nI try to switch lanes at this operatin' speed\nCats in the game be gamblin' with greed\nWe the house, you the player and we gonna catch these\nWho's the Sam Sneed makin' microphones bleed\nPoker face creed while my mind just read\nShorty got rhythm but her freak got freed\nThat's insignificant but this take heed\n\n\nThey say I'm pretty like Clay is, bright like the day is\nBeats from my fleet be sweet like Sugar Ray is\nI'm swingin' this from Bay Ridge to where the Oakland Bay is\nMy game is tough to play, I'm tough to weigh like your safe is\nThe aim is, to make you recognize what the name is\nMos Def gon' set it straight from where the 718 is\nThe place with the great superiginate the flavors\nAn all-star block with some all-star laymans\n(Turn the music down!) This is probably some haters\nAchin' cuz they hear us rotatin' on the playlist\n>From B-boy laces to Detroit gators\nYo Tip I got to bail, where the scale? Help me weigh this...\n\nYo! We wan't ya'll to know...that this is the family, right?\nAnd what we want everybody out there to do...on the dance floor...\nis get ready...because noooowwwwww we gonna...\n",
