Ha hah\nWe bout to count it down, we bout to count it off\nIt goes a-one, two, three, ahh!\n\n\nMalik we gettin back into that shit again\nAnd when we rhyme, brothers need to break they pens, uh-oh\nIt's The Love Movement never ends\nThe rap game'll never be the same again\n(Phife Dawg where you at baby?) We came again\n\n\nHere I come again, you feelin fine?\nThe Dawg is like a overflowin rhyme from mind\nUsually mess with shorties whose a 8 or 9\nShorty bump around to the bass-line\n\n\nF keeps a burner on the waist-line\nThat cat's trickin off, I ain't wastin mine\nYou feel the uniqueness, you seekin this?\nAnd when we do it, we be freakin this\n\n\nDon't even front, you know you feelin this\nMy shade is borderin around licorice (licorice)\nEnjoyin this tune, glad you playin it\n(Aiyyo Phife what's the hook?)\nHere we sayin it, SAYIN IT, SAYIN IT\n\n\n\nMy pad and my pen (ah ah, you didn't go there)\nThe beat and the blend (say word, you didn't go there)\nThe party won't end (you know, we got to be there)\nJust keep your ?, buildin with friends, yo\n\n\n\nOne love, one life, and one destiny\nIt seems that the devil keeps testin me\nGot the illest part of the recipe\nYo tell your homegirl to stop stressin me (stop it)\nUndressin me is the part you really like\nBrothers hold the cracks now they holdin mics\nThe cusses you get, ? steady rights\nMarauders, we did that shit at Mid-night, a-ah-aight-aight\n\n\nI love it when my honeydip be slobbin me\nDon't take it personal it's just comedy\nMy comedy completely turned to tragedy\nI sense some of these rappers still be mad at me\nSweatin her because of her anatomy\nWhen I bang you it'll be assault and battery\nDon't make me discombobulate your micraphone\nTalkin trash will only get you freakin head, flown\n\n\nUhh, buy em out the box, never faulty ones\nGet in that ass like karate son\nI act with the light, sometimes it's lookin grim\nWe manage a smile, sometimes we slip it in\n\n\nMy Tribe be worldwide like the Nike swoosh\nEmcees be soundin moist like vagina juice\nThe top of the world, we pursuin it\nDon't worry about a thing, cause we doin it\nDOIN IT, DOIN IT\n\n\n\n\nThat's the way we do.. c'mon, that's the way we do\nIt's the nigga D-Life, with T-C-Q\nThat's the way we are.. and the beat won't stop\nGot to blow it up for the top..\nDidn't think you knew how we rock..\n",
