    "lyrics": "1991)\nLet me tell you 'bout the snakes, the fakes, the lies\nThe highs at all of these industry shing-dings\nWhere you see the pretty girls\nIn the high animated world\nCheckin' for a rapper with all the dough\nIf you take a shit they want to know\nAnd if you're gonna fall, they won't be around, y'all\nSo you still wanna do the show business?\nAnd you think that you got what it takes?\nI mean you really gotta rap and be all that\nAnd prepare yourself for the breaks\nCheck it out!\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The Business)\nThe ups and downs with the hoes (The Business)\nAlways gettin' fronted on at shows (The Business)\nPeople gotta stick their nose (In the Business)\n\n\n\n\n\nYo, I gotta speak on the cesspool\nIt's the rap industry and it ain't that cool\nOnly if you're on stage or if you're speakin' to your people\nAin't no-one your equal\nEspecially on the industry side\nDon't let the games just glide\nRight through your fingers, you gotta know the deal\nSo Lord Jamar speak, because you're real...\n\n\n\nThey're givin' you the business and puttin' on a show\nYou're a million dollar man that ain't got no dough\nBut you got a ho tickets backstage to a show\nSedated and at that fact they elated\nTime pass and your ass say \"Where's my loot?\"\nThe reply is a kick in the ass from a leg and a boot\nAll you wanna do is taste the fruit\nBut in the back they're makin' fruit juice\nYou ask for slack and wanna get cut loose from the label\nNot able cos you signed at the table\nFor a pretty cash advance, now they got a song and dance\nThat you didn't recoup, more soup wit' ya meal?\nCos this is the real when you get a record deal\nAnd I say...\n\n\n\nAw....shucks, look what the cat hauled in\nIt's Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest, let me begin\nLike Chuck D, I got so much trouble on my mind\n'bout these no-talent artists gettin' signed, they can't rhyme\nAnd if that ain't bad, you got bootleggers\nGoin' out like suckers, motherfuckers\nFeel it's time that I let loose the lion\nAnd if not that then I'll commence to head flyin'\nSeems in '91 everybody want a rhyme\nAnd then you go and sell my tape for only $5.99?\nPlease nigga, I've worked too hard for this\nNo more will I take the booty end of the stick\nBogus brothers makin' albums when they know they can't hack it\nCos they lyrics is played like 8-Ball jackets\nNow tell me I can't tear it up\nGo get yourself some toilet paper cos your lyrics is butt\n\nDo you wanna be in the business? (The Business)\nPeople can't walk a straight line in (The Business)\nSome of these brothers can't rhyme in (The Business)\nA-yo, I'm tryna get mine (The Business)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party scene is cool, but then again it's all the same\nYou see the same faces, but at different places\nWhen you're up and ridin' high everything is palsy-palsy\nGet a million pounds and all the skins give you hugs\nWell that's cool, I can dig it, it really ain't my bag\nPrefer to max on the side and let my pants sag\n\"Oh, he's a cutie\", yeah, real cute\nBut I wasn't that cute when I didn't have no loot\nAlthough I hit a pound of herbs I'm still nice with the verbs\nSo fuck what you heard\nThe born cipher, cipher master makes me think much faster\nBut critics still continue to plaster\nMy name and discredit my fame\nAll that shit is game\nAnd I don't really give a damn\nEat from the tree of life and throw away the verbal ham\n\n\n\nWell, excuse me, I gotta add my two cents in\nDon't be alarmed, the rhyme was condensed in\nA matter of minutes so it must be told\nAll that glitters' not gold\nEverybody wants a deal, help me make a demo\nSee my name in bright lights, ride around in a limo\nMy moms keeps beefin' (\"Boy, get a job\")\nBut I wanna make jams, damn, I know I'll slam\nHuh, well it's not that easy\nYou gotta get a label that's willin' and able\nTo market and promote, and you better hope\n(For what?) That the product is dope\nTake it from Diamond, it's like mountain climbin'\nWhen it comes to rhymin' you gotta put your time in\nGet a good lawyer so problems won't pile\nYou don't wanna make a pitch that's wild.\n",
