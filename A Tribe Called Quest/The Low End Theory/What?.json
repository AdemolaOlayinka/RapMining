All balls, no cock\nWhat is a war if it doesn't have a general?\nWhat's channel nine if it doesn't have Arsenio?\nWhat is life if you don't have fun?\nWhat is a what if you ain't got a gun?\nWhat's Ali without Shaheed Muhammad?\nNothing. Kapelka makes you vomit\nWhat is a Quest if the players ain't willing?\nWhat is a pence if you don't have a shilling?\nExcuse me if I'm chillin, hey what, say what\nWhat's a fat man without food in his gut?\nWhat's a child birth, without the umbilical?\nWhat's United Parcel, without the deliverer?\nWhat's momma-san, without poppa-san?\nWhat's martial arts without Daniel-San?\nWhat's Rasheed without Tonya, Tamika?\nWhat's orange juice and Doug E. Doug without Shaniqua?\nNot a not a not a not a damn thing\nWhat's Duke Ellington without that swing?\nWhat's Alex Haley if it doesn't have roots?\nWhat's a weekend if you ain't knockin boots?\nWhat's a black nation, without black unity?\nWhat is a child who doesn't know pubery?\nWhat is my label when I exit boom status?\nWhat's menage-a-tois, or, that is\nWhat is sex when you have three people?\nWhat are laws if they ain't fair and equal?\nWhat's Clark Kent without a telephone booth?\nWhat is a liquor if it ain't 80 proof?\nWhat are the youth if they ain't rebellin?\nWhat's Raplh Cramden, if he ain't yellin\nAt Ed Norton, what is coke snortin?\nWhat is position if there is no contortin?\nWhat is hip-hop if it doesn't have violence?\nChill for a minute, Doug E. Fresh said silence\n\nWhat is a glock if you don't have a clip?\nWhat's a lollipop without the Good Ship?\nWhat's S&M if you don't have chains?\nWhat's a con artist if he doesn't have brains?\nWhat's America without greed and glamour?\nWhat's an MC if he doesn't have stamina?\nWhat's music fractured without Mr. Walt?\nWhat's Trugoy without a phrase called torte?\nWhat's Kris Lighty if he wasn't such a baby?\nWhat is a woman if she didn't say maybe?\nBaby laid down, I removed the frown\nWhat would be my penal cord if it wasn't brown?\nWhat is a paper without a president?\nWhat is a compound without a element?\nWhat is a jam if you don't spike the punch?\nWhat's a Brewski if you don't buy brunch?\nOooh ooh, it's like that you keep goin\nFreak freak y'all cause you know that we showin\nWhat to go what to go what to go what to go what\nTo go what to go what to go what to go WHAT\n",
