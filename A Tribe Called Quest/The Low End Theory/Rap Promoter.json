Don't step to me with that\nIf you promotin the show make sure it ain't wack\n\nOr else I'm leaving (\"let me tell you\")\nI'm leaving ( \"let me tell you\")\nI'm leaving ( \"let me tell you\")\nYour wack show\n\nYo man whassup with that?\nYo don't sweat me...\n... c'mon, five hundred, that was the deal\nC'mon man, don't try to play me out\nWe don't need you, sorry!!!\nYou know you need me\n\n\n\nAnd the Abstract rapper says\n\nI want chicken, and orange juice, ?dat sauce on my rider?\nAnd my occasional potato by Oreida\nDon't forget my pastry make sure they're tasty\nI'm not the type to be pushy or hasty\nSee I'm the type of bro that's reared in the ghetto\nTook a few shorts before\nNow the only ones I take are the ones that I wear\nAin't takin no shorts no more, now\nplease act proper 'fore I call the CrimeStoppers\nDon't dip on the dough, cause that's a no-no\nMake sure you count your money real slow\nBe alert, look alive, and act like ya know\nIt's, the 90's, time to make moves\nNot, the 80's, do away withcha womb\nSo what? You got a crew\nI got one too, they're called the Brooklyn Zoo\nDon't break fool, let's be reserved and cool\nWe don't have to act like we in grade school\nJust make sure that we're taken care of\nAnd we'll do a fly show for ya bub, check it out\nDiggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy\nDiggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy\nDiggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-a-diddy\nDiggi-dang-diggi-dang, di-dang-ga-dang-diggy-diggy\n",
