    "lyrics": "We got the jazz\n\n\n\nStern firm and young with a laid-back tongue\nThe aim is to succeed and achieve at 21\nJust like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound\nCaptivate the mass, cause the prose is profound\n\nDo it for the strong, we do it for the meek\nBoom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep\nOr your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz\nThe rave of the town to your foes and your friends\n\nSo push it, along, trails, we blaze\nDon't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise\nThe tranquility will make ya unball your fist\nFor we put hip-hop on a brand new twist\n\nA brand new twist with the homie-alistic\nSo low-key that ya probably missed it\nAnd yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd\nWhen the guy takes the beat, they bowed\n\nSo raise up squire, address your attire\nWe have no time to wallow in the mire\nIf you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead\nJoin in the essence of the cool-out breed\n\nThen cool out to the music cuz it makes ya feel serene\nLike the birds and the bees and all those groovy things\nLike getting stomach aches when ya gotta go to work\nOr staring into space when you're feeling berserk\n\nI don't really mind if it's over your head\nCuz the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead\nSo pay attention, it's not hard to decipher\nAnd after the horns, you can check out the Phifer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetition, dem Phifer come sideway\nBut competition, dey mus' me come straightway\nCompetition, dem Phifer come sideway\nBut competition, dey mus' come straightway\n\nHows about that, it seems like it's my turn again\nAll through the years my mike has been my best friend\nI know some brothers wonder, can Phifer really kick it?\nSome even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?\n\nI'm all into my music cuz it's how I make papes\nTryin' to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes\nMe sweat another? I do my own thing\nStrictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing\n\nI grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks\nCollect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks\nI sing, and chat, I do all of that\nIt's 1991 and I refuse to come wack\n\nI take off my hat to other crews that intend to rock\nBut the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop\nI got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear\nStop look and listen, but please don't stare\n\nSo jet to the store, and buy the LP\nOn Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's\nProduced and arranged by the four-man crew\nAnd oh shit, Skiff Anselm, he gets props too\n\nMake sure you have a system with some phat house speakers\nSo the new shit can rock, from Mars to Massapequa\nCuz where I come from quality is job one\nAnd everybody up on Linden know we get the job done\n\nSo peace to that crew, and peace to this crew\nBring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you\n\n\n\n\nHey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up\nPlease let the Abstract embellish on the cut\n\nBack and forth just like a Cameo song\nIf you dig this joint then please come dance along\nTo the music cuz it's done just for the rhyme\nNow I gotta scat and get mine, underline\n\nThe jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass\nCuz the Tribe originates that feelin' of pizzazz\nIt's the universal sound, best to brothers underground\nIn the one-six below, ya didn't have to go\n\nSome say that I'm a sinner cuz I once had an orgy\nAnd sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies\nIf this is a stinker, then call me a stink, I ask\n\"What? What? What?\" - now check it out\n\nAll my peoples in Queens ya don't stop\nNow all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop\nAnd all my peoples uptown ya don't stop\nThat includes the Bronx a' Harlem ya don't stop\n\nNow to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop\nI say because Ladies First ya don't stop\nAnd to the JB's, ya don't stop\nAnd De La Soul, ya don't stop\n\nTo my Brand Nubians ya don't stop\nAnd to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop\nTo my man Large Professor ya don't stop\nPete Rock for the beat ya don't stop\n\nEverybody in the place ya don't stop\nYa keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop\nAnd last but not least on the sure shot\nIt's the Zulu nation\n",
