To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does\nBefore this, did you really know what live was?\nComprehend to the track, for it's why cuz\nGettin measures on the tip of the vibers\nRock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz\nWipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug\nIf you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug\nCome and spread your arms if you really need a hug\nAfrocentric living is a big shrug\nA life filled with *HORN* that's what I love\nA lower plateau is what we're above\nIf you diss us, we won't even think of\nWill Nipper the doggy give a big shove?\nThis rhythm really fits like a snug glove\nLike a box of positives is a plus, love\nAs the Tribe flies high like a dove\n\n\nCan I kick it? (Yes, you can!)\nWell, I'm gone (Go on then!)\n\nCan I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers\nRight now, Phife is a poem sayer\nAt times, I'm a studio conveyor\nMr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?\nYou'll be doing us a really big favor\nBoy this track really has a lot of flavor\nWhen it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior\nFollow us for the funky behavior\nMake a note on the rhythm we gave ya\nFeel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir\nDo you like the garments that we wear?\nI instruct you to be the obeyer\nA rhythm recipe that you'll savor\nDoesn't matter if you're minor or major\nYes, the Tribe of the game, rhythm player\nAs you inhale like a breath of fresh air\n",
