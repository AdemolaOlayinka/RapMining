Baby, understand.\"\nShe ignored and walked through the gate\nThe king is in the kingdom to await his fate...of the enemy\nThe Pubic Enemy\n\n\nPropmaster(yeah) Please listen to me(what?)\nSomething lurkin by the JimBrowski\n(Who? Jenny?)\nNo, not propulated\nA horrible creature that must be penetrated\nHe gets all into ya, then he tries to do ya\nYou better run fast, he's gonna pursue the...\n(What? Yo listen here. Propmaster whiz, no one fears...)\nOh, the caves know, just thought I'd let ya know\nHow he lives and how he go\nWatch yourself when you're out on the run\nThe enemy is missed, we'll have too much fun\nThere's four friends of mine that thought they were bad\nAnd laid up this girl, so now, they're sad\nThey scratched and scratched like it was Saturday and...\n\n\nListen here. This is Cool DJ Red Alert\nKnown as the true, the only, the very one, the Propmaster\nThere's only one thing I gotta tell ya\nThere's a whole lotta propmasters out there. You know what I mean\nShaheed a propmaster, Q-Tip a propmaster\nThe Jungle Brothers a propmaster, BDP a propmaster\n45 King a propmaster\nI won't tell you nuthin bout the ladies, they ain't no propmaster\nBut you know who's the main propmaster\nMEEEEEEEE!!!!!!\n",
