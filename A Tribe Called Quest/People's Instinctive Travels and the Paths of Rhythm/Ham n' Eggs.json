No, Tip do you eat em?\nUh huh, not at all(again)\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nJarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em? (Nope)\nNot at all\n\n\nA tisket, a tasket, what's in mama's basket?\nSome veggie links and some fish that stinks\nWhy, just the other day, I went to Grandma's house\nSmelled like she conjured up a mouse\nEggs was fryin, ham was smellin\nIn ten minutes, she started yellin (come and get it)\nAnd the gettin's were good\nI said, I shouldn't eat, she said, I think you should\nBut I can't, I'm plagued by vegetarians\nNo cats and dogs, I'm not a veterinarian\nStrictly collard greens and a occasional steak\nGoes on my plate\nAsparagus tips look yummy, yummy, yummy\nCandied yams inside my tummy\nA collage of good eats, some snacks or nice treats\nApple sauce and some nice red beets\nThis is what we snack on when we're Questin'\nNo second guessin\n\n\n\n\n\nNow drop the beat, so I can talk about my favorite tastings\nThe food that is the everlasting, see I'm not fasting\nI'm gobbling, like a dog on turkey\nBeef jerky, slim jims, I eat sometimes\nI like lemons and limes\nAnd if not that, take it the road see and the salad sopped\nSit back, relax, listen to some hip hop\n\n\nGum drops and gummy bears tease my eyes\nA sight for sore ones and some bore pies\nAnd other goodies that are filled with goop\nWith fried apple roots\nDelectable delights, control my appetites\nMine is for me, right, but I know what I like\nChicken for lunch, chicken for my dinner\nChicken, chicken, chicken, I'm a finger lickin winner\nWhen breakfast time comes, I don't recognize\nPig in the pan or a pair of bogey chides\nMixed with stewed tomatoes, home fried potatoes\nOr anything with flair, cook it, I'm in there\nPay attention to the Tribe as we impose\nThis is how it goes\n\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nA yo, Phife do you eat em? Nah, Tip do you eat em?\nUh huh, not at all(come again, y'all)\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nJarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em?\nNope, not at all\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nAfrika do you eat em? No, Pos, do you eat em?\nHell yeah, all the time\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nPhife, do you eat em? Nah, Tip, do you eat em?\nUh huh, not at all\nJarobi, do you eat em? Nope, Shah, do you eat em?\nNope, not at all\nI don't eat no ham n' eggs, cuz they're high in cholesterol\nAfrika, do you eat em? No, Gary, do you eat em?\nYeah, all the time\n",
