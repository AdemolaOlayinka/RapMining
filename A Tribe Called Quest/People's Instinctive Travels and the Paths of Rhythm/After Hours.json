    "lyrics": "After Hours it was cool\n\nTen after one I think I'll hop the horse\nDowntown late of three of course\nJust came from fishing couldn't get a catch\nDowntown they'll probably have a batch\nA whitened sandwich and a Guiness stout\nBut with the bail though I had a bout\nSo I exchanged it for some apple juice\nI had the blues but I shook them loose\nA jeep is blasting from the urban streets\nLoots of funk over hardcore beats\nThe moon dabbles in the morning sky\nAs the minutes just creep on by\nI get a thought and hear comes my Tribe\nRitual shakes and in good vibes\nLike always the Quest begins\nIn the mist though but the rhyth's move in\nWe find a spot and we sit and chat\nSpeaking on the status quo of rap\nA derelick makes a real long speach\nWe pay attention to the words he read\nWhen he was done we rattled on\nThere was no lunch because it wasn't dawn\nWe pointed things out about this times\nThe worlds famons and the crazy crimes\nInflation of the nation, it bothers me\nI better go gold, to pay the taxes\nGotta be swift society\nThe man whose made is the man who maxes\nThe grounds for living are being discussed\nAs we go it gets close to dusk\nGather thoughts and savor breath\nCause there's only a few hours left\n\nAfter Hours it was cool\n\nMe ohh my, hey-hey, hey-hey\nThe human hours are here to stay\nThis is how it seems my witness\nBug out all night, ask Phife, he's with this\nGirls be screaming on this conversation\nI have my two cents for a revelation\nAnd my watch continuously tic-tocs\nShaheed will bring up the beats that rocks\nI hear the frogs and the smashing of bottles\nA car revs up and I hear it trottle\nIt probably moves with the morning wind\nOhh my God, here's Phife again\ntalking about last nights game\nTrying to remember someone's name\nSo hear the frogs dancing in the streets\nOnce again Ali will bring up the beat\nLike this\n\n\nThe beat is over and so is the night\nThe sun is risen and the shine is bright\nWe all say peace and go our separate ways\nYouth is fading as we gain our days\nExpedition for the song is simp'\nThe hours creep, excuse me, I mean limp\nAs we go you hear a gasp of laugh\nAs we start up our rhythmic path\nLike this\n",
