    "lyrics": "As we start trudgin, me and my brothers we be lookin and be buggin\nVehicles of life they be rollin and be mergin\nSearchin for the virgins of life\nthat be shovin out the door that's crack\nThe valleys of time, are always on my feet\nAs least the beat will combine\nThe calluses and corns with the funky bassline\nYou don't need underdog for a nickel shoeshine or the shoes that's phat\nWell can I get a level on the bass and on the treble\nFootin up and down like a UNLV Rebel\nThe answer be amongst us cos we rarely dig acoustics\nCan't be too much flackin, not too much packin\nYou must container that at least to dip your hand in rap\nYour feet will be infectious so at least realise the fact\nThe rhythms are inserted and the nurse can be converted\nThis ain't rock 'n' roll cos the rap is in control\nIf you're a megastar, worth will buy you a car\nI'd rather go barefootin, for prints I will be puttin\nall over the earth if we can get there first\nNow that we are in it, footprints are bein printed\nSo fi you recognise em, you can try to size em\nThey'll probably be the ones with the size not fryin\nall over reveal, you won't have to yield\nIf you want protection you can hide behind the shield\n\n\nYou can game on the gallons if you really need to rock\nBut we walk while we talk as we stompin through the block\nHand in hand 'cross the land as Muhammad cross the fade\nIt's a Tribe who meanders, precious like a jade\nIt's a art, Theo arch rhymes the ground placed upon\nThe mind will unwind, it will soft to beyond\nCatch the track, track by track, get a map to track a trail\nYou will find yourself behind for a map does not prevail\nSee the levels peakin as the rhythms keep-a screechin\nA Quest, oh yes a Quest, inside the jam I will keep preachin\nthe point, oh yes the point, because it's close but yet so far\nThe loudiness is ringin as we scoot across the star\nWe are bulgin, I'm indulgin in a rat-a-tat-tat\nExplanation for the liners that the rhythm is phat\nKeep it wild, wide and deep, you could dig it in a jeep\nBut dig it in the ground because the foot print now\n\n\nIf there's a storm that's brewin, it won't keep us from doin\nour thing as we start swingin, travellin is bringin\njoy inside the domes as we hit the road to roam/Rome\nA chair is not a chair, a house is not a home\nBecause my skin is brown, yo I'm gonna do the town\nRub it in the face and rub my feet all through the place\nWhen you get your finger on the music it'll linger\nSing a song o' sixpence, sing it like a singer\nA Nubian, a Nubian, a proud one at that\nRemember me, the brother who said \"Black is black\"\nYou can come by request, I don't play, I don't dress\nGet emotions off your chest, we are black, we the best\nMakin moves, makin motions, flowin like an ocean\nThe walkin will continue, we know that we will bring you\nthe times that you have waited, more anticipated\nBe gone but not for long because the feet will stay strong\n",
