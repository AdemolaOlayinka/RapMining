place with the mic in their hand\nOaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John\n\n\nPeople give your ears so I be sublime\nIt's enjoyable to know you and the concubine\nNiggaz, take off your coats ladies, act liike chorus Dove from De La Soul:\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nNew York, NJ, N.C., VA\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nOaktown, L.A., San Fran, St. John\n\n\nPeople give your ears so I be sublime\nIt's enjoyable to know you and the concubine\nNiggaz, take off your coats ladies, act like GEMS\nSit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns\nSee, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the mo-mo\nludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo\nHeard me in the eighties, J Beez on the promo\nOn my never endin quest to get the paper on the\ncaper\nBut now, let me take it to the Queens side\nI'm takin it to Brooklyn side\nAll the residential Questers to invade the way\nHold up a second son, cuz we almost there\nYou can be a black man and lose all your soul\nYou can be white and blue but don't crap the roll\nSee my shit is universal, if you got knowledge and\ndolo\nOf delf for self, see there's no one else\nWho can drop it on the angle, acute at that\nSo, do that, do that, do do that that that(come on)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that(OK)\nDo that, do that, do do that that that\nI'm buggin out, so let me get back cuz I'm wettin\nniggaz\nSo run and tell the others cuz we are the brothas\nI learned how to build mics in my workshop class\nSo give me this award, and let's not make it the\nlast\n\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nHouston, Delaware, DC, Dallas\n\n\nBack in '89, I simply slid into place\nBuddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face\nA lot of kids was bustin rhymes but they had no\ntaste\nSome said Quest was wack, but now is that the case\nI have a quest to have the mic in my hand\nWithout that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman\nSo Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts\nPhife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt\nWhen was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy\nLyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy\nTop notch baby, never comin less\nSky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest\nSit back , relax, get up out the path\nIf not that, here's the dancefloor, come move that\nass\nNon-believers, you can check the stats\nI roll with Shaheed and the brotha Abstract\nNiggaz know the time when the Quest is in the jam\nI never let a statue tell me how nice I am\nComin with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees\nLivin mad phat like an over sized Bam-bi\nThe wackest crews try to dis, it makes me laugh\nWhen my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft\nSo, next time that you think you want somethin here\nMake somethin deffer, take that garbage to St.\nElsewhere\n\n\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nS.C., Maryland, New Orleans, Motown\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place with the mic in their hand\nChinatown, Spokane, London, Tokyo\nWe on Award Tour with Muhammad my man\nGoin each and every place
