    "lyrics": "My mother went away for a month-long trip\nHer and some friends on an ocean-liner ship\nShe made a big mistake by leaving me home\nI had to roam so I picked up the phone\nDialed Ali up to see what was going down\nTold him I pick him up so we could drive around\nTook the Dodge Dart, a '74\nMy mother left a yard but I needed one more\nShaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks\nSo we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks\ndrove down the Belt, got on the Conduit\nCame to a toll, we paid and went through it\nHad no destination, we was on a quest\nAli laid in the back so he could get rest\nDrove down the road for two-days-and-a-half\nThe sun had just risen on a dusty path\nJust then a figure had caught my eye\nA man with a sombrero who was four feet high\nI pulled over to ask were we was at\nHis index finger he tipped up his hat\n\"El Segundo,\" he said, \"my name is Pedro\nIf you need directions, I'll tell you pronto\"\nNeeded civilization, some sort of reservation\nHe said a mile south, there's a fast food station\nThanks, senor, as I start up the motor\nAli said, \"Damn, Tip, why you drive so far for?\"\n\n(Well describe to me what the wallet looks like)\n\nAnyway a gas station we passed\nWe got gas and went on to get grub\nIt was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere\nAnywhere would have been better\nI ordered enchiladas and I ate 'em\nAli had the fruit punch\nWhen we finished we thought for ways to get back\nI had a hunch\nAli said, \"Pay for lunch\"\nSo I did it\nPulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady\nShe was a waitress there\nPut the wallet down and stared and stared\nTo put me back into reality, here's Shaheed:\n\"Yo, Tip, man, you got what you need?\"\nI checked for keys and started to step\nWhat do you know, my wallet I forget\n\nYo, it was a brown wallet, it had props numbers\nHad my jimmy hats I got to get it man\n\nLord, have mercy\nThe heat got hotter, Ali stars to curse me\nI fell bad but he makes me feel badder\nChit-chit-chatter, car stars to scatter\nBreaking on out, we was Northeast bound\nJettin' on down at the seepd of sound\nThree days coming and three more going\nWe get back and there was no slack\n490 Madison, we're here, Sha\nHe said, \"All right, Tip, see you tomorrow\"\nThinking about the past week, the last week\nHands go in my pocket, I can't speak\nHopped in the car and torpe'ed to the shack\nOf Shaheed, \"We gotta go back\" when he said\n\"Why?\" I said, \"We gotta go\n'Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo\"\n\nYeah, I left my wallet in El Segundo\nLeft my wallet in El Segundo\nLeft my wallet in El Segundo\nI gotta get, I got-got ta get it\n",
