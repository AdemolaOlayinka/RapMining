(Yeah!!)\nHere we go..\n\nPeople in the audience, they cry out \"hoe\"\nPeople with a gun, yo they'll cry out \"bo!\"\nI don't like a cop, I don't sell a rock\nbut still the kanga's clock me, after a show\nStandin on the stage and we're pourin with sweat\nTo people in the crowd I give what they get\nPapers make paid, babies make laid\nI don't really worry, nor do I fret\nWaitin for the gimme and boy I got some\nSweat like a peach and tart like a plum\nI thought what I think, I rock a bead-link\nLegally I'll sip when I turn, twenty-one\nA letter to the homeboy that freaked the head dome\nThe R man wants me to drop my microphone\nGotta be brief; no orders from a chief\nHot butter on what, say what, the popcorn\nOn the tour bus we hit the truck stop\nA dollar for some chips, a quarter for some pop\nWe laugh and giggle some, Phife kiss the honeybuns\nAli Shaheed Muhammad keeps talkin that shop\nThe brothers cruise on as we Quest, for the check\nCallin up Famous to see, if it's there yet\nNot a bourgeoise, hate the seminar\nIgnorant flip, hey Miss you must jet\nFlex for the funkiest but start to bounce\nMeasure Hip-Hop for weight, by the ounce\nBush on the tush, you're pullin while I push\nPlay me for the punk then puss, feel the pounce\n\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)\n\nIf the papes come yo yo I won't riff\nI just sit down and get, me a spliff\nWith mines I was born, a child of the corn\nMolecules of the land they uplift\nLevels is straight, in fact they're rectified\nAdrenaline now is crazy multiplied\nFour and four is eight, the fraction makes the plate\nI make sure the Tribe is innnnnnnn..\nWith the quickness you bare the witness\nFlexin and pumpin with the fitness\nMovin it - UHH, doin it - UHH\nThose who oppose must hit the ??s-list??\nDoin it and doin it with the whole frame\nLook what's in the mind and not, in the brain\nOn this you can quote, we on a diffy note\nQuest for the future, 'stead of the fame\nOne ninety-one brothers grabbin they thingies\nForgot the name; oh, equivalent to Jimmy\nSlip a little bit, you think I have to quit\nAli Shaheed Muhammad, with the singy-singy\nSlammin with a slammy you front, on the case\nRight or left nut Ali, plays the ace\nDo what you do, flam for a crew\nBonita Applebum blows smoke in Sha's face\nSlang for the ?? I must, if ya have\nDribble hops out giggle yo proper term is laugh\nBrothers who are snakes, I label them as fakes\nInstincts to Travel up the hood path, c'mon\n\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all... (keep, onnnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nIt's like that y'all.. (keep onnnnnnn)\nFreak freak y'all...
