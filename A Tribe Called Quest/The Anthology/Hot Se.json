To all my peoples with the funk\nI'm the undercover brother dump your hoe in the trunk\nSave all the sad songs and the tearjerkers\nNiggaz step up it's the lyrical worker\nThe poems that I create ain't in paper back books\nThe poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks\nMy mental is excelling cuz I dabble in the books\nI'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops\nYo I gets the pickens, I'm such a damn Dickens\nIf you step to this then the plot just thickens\nI'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog\nTo me, your just another MC on the log\nA link on the chain, fluid on the brain\nI boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mardane\nSee I can't maintain, especially if you come back\nI'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah I can do that\nI can also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home\nCuz when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones\nIt's the no-joke pressure, that elevates my mind\nMakes me pick up and go when it's time to drop a rhyme\nMy title is locked, the Abstract poetic\nI'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic\nSo smooth and debonair, especially for the ear\nGotta keep my thing in gear cuz it's evident and clear\nThat I will rock, rock, rock\n",
