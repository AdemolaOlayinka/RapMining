I'm agile plus I'm worth your while.\nOne hundred percent intelligent black child.\nMy optic presentation sizzles the retina.\nHow far must I go to gain respect? Um.\nWell, it's kind of simple, just remain your own\nOr you'll be crazy sad and alone.\nIndustry rule number four thousand and eighty,\nRecord company people are shady.\nSo kids watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack,\nI don't doubt it. Look at how they act.\nOff to better things like a hip-hop forum.\nPass me the rock and I'll storm with the crew and...\nProper. What you say Hammer? Proper.\nRap is not pop, if you call it that then stop.\nNC, y'all check the rhyme y'all.\nSC, y'all check it out y'all.\nVirginia, check the rhyme y'all.\nCheck it out. Out.\nIn London, check the rhyme, y'all.\n",
