We seein life for what it is\n(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids\n(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation\n(Where ya at?)\n\nNow, all that glock totin' trash you talk will not prevail\nIt's stale, you'll either be dead or in jail\nI keeps it realer than the logo on milk\nDenouncin tough guy wannabes that look smoother than silk\nThat's the sound of the man gettin yanked off the stage\nTryin to front like he mad paid\nSuckin so bad, we threw his mama off the train (insane)\nMCs are just givin it all away (OK)\nWho said him know about the Quest type sound?\nMess around and get your ass knocked down (clown)\nI dedicate this to the posers that play hard\nYou wanna hear some rhymes, well come bring your bodyguard\nSo he can peep the worldwide Willie that we display\nLeavin all MCs in complete disarray\nI beez a veteran MC, crushin crews for years\nYou frontin hard, when you softer than the Berenstain Bears\nYeah, chumps be like \"Phife, that ain't fair\"\nFuck outta here, do I look like I care\nCome off my stage, before I grab ya neck and handle ya\nWet ya like punani, then dry you like Canada\nShaheed Muhammad's on the Gemini mixer\nPeace to Derrick Coleman, Mad Max and the Sixers\nI'm cappin hard cause I got this rap shit sold\nFrom Linden Boulevard down to Cascade Road\nYou know my steez, I treat hip hop like a sport\nHoldin down fort up on Martinique Court like...\n\n(Where ya at?) We seein life for what it is\n(Where ya at?) We get this money for these kids\n(Where ya at?) We bout to build the foundation\n(Where ya at?) We gonna start the Zulu Nation\n(Where ya at?) Come on, come on\n(Where ya at?) We gonna put it all together\n(Where ya at?) No matter what the hell the weather\n(Where ya at?)\nUh, uh, mind power\nUh, uh, kickin willie is good, all throughout your whole hood\nBut we gotta start with the spirit first y'all\nMind power\n",
