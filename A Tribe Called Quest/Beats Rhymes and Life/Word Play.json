People really get caught with this on different levels\nPower controls your life\nMoney. The companion of the first. Some people tend to worship\nAnd we know this ain't right.\n\n\nAttitude(attitude) is how I get my point across.\nYou can't call yourself an MC if you know that you're soft.\nAgressive...is how the stage is approached. I burn MCs like toast\nCuz I'm the host with the most.\n\n\nIllin(illin) is what you do when you're assin.\nWhether it be you or all up in your past and...\nCashin...done turned your people corrupt\nIt's six o'clock, girl, you gotta get your weight up\n\n\nSex(sex). Either a man or a woman.\nThis agenda, but when lovers get down\nFroggin. When niggaz try to play roles\nBut when they really need to put that shit background\n\n\nMiserable(miserable) is what your whole crew will be\nIf you're not original and you show no strategy\nHeavenly...is how the track tends to flow\nAnd if you don't know, tell em diggy said so\n\n\nWe livin this cuz it's deep in our bones\nA Tribe Called Quest with this hip hop jones\nSo sit and analyze the lyrical spray\nCuz all it really is is word play(word play)(word)\n\n\nWillie. That's what I kick to get this Millie on a lilly\nNow, I'm packin dimes like Chilli\nStress(stress). That's what I always go through\nCuz it's survival of the fittest on the 192\n\n\nKnowledge. When the mind accept facts\nOn this plane of livin, knowledge be the key, black\nUnderstanding. Gettin a grip on what's revealed\nWhen shit be real, can't give understanding back\n\n\nAnalyze. That's what I do to MCs\nThat be talkin bout they this and that, money please\nEgo. I'm on my own jock skill\nCuz if I don't say I'm the best, tell me who the hell will\n\n\nCheeba smoke y'all. That's what I use to get high\nWhen I'm in a rut and I don't know why\nTry. Yo try again my friend\nCuz you can't see this MC representin Linden\n\n\nFreestyle(freestyle). A true MC trait\nAnd when you do it ill, niggaz respect it as great\nYo, I gotta...\n\n\nWe livin this cuz it's deep in our bones\nA Tribe Called Quest with the hip hop jones\nSo sit and analyze the lyrical spray\nCuz all it really is is word play(word play)\n",
