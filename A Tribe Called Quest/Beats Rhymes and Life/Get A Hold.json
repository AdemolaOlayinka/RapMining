Drifting by(just)totally\n\n\nThe deadly venom, let me start from the beginning\nWe always hittin, so yo, there'll be no extra innings\nAs I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson\nYou be the minor leaguer who sees no action\nThe coming attraction(what!)\nThe main feature\nAnd I'ma greet ya, like a rhymin ass creature\nLurking all up in the dark, unknown parts\nThe brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start\nAnd that's me Akki, as long as the ladies move they bodies\nWe'll have a four-on-two stand\nCuz that happens to be the nature of man\nSexuality, it is the format baby\nAin't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes\nBut I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen\nRespect me for that and let me do my thing(just)\nI said, respect me for that and let me do my thing\n\n\n(Drifting by)You know we gotta get a hold\n(totally) Over the illest drum rolls\n(totally drifting by just...)\n\nYo, how you doin? Let me give you an intro\nMy name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info\nGot the diamond in the back, and the sunroof shit\nThat makes the hardcore MCs resort to being bitch\nAnd I don't give a shit about being wild rich\nJust make me comfortable and I'll deal with it\nYour lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick\nDown to his zealots, upchuck and then spit\nDenouncin my beliefs, well then your wig get split\nLay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit\nYou can take these words and relay it to your click\nTake some time for your mind and get off them head trips\nThe Tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit\nLike the Fourth of July on some firework shit\nMy record company be on some true jerk shit\nBut that's i-ight. Now, I'm on some true work shit\nAnd I'ma make it happen for my whole outfit\n\n\n(Drifting by)You know we got to get control\n(totally)Over the illest drum rolls\n(totally drifting by just...)Third verse\n\nA-yo, we just gettin started\nGot to redirect this vision\nGot the beauty of a flower\nPlus dimensions like a prism\nYour minds are locked down like prison\nY'all really need to go lay down\nCuz positivity has risen\nWe hittin\nYo bust how we too strong to be broken\nOccasional malfunction pressure time\nWe ain't jokin\nFor security we on this run like Logan\nKamaal's doin the hustle\nAnd you backstage voguin\nWe all got flaws\nDon't ever try to think that you perfect\nWe all are human beings\nThere's bullshit at the surface\nSometimes, I mean we rhyme\nDamn, we ain't prophets\nAnd if you think so, you need to stop it\nSo jump back inside your shell\nLet your million dollar thoughts propel\nBut next man don't get jel\nPlaya hate that all carries weight\nThat we don't need\nWe slim with disabilities and\nThick with possibilities\nCuz then you can't move with fertility\nNavigatin with good visibility\nWe put these tunes out in record shop facilities\nLet's strive to get this constant money activity\nWe try to stay on the scene like Fidel\nSo if you get enraged with these names it still rebels\nThere ain't no plan B's\nYo watch, we movin through with plan A\nMoney market doin things the right way\n\n\n(Totally)You know we got to get control\n(Drifting by, just)Over the illest drum roll\n(Totally drifting by just...)\n(Totally just(x2), Drifting by in background)\nYo bust it out section, section.\nSection Linden Boulevard\nSection on Merrick\nSection the whole Jamaica\nSection on Flushing\nSection in Bed-Stiduy\n",
