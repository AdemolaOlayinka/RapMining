Will Laura fuck Urkel?\nNever, here comes the funk, smell the aroma\nKid, my shit's the bomb, ask my peeps from Oklahoma\n\n\nTo all my people across the state who sit back and contemplate\nMotivate, I motivate, I motivate y'all\nTo all my people across the land who get stuck in great sand\nMotivate, I motivate y'all\nTo all my peoples everywhere throw your mitts in the air\nMotivate, motivate, motivate, motivate\nCan't do nuthin for your frontin, get involved and do somethin\nMotivate, motivate, I motivate, I motivate, I moti...\n",
