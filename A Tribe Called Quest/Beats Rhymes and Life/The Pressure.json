Is you proper?\nIt's time we turned the tables of this hip-hop fable\nI be strivin yo', tryna bang these joints out my skillet\nAnd fulfil it, think about these kids, we can't kill it\n\n\n\nNow every dog has his day, but eff that, it's my year\nAll you gat pullin' MC's could never come near\nAll that bogus type chatter, please put it to rest\nIt's the Phifer from Quest leavin' venues a mess\nSo I even start to (Rap) when you know you have no (Haps)\nWit' your simpleton (Lyrics), your light-hearted (Act)\nStep back, me no have no time for dat\nI'm blowin' up the spot for all you ras clot idi-ots\nIn a world where you have like a zillion MC's\nNinety percent of all you suckers have filthy LPs\nBitch this, trick that, come on, act like you know\nI be that up north MC who never chose to play the down-low\n(His name is Phife Dawg) I label myself as The Boss (True dat)\nSame height as Little Vicious, yet I'm shorter than Kriss Kross\nQueens representation, son, you know how we do\nWhile Light' and Sha, they represent BK to the fullest\nI be the sidekick to The Abstract, so get ready for combat\nYo, what about about them biters? Errr! Me not like that\nMy motto is to wreck shop, I do it on the non-stop\nCome on party people, you must give me my props\nCos y'all know good and damn well that the style has been mastered\nSo head for the border you peasy-haired bastards\nBefore I start to put it on ya, come on now, must I warn ya?\nQueens is in the house so all MC's go hold their corner\n\n\n\nWe feelin' pressures in here\nYou know we feelin' pressures\nFeelin' pressures in here\nYou know we feelin' pressures\nWe gotta stand clear\nJus' gotta stand clear\nGotta gotta stand clear of the pressure\nThe what?\n",
