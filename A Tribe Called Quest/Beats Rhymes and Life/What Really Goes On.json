I doubt that, very highly\nWe got jewels and Mo and the life is tight rowdy\nEverybody lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee\nLet's make these institutions, body slam for the smitties\nI got girls with plenty tails, smarts and big (titties)\nAnd they all stressin me, yo, really?\nWhat really goes on? (James Brown: I don't know)\n\n\n\n\nOne is for the beat and the two is for the rhyme\nThree is for the life, now we on this incline\nNever catch this kid stickin forks in swine\nNever ran my gibs in nuthin less than a dime\nA few of my brothas did that asshole one time\nStrivin miss sunrise, sometimes is known as crime\nThe three twenty-five got that Windex shine\nAnd when I shot skelly, I had my boxes in lines\nAll I wanna do is live life and be fair\nI used to stress girls with long legs and long hair\nNow, I want a woman with a spiritual flair\nGod will never make it too hard for me to bare\nI'm hungry like a derelict whose stays in the diluse\nSome can count me out, but yo, I doubt that I lose\nThe Westernized world got our minds confused\nYou frontin on me, ak, then you don't get bruised\nThe funny style cats, they be playin games like Chucky\nGovernment officials shoot their same old...\nMade of devil agents a.k.a. the devil flunky\nStiff (ass) squares gettin mad cuz we funky\nThis the crap game, then we got the top rolls\nThe positive jumps the negative like frogs\nResentin evil vibes, yo, that (shit) is at the morgue\nWe celebrate laughin down in at the smorgas borg\nYou still lookin (shitty) like a to' down committee\nLet's make this institution, buy the land for the smitties\nI got girls with tails, plenty smarts and big (titties)\nAnd they all stressin me...really\n",
