Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames\n(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend\n\nDon't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream\nYour whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember\nShatan got you caught in the storms of December\nAnd brothers on the block packin nines like September\nCrazy situations keeps pockets on slender\n\nYo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new\nI'm splurgin on these Reebok joints for shorty boo\n\nAll of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin\nTalkin out they joints but they wasn't sayin nuttin\nMy hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly\n(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up\nBut I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride\nBecause I'm positive it seems that negative dies\n\nYo we was at the dice game makin these cats look silly\nFlamin, steady runnin off at the Willie\n\nI had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough\nI gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow\nShook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'\nKept my eyeballs scopin for them pigs po-po\nI got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'\nBut I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo\n\nAnd I was doin it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike\nOne roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite\n\nYo I know the feelin, when you feelin like a villain\nYou be havin good thoughts but the evils be revealin\nand the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)\nJealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff\nWe gotta hold it down so we can move on past\nall adversities, so we can get through fast, like that\n\n\n\n\n\nYou got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)\nYour baby's on the way (and you don't know who)\nAnd crosstown niggaz tryin to (bust at you)\nAiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)\nSo frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact\nwith a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked\nThe switch hittin Queens, niggaz liquid sword spittin\nwith raw poppy, and now your first love is krill\nYour vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover\nTried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover\nAnd all I want is my laceration of the pie\nto get this whip cream before the water runs dry\nNiggaz flashdancin yo I don't know why\nYou're sick of snitchin, she got you cruisin to the pokey\nlike Smokey, the stress be tryin to squeeze out a homey\nWhile I be tryin to get star status like Shinobi\nSo we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's\nAnd all I want, is the world to know my steez\nThese money hungry niggaz is seven thirty\nAnd got me stressed out like these frog MC's\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't worry we gon make it (gonna make it)\nDon't worry we gon make it (oh yeah)\nDon't worry we gon make it (gonna make it)\nWe gon make it (gotta make it)\nDon't worry we gon make it (gotta make it)\nWe're gonna make it (we gotta make it)\nDon't worry we gon make it (we gonna make it)\nWe gonna make it (ohhhhhhh)\nDon't worry we gon make it (ohhhhhhh)\nDon't worry we gon make it (gonna make it)\nDon't worry we gon make it (ohhhhhhh)\nWe gon make it (ahaowwhwwww)\nDon't worry we gon make it (ahahwwww)\nI know we gonna make it (we're gonna make it)\nC'mon baby we gon make it (yeahhhh)\nWe gon make it (yeahhahhahhhh)\nDon't worry we gon make it (we're gonna make it)\nWe've gotta make it (we've gotta make it)\nWe've gotta make it (oh yeah)\nKnow we're gonna make it\nWe're gonna make it, gonna make it, we gotta make it, know we gonna make it...\n",
