What they wanna do?\nYou better call Mr. Babyface, so he can bring out _The Cool in You_\nor it'll be a sad love song being sung by Toni Braxton\nAnd I'll dissect you like a fraction\nOh, you wannabe top cat MC's, I'll pop you like a zit\nYou wanna be the champ, you more like Chief Some-shit\nBig up myself everytime when it comes to this\nMC's be runnin scared as if they're watchin the Exorcist\nI kick more game than a crackhead from Hempstead\nMy styles are milk, man, you'd think that I was breast fed\nYou know the steelo when the diggy Dawg is on the scene\nI dedicate this to all the MC's outta Queens\nthat goes for Onyx, LL, Run-D.M.C.\nAkinyele, Nasty Nas and the Extra P\nYou need a chart, straight up and down man, there ain't no other\nNuff respect to all my peeps that made the album cover\nYo, Tip don't worry Dunn you know I get the party jumpin\nGet on the mic and break em off a lil lil sumthin\nYo, Tip don't worry Dunn you know I get the party jumpin\nGet on the mic and break em off a lil lil sumthin (Ooohh...)\n\n\"Oh my God!\"\n\n\nLa, la, la, la..\nDoop, doo, do, do..\nLa, la, la, la..\nShooby-doop, do, do..\nLa, la, la, la..\nShooby-doo, do, do..\nYou know I'm on the other, for the top 40\nHaha, you gotta do it like this..\n\nWe got the funk doody don shit, clearly it's the bomb shit\nSo recognize me, kids memorize me\nEveryday, I be scroungin, really, I be loungin\nI play the down low, very very incognito\nAries is my sign, I know that I can rhyme\nSometimes I rhyme in riddles, plus I make the hunnies wiggle\nIntellect is the major, some heads like to wager\nThe skills on the hill, overlookin dollar bills\nMan, ya crazy, thinkin you can phase me\nThe Ab doesn't study near nonsense money\nLife seems to meet me, MC's seem too cheesy\nWith they doody ass renditions of defeatin competition\nI rock to the roll man, yes, I'm a soul man\nBet'cha bottom dolla, Vinia will make ya holla\nAs ya stand at attention, did I forget to mention\nMC's will give me twenty, if I sense that they act funny\nLyrics are abundant, right there, I sound redundant\nJust mentionin the fact, that the area is fat\nI dwell in the unda, so hunny, it's no wonder\nThat I get plenty of tail, well I even get white\nI'ma bet hittin head crack, there money, take that\nBreakin niggaz off, cut their bank, then I'm off\nWhile my Nik'es match my lil hat, beat joint is mad fat\nGot the cutter of the box if a kid thinks he's ox\nFor tier means creator, the poetry relator\nIt's hemp, like Betsy Ross, let me tell you who's the boss\n\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\") smooth it y'all\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\nLa, la, la.. ( \"Oh my God!\")\n\nQueens got a Zoo\nBrooklyn got a Zoo\nBronx got a Zoo\nLong Island got a Zoo\nLong Island.. got the zone\nJersey got a Zoo\nPhilly got a Zoo\nMilwaukee got a Zoo\nL.A. got a Zoo\nOaktown got the zone\n\nLa, la, la..\nSee, I like to get down Jack\n",
