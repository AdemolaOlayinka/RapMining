You can't escape\nWhen the Tribe is in the house, that means nobody is safe\nHow can a reverend preach, when a rev can't define\nThe music of our youth from 1979\nWe rap about what we see, meaning reality\n>From people bustin caps and like Mandela bein free\nNot every MC be with the negativity\nWe have a slew of rappers pushin positivity\nHip hop will never die yo, it's all about the rap\nSo Marion Barry smokin crack, let's preach about that\nThe trash you talk won't matter, that old bogus chatter\nThe more that you condemn us, it only makes us phatter\nWhen I talk, I know I'm talkin for you poppers all around\nYou know you love the sound, we gets down\n\n\n\n\nI'm the cherry on the top of yo ice cream\nI'm the wish you thought inside your dream\nListen to the way we pulsate the jam\nI'm the nigga here with the mic in hand\nStyles that we present are just a few\nTo do away with you and your hum drum crew\nThis is '93 and the shit is real\nBlack people unite and put down your steel\nLadies make a forum on your sexual drive\nDevoted to your lover and make it thrive\nThe riff was of F, I'm a hip hop body\nRelease the energy like the force of a shotty\nStandin on the wall with my Polo on\nTalkin to the girl with the Liz Claiborne\nKeep the poetry in my black knapsack\nGot my Timbo horse and my Doublemint pack\nHit the city streets to enhance my soul\nI can kick a rhyme over ill drum rolls\nWith a kick, snare, kicks and high hat\nSkilled in the trade of that old boom bap\nI can do a trick with the opposite breed\nI used to down 40s and smoke grain weed\nNow, I'm doin shows with half loot down\nNow it's time for me to take ya uptown\n\nIt's like that man, it's like that (yes!)\nIt's like this, Shaheed!\n\n\n\"Why waste time on the microphone\n",
