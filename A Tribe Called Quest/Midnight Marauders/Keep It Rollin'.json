Peace to Ike Love\n(Sup? Hah hah) and the rest of the crew (Whassup?)\n(Whassup?) I meet you guys in front the cleaners\nBring the blunts and the brew so\n\n\n\nWhassup kids? The Ab is speaking from the moon\nThanks for your support, aiyyo I'll be home soon\nBut the only thing I ask when I return from my task\nIs a whole bunch of beats and a Blass full of ass\nMy fist stands firm because I'm, black and solid\nI open up your pores like a plate full of collards\nC'mon take it easy wouldya, easy easy\nI'm up in the gulley, that's when I am her Buddy\nShe told me pull her hair, I did, it drove her nutty\nFilled up the hole like spackle or I mean putty\nWhen we over joints like this we never cruddy\nExtra P hooked the beat, and kids it feels luh-huh-ovely\nCheck it out, cause my conception is immaculate\nA bachelor, lookin for a bachlelorette\nBack to you MC's, this is what your gonna get\nA first degree burn from my man Ken's cigarette\nI hope you like Malboro, Paul you know we thorough like Denver\nThe beat feels like a never-ender\nBut all things good must, so I won't sweat it\nDrop the C's for the youthful crew, I hope you get it\nAs I stand, grip this mic inside my hand\nBoy I smack you up, like I was your old grand\nso respect yourself Son, and come and gimme love\nOnce again the Ab is who you think of\nSo chill with the beef money, we got a Jetti\n\n\n\nIt's Extra P and yo Tip I'm bout to set it\non the country once again here to win\nI'm Uptown chillin, takin in this grand master Vic blend\nfrom the projects, the PJ's, fuck them two DJ's\nSelf mission, I had her in the ill position\nSaying \"Large youse the soul brother that I'd like to\neff with for the rest of my life\" yeah yeah now check the method\nAs I, proceed with what you need like Akinyele\nA whip looks complete when the tires say Firelli\nFunk monkey, one rapper fell off, now he's a junkie\nThere's 8 Million Stories in the city it's a pity\nDon't fuck with the skins if she's trying to act shitty\nShout to the Guru, Primo and Zulu Zulu\nNation, was on a vacation, in the ghetto\nYo Ras slow your roll I'm bout to bag this here's metal\nRapper Nas on topic, seems we gonna rock it\nQueens represent, buy the album when I drop it (drop it)\n",
