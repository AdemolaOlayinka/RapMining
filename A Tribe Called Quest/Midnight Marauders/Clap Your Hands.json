Squirrel\nThe worst thing in the world is a sucka MC\nFavorite rap group in the world is EPMD\nCan't forget the De La, the two originality\nAnd if I ever went solo, my favorite MC would be me\nPhife Dawg up in the house, I give a shout out to Snoopy\nPeace to all the Questers, to hell with the groupies\nLike um, Ralph up to Potsie, Brooklyn to Dodger\nLaverne to Shirley, Rerun to Roger\nRen to the Stimpy, Laurel to Hardy\nQ-Tip and Phifer, they mashed up the party\nKick the rhymes and more rhymes\nKick the beats and more beats\nWe'll have you scratchin in your head, like trying all techniques\nFor those who wanna oppose, just take a stand\nBut for now, just shut your shit and clap your hands\n\n\n\n\nYou just wanna dance man, then clap your hands\nIf you venture up the wrong road, then the circumstance...\nWill be crucial, I got hundreds of rhymes that'll suit you\nSo listen\nThe Abstract intuition is very very worthy\nI can feel ya out from Russia to Jersey\nCan't understand, the underground, it gets deep\nThe low, the Nikes, the links, the jeeps\nThe women, the lingo and all the other goods\nPeace to the hoods, that keep my shit on play\nPlease don't do the mute when you hear me on the juke\nBrothas know my angle, it's the Star-Spangled black banner\nHook up the beats at the funk manner\nIf want a roll, then dough I be rakin\nThe scope is on the world, cuz it's mine for the takin\nYou know I'm gonna do it\nMy shit is rock solid, but it flows like fluid\nChemists get confused of my ill composition\nThis is the third of the new Tribe addition\nMCs be swingin, but alot of them be missin\nSo shut your bloodclot and listen\nCuz I'm bringin you the ill rendition\nI'd like to send this out to the L.E.S.\nGotta alot of rhythm and style and finesse\nCome here love, hot sex on a plat\nAnd when your done with that then clap\n",
