Kelly (bust a rhyme)\nToday's a hip-hop draft will I be top-seeded? (uhh)\nWorked too frickin hard while all the rest were gettin weeded\nSteady kickin styles so I can reach that other level (uh)\nDon't worry about gettin gassed I push the pedal to the metal\nAlways wanted this cause it surely beats a scramble (right)\nI'm Jordan with the mic, huh, wanna gamble? (mmm)\nThis I dedicate to all the honiest that be bogle-in\nCause at the end of the night y'know Malik will have his Trojans\nBut when it comes to nights like this I got lyrics to go\n\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nLyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out y'all\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it out here we go!\n\n\nPlease proceed with caution cause the lyricist is fatal\nI can kick your little monkey ass like Kato (yes dread, uhh)\nFormulate your rhymes like a child forms Play-Doh (right)\nCalm and serene like the study was tayo\nPoetry machine with correct mechanisms\nImmune to disease I defeat organisms\nthat are waitin in my path, I overstep the critters\nGive your ass the willies and your moms'll get the jitters (uh)\nWinners turn to losers, losers are forgotten\nTangle in my fore with, hopes that I stop rockin\nNever will that happen only if it is permitted (uhh)\nWait... I think somebody shitted (c'mon)\nI guess that will be me cause I'm the only one MCin\nI go for what I know doin a show for human beings\nAlways try to lead yo never will I follow\nBlowin up the spot like Fred did to Rollo\nAnd when it comes to days like this, I got lyrics to go\n\nCheck it out y'all\n(Lyrics to go) It's like that y'all\nI got lyrics to go\nEverybody\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah c'mon now\nI got lyrics to go\nAh check it out y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that now\nI got lyrics to go\nEverybody\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah c'mon now\nI got lyrics to go\nCheck it out y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) It's like that now\nI got lyrics to go\nC'mon y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Everybody\nI got lyrics to go\nIt's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Check it out now\nI got lyrics to go\nAh c'mon y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Everybody\nI got lyrics to go\nIt's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Check it out now\nI got lyrics to go\nIt's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Every-bo-ty\nI got lyrics to go\nIt's like that y'all\n(I got lyrics to go) Ah check it out now\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it now\nIt's like that y'all\nCheck it now\nIt goes... uhh\n",
