I'm goin to smack her up\nI got the tickets for the Knicks and she cold stood me up\nI need to hit a hunny off yo drill pas me the phone\nPulled out my hooker hoes, oh yo Sheela's home\nSteady smiling like a mother yo I'm wrecked to bone\nWent down on hun, she's in the red zone\nStressed out more than one could ever be\nForever trying to clear the sample for my new LP\nEverybody knows I go to Georgia often\nGot on a flight then I ended up in Boston\nWith all these trials and tribulations yo I've been affected\nAnd to top it off, Starks got ejected\n\n\nJust last week my girl was stressing me\nNow her best friend be underssing me\nWell I was lovin her by the moon lit\nNow I'm tricking on her like Kinte'\nBought a bag of izm from the smoke shop\nWalking towards the car, here come the damn cops\nNow I'm station bound for the thai sticks\nI bought it for my man, I don't believe this shit\nCoach sat me down from the ball team\nCause I was breakin niggaz on the inseams\nSome niggas cross town was trying to stick me\nAll I had was shorts, a dollar fifty\nPicked up this gir in the hoopty\nJust because of her rhymes she tried to soup me\nPay for this and pay for that loot for nails and hair\nWho the hell do you think I am, Mr. Belvedere?\nGo and get a bloddy job then can we look cute\nEven if you get me boots, you'll neva see my loot\nShe wasn't even all of that just anothe hooker\nTook the journey that ass way, quick like Chucky Booker\nSometimes you got put the hoes in their freakin place\nJust move from in front me with your botty face!\nMy man Mohammed in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nZulu Nation in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nSub Rock is in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nMy man Skeff is in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nJarobi White is in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nBob Power in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nMy man Eric in the house, huh {come on, come on}\nMy man Lytcha in the house, huh {come on, come on}\n(Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me...
