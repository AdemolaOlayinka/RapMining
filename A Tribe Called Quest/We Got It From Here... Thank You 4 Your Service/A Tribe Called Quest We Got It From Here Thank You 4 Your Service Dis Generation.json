Imbibing on impeccable grass\nI be in NYC waiting for that law to pass\nPass shit, been waiting for a Jet's title since last\nRichard Todd, Todd Bowles, gang green on that ass\nMagic Mike on the mic, David Blain, Douglass Henning\nIn the church of Busta Rhymes, it's my sermon you're getting\nHorizontal spittin', I'm the exorcist of your writtens\nDon't interrupt me, nigga, sorry, that's a sin unforgiven\nLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen\nB-b-b-b-b-b-but wait\nJust spit the package, dry it, bag up the wet\nThis mad city's not a game, easy, quiet on set, Phife\nStudent of the past trailblazing a daze\nNot acknowledging a trend or swept up in a phase\nWe still the highest of commodity grade\nAnd you could get it, get it, get it, get it today\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nDis generation, dis generation, dis generation\nRules di nation\nThis is our generation, generation, uh huh, yeah\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh\nThis our generation, generation, uh huh\n",
