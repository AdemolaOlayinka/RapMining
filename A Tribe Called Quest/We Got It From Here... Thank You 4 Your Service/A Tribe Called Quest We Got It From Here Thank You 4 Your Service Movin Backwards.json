I was content being my own man\nUp until that night ill-fated, walking home I was faded\nPo puts braces on my wrist like he was clapping his hands\nHow demeaning, y'all? Who could be blind to racism?\nBring bro bro to me for the brotherly baptism\nInstead of slaps, give him the dose of Ab wisdom\nHe'll make it out of the jungle some way\nHey, it's figurative, not a real place you stay\nAy, it's mind state filled with muck and malaise\nUh, I got direction without using Waze\nSubmitting myself to praying these days\nYeah, moonwalking backwards, it's only for stage\n\nFeds lining up in riot gear\nAnd everybody's hands in the air\nFour-five so get your ass found somewhere\nCaught between hope and despair\nSay it loud, what it take to make my niggas listen\nSomebody just give me\nSomebody just give me\nSomebody just give me\nCool out, chill out nigga, I'm cool\nCool out nigga, nah, nigga I'm through\nHead down, ain't no tellin' what you gon' do\n(Somebody just give me\u2014\nSomebody just give me\u2014\nSomebody just give me direction\nI don't want to move backwards, no\nCops killing us niggas everywhere\nMaybe we should get some guns too)\nShe come around every now and a few\n(Man, I hope she really loves you)\nLiving high ain't hard to do\n(She'll be in the clouds somewhere\nFeeling fresh, I strut your bitches out of here\nMight even take your broad too\nOops, I'm 'bout to get kicked out here\nTell mama I'mma slide through)\nStealer, I'm trying to get out of here\nBut stuck up in the same room\n(Too many open miles in here\nSick of eating out at drive through)\nHahaha, look at this motherfucker\n",
