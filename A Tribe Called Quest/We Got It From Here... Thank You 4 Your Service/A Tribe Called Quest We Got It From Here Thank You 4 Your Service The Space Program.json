    "lyrics": "I'mma deal with a bigger insult, man\nThe heat, the heat, the heat, the heat\nIt's comin' down hard\nWe've got to get our shit together\nIt's time to go left and not right\nGotta get it together forever\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet's get it together, come on let's make it\nGotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it\nTo make something happen, to make something happen\nTo make something happen, let's make something happen\nWord to Phifer\nGonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco\nChilling with the gold microphone cords\nAnd we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour\n'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar\nAnd promoters try to hit us with the art of war\nWe about our business, we not quitters\nNot bullshitters, we deliver\u2014we go-get it\nDon't be bitter 'cause we not just niggas\nJarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth\nAin't nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off\nHardest spit in the city y'all niggas spitting kitten soft\nConfused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost\nThey planning for our future\nNone of our people involved\nPouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off\nCracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov\nMolotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off\nIt always seems the poorest persons\nAre people forsaken, dawg\nNo Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons\nOn the captain's log\nThey'd rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog\nMass un-blackening, it's happening, you feel it y'all?\nRather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars\nLeave us where we are so they can play among the stars\nThey taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing\nWhat, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going\nReputation ain't glowing, reparations ain't flowing\nIf you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing\nUsed to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in\nAnd the car stereo where they would promote the show\nOptimistic little brother with a hope you know\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain't a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck here, nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain't a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck here nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain't a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck here, nigga\n(Move on to the stars)\nThere ain't a space program for niggas\nYeah, you stuck, stuck, stuck\n(Move on to the stars)\nSit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day\nAll these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways\nAnd the president's refined, in her wing she's confined\nWith about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine\nCarolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs\nTo the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine\nNow, people on top of people, feels like we can't breathe\nPut so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave\nPut it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face\nThese notions and ideas and citizens live in space\nI chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all\nTakes money to get it running and money for trees to fall\nImagine for one second all the people are colored, please\nImagine for one second all the people in poverty\nNo matter the skin tone, culture or time zone\nThink the ones who got it\nWould even think to throw you a bone?\nMoved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?\nNah cypher, probably no place to\nImagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude\nImagine if this shit was really talkin' about space, dude\nTime to go left and not right\nGotta get it together forever\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformers, won't hear the quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one-hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nMake make make\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together forever\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one-hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one-hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nMake make make\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together forever\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one-hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nGotta get it together for brothers\nGotta get it together for sisters\nFor mothers and fathers and dead niggas\nFor non-conformists, one-hitter quitters\nFor Tyson types and Che figures\nMake, make, make\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nLet's make somethin' happen, let's make somethin' happen\nThe danger must be growing\nFor the rowers keep on rowing\nAnd they're certainly not showing\nAny signs that they are slowing!\n\"We're there!\"\n\"Where?\"\n\"Here!\"\nA small step for mankind\nBut a giant step for us\nOompa, loompa, doopa dee doo\nI've got another puzzle for you\n",
