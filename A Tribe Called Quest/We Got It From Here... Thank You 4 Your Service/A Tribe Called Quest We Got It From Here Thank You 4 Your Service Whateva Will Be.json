Would you prefer that?\nFourth grade mean level but he knows how to rap\nAre you amused by our struggles? The English that's broken?\nThe weed that I'm smokin'? The guns that I'm totin'?\nThe drugs that I'm sellin'? No need for improvement\nFuck you and who you think I should be, forward movement\nMelanin is shrouded in complexity\nBrain charge shocking like 'lectricity\nMouth translate happens organically\nThe media relates to what it thinks it sees\nJudging steps in shoes from a path they never walked\nShot down in a blaze over phrases, how they talk\nDark skin, walk with a bop, a trade feelin'\nI'm chillin', feelin' down at a DNA crime buildin'\nSupplement the youth, hypersexualizing women\nThey ain't got the strong enough hold, so they built a prison\nPumping false religion to all of these niggas' systems\nEvery voice devoid of the truth\nCome on, listen\nLook at this, look at this\nWhatever will be will be\nLike a billionaire investin' in a nigga's dreams\nCertainly a head scratcher, like Pac and Big's killas capture\nOr a women with the wisdom who's leadin' the way\nThe rarity is in the rear, but never today\nMan, picture a PD lettin' good records play\nOn the strength of what it is, not the finesse of your biz\nAnd your lady calls you dirty, her dirts under rugs\nYou'll find out only if she tells you, take her kiss and hug, cuz\nIn the answer for cancer in a prodigious kid's mind\nYes, the government will for learning is feed for everyone\nAnd from that lie, your leaders will rise in the eyes\nOf despair and adversity in some universal sense will be true\nEverybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'\nBut whatever's gonna be will be\nEverybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'\nBut whatever's gonna be will be\nSome will dash to the mountain, some will crawl\nAnd the weakest amongst them, they will fall\nBut the strongest in fate, they will stand tall\nEverybody runnin' when they see the storm's comin'\nBut whatever's gonna be will be\n\nI just wanna feel as liberated as lions in Liberia\n'Cause recently my heart turned cold as Siberia\n'Cause everywhere I go, bein' cold is the criteria\nLet's see how well you know all your Tribe trivia\nGreen and the white, we servin' that Nigeria\nNorth side of Queens, one-nine-two is the area\nThis is for my dawgs from Shih Tzus to Terriers\nFuck it, it's showtime, Tip, make sure they hearin' ya\n",
