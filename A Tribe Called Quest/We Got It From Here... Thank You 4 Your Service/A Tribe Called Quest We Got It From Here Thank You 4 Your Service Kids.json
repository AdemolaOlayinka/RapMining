For real (For real)\nKids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) For real (For real?) For real (For real)\n\nI don't wanna get up now, I don't wanna go to school\nI don't wanna be the best, don't wanna follow rules\nMom, I think you fuckin' lied to me\nThree stacks said all this shit is fantasy\nIt's my time, gon' put a little life to it\nIf life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it\nI see it like a kiddie on the carousel\nIf I 'url while I go around, what the hell\nAnd that went well, so I'm compelled\nTo have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel\nMy young nigga motto was, \"Fuck it, I'm already grown\"\nAnd I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home\nThat petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough\nIt's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo\nHe cognizant of a nigga ride and die\nI see us getting money through my green eyes\n\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) For real (For real?) For real (For real)\n\nYeah, all the kids, all the what, uh\nYeah, all the badass kids, uh\nKids, say I'm the shit\nI'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries\nThe spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits\nAnd girls scout thin mints\nPardon my penmanship, but oh shit\nFeel like I'm hungry now again\nAnd I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted\nAnd my mom and my pop, they just grin\nAnd empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies\nBut too bad they can't get back they 'member whens\nThem grown-up stories don't work\nIn the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in\nAnd while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids\nFuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up\nThey stood on the corner\nLike you once upon a, time\nAnd probably felt like a loner\nAnd smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona\nSo when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning\nComplaining that you always moaning\nNever saying good morning\nStorming out my house\nAnd slamming doors like you paying bills\nThey been through it too, though\nThey were kids like you, though\nBut what if they knew though\nAnd hit you with the cheat code\nTo a game you just start playing, no extra man\nLeave you reckless on the court\nWith no high percentage shot\nJust a bunch of, \"You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got\"\nYeah, it look a little different on a yacht\nBut ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking\nI love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting\nLike a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty\nShit, their blood pressure high, why?\nThey don't play no more, probably\n\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n(Kids) Kids, don't you know how all this shit is fantasy?\n",
