You wanna hold a congressional hearing on this shit?\nC'mon, Pop, quit!\n\nThis is how we is when it comes to the biz\nOff-point, off-centered\nand when you point it out, he gets ill-tempered\nPromoter of the show's pissed cause the spot had a curfew\nbut Hurricane Whitter blew through\nand made the mess of the date (Yeah, I got here late, and?)\nWe only did four songs, 'spose to do more songs\nNow Ken-doo dealin with the riot and the venue, yeah\n\n\nCrazy.. got this shit right here, on page 63\nAiyyo, little kid's sis insists she knows me\nBackstage access, aspiring actress\nShe gon' be the candidate to get this caucus\nOf course my campaign is interrupted\nJacob's fury, he's wearing a helmet\nPenile pad like he's Mr. Cockney\nI ain't buyin it, he can't sell it\nI'll redial Madlock, the verdict is sloppy\nWe used to split the rations, trios m\u00e9nages\nBut now I got a private car parked garages\nAll on my front seat, he playin like bumper cars\n(I think yo' bitch likes me!) Nigga she's neither one of ours\nHe on the bitch strong so I'ma play passive\nNow she sayin she gotta go home - YOU BASTARD!\nDamn, I'm in the gooddamn dirt like a shovel\noutta work with a pay stub and earnin NO love\n\n\nOh yeah I'll open the book!\nYeah let me open it for you\nI'll turn to the page for you motherfucker\nIt's right here! Look right here!\nIt's like the harmonica sounds of black clouds around\nWord around the campfire you said I'm a tramp buyer\nNigga, I don't pay for hoes!\nUnlike you who disappears for DAYS for hoes\n\nWell here go Captain Paper-Frozen, Salad-That's-Frosty\nThe only dude in the group with a personal glossy\nPersonal transport, champion hand sport\nCaught him yankin the cord, this dude is boss\n\nAnd the Lord won't save us even though we need saving\nCan't even wrestle it, now it's all desolate\nLike B.B. said, \"The thrill is dead\"\nAnd the afterlife, it's trife to stay in the red\n\nBut I'm stayin ahead, one lesson to thank you\nStow a skunk in the street cred and one in the bank too\nFar gone but ain't far enough to see through\nWord is you did a solo album with your people\nBut life ain't that Pop, you ain't no show stopper\nSend the boys over to crown you when-\n\nHey what the fuck you just say? Yo stop the tape!\nYo, WHAT THE FUCK YOU JUST SAY?!\n\nNigga, I said what you heard!\n\nOh, uh-huh.. please...\nand WHAT THE FUCK DID I JUST HEAR?\n\nOh, it's like that Pop?\n...It's on now\n",
