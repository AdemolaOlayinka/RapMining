What did I tell niggaz?\nI told y'all niggaz this deal was comin thru\nI told y'all we was gon' get this muh'fuckin money\n(Looks like we made it..) I'm tellin you, we the FUCK outta here\nFuck err'thing else, we outta here!\n(Looks like we made it..)\nFuck all this college shit, leave all that shit behind!\nWe the fuck out! We the fuck out\n(Looks like we made it..) Don't even pack a bag\nLet's get the fuck outta here NOW! Get the money, let's GO!\n\n(Looks like we made it..) Yeah, no longer throwin back\nfrom burgers from outta Mickey's arches\n(Look like I made it..)\nI now eat the pricey seafood with all my starches\n(Look like I made it..) And even when it's cloudy\nI got some sunshine for the pocket\n(Look like I made it..) Smashed the Mazda\nSo for my bro, the Range Rover I copped it\n\n(Look like I made it..) See Whitter got plans\nto see a different landscape in his life\n(Look like I made it..) Save the diet for when I'm dead and gone\nI'm tryin to eat cake in this life\n(Look like I made it..) Put on airs and walk through the mall\n'til we can't walk through them all\n(Look like I made it..) Cop four-door 44s'\nand put my fam up in it all\n\n(Looks like we made it..) I'm gonna find my chance again\n(Looks like we made it..) and seal this rhyme\n(Looks like we made it..) I'm gonna sort my times again\n(Looks like we made it..) Feelin good, seekin things\nand hold my wins in liii-iii-ine (Looks like we made it...)\n\n(Look like I made it..)\nAdd to the list to assist them rappers, who spit live bars\n\n(Look like I made it..) Down with them constellations\nWe stayin in nothin less than five stars\n(Look like I made it..) Yes, won't even feel stressed\nat the poker game when I blow money (easy!)\n\nNow we are here claimin, like Marlon and Damon\n(Mo' Money, Mo' Money)\n\n(Look like I made it..)\nAnd I'm gon' get a fatty each night, make her say daddy each night\n\n(Look like I made it..) Say I reach for the stars\nand stretchin my arms, tryin to get my reach right\n\n(Look like I made it..)\nThe whole team plays, we cop haze outta mayonnaise jars\n\n(Look like I made it..)\nWant and boutiques goin to shop like there's no tomorrow\n\n\n(Looks like I made it..)\nPop Life and Bacardi make the life of the party last long\n(Look like I made it..)\nSpillin drinks everywhere got 'em like (\"What's... wrong?\")\nCheck it out (Look like I made it..)\nAnd it feels good, puttin money back in my city\n(LOOK LIKE..)\nLil' shorty now feelin inspired like a little train\nthat goes (Chitty Chitty BANG BANG!)\n\n(Look like I made it..)\nExecutive plush the back of the bus\nPuttin work in the streets\n(Look like I made it..) And momma can sleep\nand get the late hours off her feet\n(Look like I made it..) Fuck grams\nI'm tryin to hold fans I don't even know yet\n(Look like I made it..) Whole lotta chances and\nchecks we're tryin to get\n\n(Looks like we made it..)\n\nI had a vision of a golden lucky dream\nCharmed out the way that I could see\nI saw a lucky charm that made it oh so sweet\nI know I'm here to stay, to see, to feel\nBut something's got me holdin on\nSomething's got me sweet\nLooks like we make iiiit\nLooks like we made iiiit\n(Looks like we made it..)\n",
