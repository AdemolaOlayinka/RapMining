First Serve's the best yet\nCan I kick a hole in the speaker and then jet?\nMy nigga yes you can, First Serve's the best kept!\n\nI play the intro, middle, ending back to the intro\nReborn to bring NEW beginnings\nHow many lives, have you ran through?\nI think I'm on number five, came back strivin\nfor the same thing, the GAME thing\nMicrophone remain king, yeah my need\nthey say it's in the blood, and in my thoughts as well\nSince the days of the, ways of the walk\nthrough the park in the BX, me and D got next\nVerbal push-ups, titles, concepts, beats\nYo D, it's time to eat!\n\n..And with this gravy\nMake fritters out of these tater sacks, you quarterbacks\nought to back it up two yards, we bought it back\nThat old chord mic's the prototype\nconnect it like Siamese deep in the work\nSweat a Hi-C packet a day, now sip on that\n\n(\"Let me be\") At the front of the line\n(\"It was plain to see\") Cause it's our time\n(\"It's over now\") in bright lights surrounded by skirts\n(\"You had me found, you shot me down\")\nPop Life & Deen Whitter, we puttin in work!\nWork! Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!)\nWork! Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!)\nWork! (Yeah!) Work (Yeah!) Work! (Yeah!!) Work! (Yeah!!)\nWork! (Yeah!!) Work! (Yeah!!) Work (Yeah!!) Work! (Yeah!!)\nWORK WORK WORK!\n\nCan't a monkey stop us in this bar game\nThe guitar lickin the far lane\nYo I got crazy visions! (Nigga, put 'em on paper!)\nThe contracts, contacts puffin haze per page\nand Almanac of ideas for five years\nBook stick it in that \"I so solemnly swear\" joint\nEconomy scare point (Yo, studio costs is for horses!)\nNigga we can play the mule and get Pro Tools\nand show fools the A-game, set up in the crib and live\n\nWord! Man, but yo..\nI'm on that song ass first, I'm on the last verse\nFinish line 24 but I got 20 more things I gotta do\nlike, make the name up for the crew\nMight call it Witter Pop! (Naw, nigga that's wack)\nYeah you right, yo did you find a studio?\n(Yeah I came across two you know the one Ken-doo talk about?\nThe other one's called Odyssey)\nOh yeah yeah, let's take it there man\nI heard it's more private, B\n\n(\"Let me be\") At the front of this shit\n(\"It was plain to see\") We the number one pick\n(\"It's over now\") in bright lights surrounded by skirts\n(\"You had me found, you shot me down\")\nPop Life & Deen Whitter, we puttin in work!\nWork!

(YEAH!!)\nWORK WORK WORK!\nAiyyo, we spent many years\nbrushin the plaque off the teeth\nIt's time to switch gears\nand place the plaques underneath the roof\nThe gold ones\nwas platinum plus much better\nThe right contract bring the right con-CHEDDAR\nAnd we ain't cons\n\nSo just like Etta (At Last)\nWe have to blast through, anybody ask you\nWho works harder? You say First Serve\nTry to say different, say you got some nerve!\n\nSee you got some herbs that gon' hate\nThe Band-Aid is for dem boys! Nikita La Femme boys!\n\nThe key to the city is ours\nThe broads, the house, the cars\nThe sky's the limit, the stars\nShalamars in it, there it is!\n\nBut what took you so long?\nThe energy's a tall glass of milk, the secret's best kept\nin the basement, potential amazement\nUntil we hit the surface of the pavement, PEACE!\n\n(\"Let me be\") At the front of the line\n(\"It was plain to see\") Cause it's our time\n(\"It's over now\") in bright lights surrounded by skirts\n(\"You had me found, you shot me down\")\nPop Life & Deen Whitter, we puttin in work!\nWork! (Work!) Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!) Work! (Yeah!)\nWork! (Get it in!) Work! (Yeah!) Work! (Yeah!) Work! (Yeah!)\nWork! (Work!) Work (Work!) Work! (Work!) Work! (Work!)\nWork! (Work!!) Work (Work!!) Work (Work!!) Work! (Work!!)\nWORK WORK WORK!\n\nWe got the work alright\nKen-Doo put a plan together, got us organized\nStudio time, little shows here and there, AND means!\nBut, things weren't happenin overnight now..\nShit, days became weeks, weeks into months\nAnd months? Months turned into doubt\nWhat we gon' do now?\n",
