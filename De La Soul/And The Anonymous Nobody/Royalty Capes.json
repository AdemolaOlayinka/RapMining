Waterfall rythmes from crowns containing galaxies. Gems from past dimensions. A bond so strong it has unbreakable status. Spits hieroglyphic scripture like a god from Atlantis\nUs three be the omega like fish oil\nThis royal right be own no rentals\nOwners of the cape express\nHe went from the mind you ate off the plate of fundamentals\nKnocked on every door of the country's red rugs\nWe'll lay on floors\nWe walk and etched in like testament\nAnd find the atomic number 79\nOn Vernon's periodic table we dine upon\nSittin' on thrones gettin' blown to bits\nBy our royal dime, fillet of fine dinin'\nNews from the east sire\nThem east coast kings are still findin' ways to stay on\nOn for play on like a damn disease\nSpread the word of Ramseys and fry up a pan of these\nSalute down when day breaks\nAnd give me my checks with the same first name as the cape\nI repeat salute down when day breaks\nAnd give me my checks with the same first name as the capes\nWe are royalty\nWe are an army of stars unleashed\nThe sky takes notes when we speak\nOur capes move with the wind\nBecause of the wings beneath\nThis is royalty\nThe sky takes notes when we speak\nOur capes move with the wind\nBecause of the wings beneath\nThis is royalty\n",
