I couldn't be nobody but myself, you know that\nBut then they all started talking\nThey were talking about love being gone\nIn my house\nThey said that there ain't much left to love\nWell, there's always something to love if you're familiar enough to recognize it\nI mean have you cried for anything lately?\nAnd I don't mean for your friends or your bills or yourself\nI mean, for this!\nWhen do you think it's time to love something the most, child?\nWhen it's successful? And have made everything easy for us, huh?\nThat ain't the time at all It's when its reached it's lowest and you don't believe in it anymore\nAnd the world done kicked it and its tail enough that its lost itself!\nYes, that's when. When nobody cares. That's right. Nobody\n",
