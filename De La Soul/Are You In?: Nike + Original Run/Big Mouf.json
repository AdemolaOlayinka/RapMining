    "lyrics": "Some say the game's real\n'cause The Man didn't give us manuals to the game to make it big\nA corner boy tryna claim a smidge\nTo keep all the right foods in the fridge\nKeep all the right dudes on the bridge\nWhen I get in, the captian seek\nSorta liek James Kirk, but my name's Work-MATIC\nHere to adjust, the pros oppose to gettin froze than economy plus\nLink up with Erick and P.\nAnd do a whole collabo together, called +The Joint+, business class\nTo run up in first so the biz can last\nInstead, the biz went to hell and got infiltrated\nBy them mainstream infidels, so here to settle the score\nBlow up the track to bits and leave nothing!\nNo clause or claim, provoking a fear or fame\nJust know the name! It ain't De La, that's the group I'm in\nIt ain't old school, that's the truth I blend\nAnd this will not be the realest shit I ever wrote\nBut more real than theirs, so what that say about the words THEY spoke?\nI tell ya light and raw, you never find a black man with blue balls...\nLike you hard, sell a load every area code\nDomestic or inter-national, see that sounds a little un-rational\nWatch your step, you might TRIP!\n\nLook out below, a nigga done fell in\nThese rhymes are for sell, but it ain't gun sellin\nTellin tales as such, that's just for liars\nEquipped with the hands to silence ya whole choir\nDeny her! She the one who started this nonsense\nExcuse me, I got issues of my consciences\nFlip like Geminis, in fact, I am just a Virgo\nTee shot the bird to skeet skeets a burner to ya big mouf\nYou can find us in the big house, invitin you to the doorstep\nWhere the raw's kept, the fourth step, broke\nI'm a take him if I got money on his mouth so I'm a move the cliff\nThe right route, we break bread and make bread\nCharge a fam a fee for it's mistake bread\nGood times, sometimes seem corrupt\nI put my shell on the book so we movin on up\nConfuse it all up, peep the rule of thumb\nI got consent from a king so a bitch can't run\nAnd beggars can't beg when the deaf don't hear\nIf I'm blind to the facts, I see your bullshit clear\nAnd you been all year in my ear with your feathers\nPeacockin the boy, we droppin the boy\nInserts volumes, twenty are dances\nIt'll be sweet if you heard the advance...\nNow bring the chorus in\n\nSHOUT! Talk about it! Say somethin!\n(That's that SHIT right there!)\nYou heard that? LOUDER! It's the BIG MOUF!\n\nThe mirror shows me frowns when the money's tight\nSometime you gotta go LEFT to get the money right\nAnd I'm NOT gonna be left behind\nFuck all your phonecalls, Merce has left the line\nWhatever you need say, say it to Trent or Ray or Chris Ak, or Smilez\nNo longer wanna hear it, unless it's the files of the MP3\nGottin me to spit the P, with about five-letter Fs' attached\nWhile you in your ride screamin'...\n(YO, what the hell did he say?!) (Man, bring that back!)\nA poor man's hope, a poor manhood\nBack in your egghead like yo...\nYou niggas will NOT elude me!\nHelpin you remember wire the first, you should include me\nThe Leo slash dragon, who pulled out the knife\nAnd SLASHED all four tires on the bandwagon!\n",
