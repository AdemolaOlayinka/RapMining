Peep out the transition\nThe ammunition that we shootin is ambition\nAnd implanted inside every history book\nWe the crew who travel to every cranny and nook\nOf the free world, freeing girls from they mate\nFill us all with hate, I know if I answered and slide\nShe move ahead back and forth instead of, {Dave enters in} side to side\nThis be that one to ride to\n\nThe one that jump inside of and make love to your mind\nI'm like that {nigga} baby\nA Vancouver lady, Amsterdam boy\nSent to the earth to ambush at five point 1ne\nRadio decks I revamp cassettes\nIt's that digital age, ma, protect your credit card\nPlastic dope on lasso rope on\nCowboy-style like giddy-up, she get\nPerky like morning coffee\nSkin dark like coffee, {bitch} get off me\nFixed her mouth to mouth off and she lost me in that\nEve of the night, a plate of Monte Cristo, skip the disco\nWe leave in the night, rules don't apply the theives in the nights\nSteal hearts like crooked card decks, with more facts\nShow her more money on the budget, you gotta love it\nScreams take flights like spaceships at nights\nNow count it off - \"T minus...\"\nReunited after degrees on September\nThe leaves begin rushing, the earth'll felt for it\nScores of faces, so we rock the bells for it\nNow the horses shouldn'ta done me like that, I make sure we got\nGlue for the summer, make due for the summer\nNine hundred horns, we done blew a new number\nDrink with the king, I'm holdin on to 40s forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever... Forever...\nForever...
