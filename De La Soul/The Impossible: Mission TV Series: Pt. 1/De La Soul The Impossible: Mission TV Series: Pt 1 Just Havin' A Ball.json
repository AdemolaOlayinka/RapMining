I'm about to campaign\nfor that President Bush, damn I declare war\nBring on some of your friends, matter fact, the next whore\n\nAlright I'm tryin to have a ball without all that girl talk\nCause my girl wouldn't like that either\nSo I'm I'm tryin to stay away from that\nAww fuck it, I'm hot\nLet me, let me do it, let me do it a lil' bit\nAiyyo \"Gimme That,\" that Lil' Webbie & Bun B\nI used to mash Lil' Debbie up in 1-D\nThose were the days, but days don't change\nSo we still get it on just to keep it all the same and it's\nroutine to rock roll and rip shows\nAcross the zip codes and fold the thick loads\nof information inside your earlobes\nWe are the high end thread for your mere clothes\nOutside of the box is where you'll find us\nThose who find to it, step behind us\nIt's not about the lead, we not tryin to be\nthe heir to the throne but the air that you breathe and it's\nprotocol for us to get at y'all\nWith a face filled with game\nWe play without the cheat codes, we don't need those to rock\nClose the do' in our face, best believe we gon' knock\nLet us in y'all\n\nYeah that's right\nIt's De La, that's how we do\nWe just have a ball everytime we have a ball\nNow make sure y'all look out\nfor the TV series, this is part one, \"The Impossible Mission\"\nWe gon' have two and three\nAiyyo Why, part two point five, hahaha\nThat's how we do it y'all\nShout out to my man Maseo\nShout out to my man Prince Paul\nShout out to everybody out there, De La family\nYou know how we do\nJust havin a ball, I just like talkin\nI don't really talk too much, I'm just havin a ball\nYeah\nShout out to A Tribe Called Quest, you know how we do it\nYeah\nShout out to cuttin the record off!\n",
