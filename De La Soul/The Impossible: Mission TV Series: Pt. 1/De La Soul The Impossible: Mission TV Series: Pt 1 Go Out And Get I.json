    "lyrics": "I mean the only way that you gon' get it\nis to go out there and get it, y'knahmsayin?\nIt's like sometimes you gotta just put it all and bet the farm\nYou ain't gonna get it any other way, you know?\nFor me it's about bein better than I was yesterday, y'know\nI'm sick and tired of bein sick and tired, I'm tired of losin\nSo I'ma bet it all, y'knahmsayin?\n\nAll hail to the check one-two\nYou can catch one-two at a theatre near\nWhere you'll find me supportin rap, like a brassiere\nNot sayin if the game is tits, but you gotta admit\nthat the soul be the, holder of the mic device\nRhymes filled with blood and guts, the game filled with\nbolts and nuts, but them shits rusty\nAnd the trusty MC got the W-4\nYou can find me up in the W. Moore\nI'm back on the juice with them heavy-o Chevy rhymes\nMissin like crime on the deuce\nWe don't sit in boats and fish, we sit in studios\nand quote words to serve on a dish\nAnd the nerve that you wish you had I got bags of\nAnd tracks are drugs that only make it worse when you're high\nListenin to the Why on the first verse named Wonder\nSo don't underestimate, what we create\nAnd you'll never find us pullin up to clubs\nin them long stretch whales\nOr pushin inside girls with Donkey Kong stretch tails\nAnd when all else fails, we hit 'em with the charm\nthat reflects like muscles on the arm\nAnd even if crowded like food courts\nWe own home court advantage so we never feel alarmed\n\nIt's eighty-six y'all, put your rap on pause\nMore milk on the mic than them pregnant broads\nNine times out the dime it's a penny on the floor\nSame penny you walk around and ignore\nSee I'm the penny that'll have the deal closed\nTurn that point nine nine into one point oh's\nA millisecond you'll be needin in the race\nThat photo finish I ain't even see your face\nI'm that one degree that made the Pisa lean\nThe one goal, one job, one aim and one team\nThat one good push that gave birth to your dream\nThat one good year, that one good beer\nSee you can hit the lotto with hope and a buck\nBut with 99 cents yo' ass is outta luck\nOnce upon a time, it's not once it ain't happen\nOne pop in the air does not mean you clappin\nOne rap hit does not mean you be rappin\nAlthough you bust rhymes, you ain't kill it ONE TIME!\nNever was to be in the first, just the second one\nIf you don't find me with mic, I'm mic checkin one\nOne good pinch, and one good hunch\nThat's just one bad apple out the New York bunch\nGot ones, but I want 2's 3's and 4's\nI'm that one when you got one more\n",
