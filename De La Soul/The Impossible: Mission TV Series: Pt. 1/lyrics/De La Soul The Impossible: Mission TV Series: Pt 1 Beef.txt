Nah that's not what I mean
I mean, every mornin I wake up and I give thanks
Y'know, that I get dressed up and rob banks
I don't need a mask, I ain't askin for favors
Everybody got it rough
If you were the only one who had it bad
then there would be a cause for effect, you hear me?
It's easy to live after the world's opinion
It's easy to live accordin to your own
And when she don't got love for you, man
She's like a loaf of bread with nuttin to drink
Goin down hard, that's word up
She'll tear anything up for you
Shit is rough but it's fair man, ain't a joke out here
Niggaz been doin good for a long time
but now the game has changed, y'knahmsayin?
We just came home, now we got BEEF!
