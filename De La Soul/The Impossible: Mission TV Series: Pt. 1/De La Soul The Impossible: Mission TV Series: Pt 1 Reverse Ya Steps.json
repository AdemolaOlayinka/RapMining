    "lyrics": "Who floats like a butterfly, sting like a bee\nNot me! Leave that for that boxing great\nYet I float like b-balls on a path to swish\nSting like making shots when you're pissed\nOf course that's sayin you're on court to playin a round\nUnprotected blues and I'm the same bad news\nYou come pokin your face in my place\nThe rest you best believe you're gonna lose\nI'll choose every line to floor ya\nI'm a New York nigga, my momma and them from Waynesboro, Georgia\nWonder Why, I cop weed just to feed\nto my ex-pectations to keep them high\nCause my own try to hold me back, with that black on black rhyme\nGet off me blackie! Your whole style tacky\nand lack the approach of men\nYou just a kitten in a lion's den, alright reverse it, aiyyo\n\n\nBack up lil' nigga, reverse your steps\nBack up lil' nigga, reverse your steps\nBack up lil' nigga, reverse your steps\nReverse your steps, reverse your steps\n.. Reverse your steps\nBack up lil' nigga, reverse your steps\nBack up lil' nigga, reverse your steps\nBack up lil' nigga (reverse your steps - REVERSED)\n\n\n\n\nI box better when I'm on these ropes\nAnd got bloody in the eighth but your apes couldn't save you\nThe left got brutal and ripped shack your ribs back\nSo now you sprayin the streets without eatin\nMy plate's got broccoli and snow peas on it\nSee we healthy like Lance Armstrong and then Popeye\nSmall fry fuckin with these Spuds McKenzies\nGet the bucks, get the money, and the bid or your Benji's\nRadar heavy I analyze the blips\nSee me comin in your land I'ma AND-1 this bitch\nAin't nuttin to lose but these two fronts, a few stunts\nThe Chuckers got strings on 'em, we airborne\nCleared for takeoff, face off the square puzzle\ngot you puzzled like yo is it peace or piece?\nIncrease the blows for the stutter step to it\nMake you jump back and kiss your death and step back!\n",
