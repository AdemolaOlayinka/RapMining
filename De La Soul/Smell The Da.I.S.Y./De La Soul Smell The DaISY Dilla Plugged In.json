Coming up..\") {\"Get down!\" - }\n\nAiyyo, answering any alter service\nPerogative praised positively I'm acquitted\nEnemies publicly shame my utility\nBut after the battle they're admitting I'm with it\nSimply soothe will move, vinyl like groove\nTransistors are never more shown with like\nWhen vocal flow brings it all down in ruins\nDesigned with the sounds of Dilla, we call it Plug Tunin'\n\n(\"Are we on the air?\") We in the D tonight, y'all\n(\"Are we on the air?\") We live with Dilla tonight\n(\"Are we on the air?\") Yo, shout out to Ma Dukes (\"Hello, Ma!\")\n\nAiyyo, gaze at the sight of a method\nDive beneath the depth of a neverending verse\nGasping and swallowing every last letter\nVocalised liquid holds the quench of your thirst\nReasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown\nDifferent individuals are dazzled by the showbiz\nAuditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather\nHold a count at three.. and in the end leave it as it is\nFlow to the sway of my do-re, mi\nLeaving are fixed lunatics who will hawk\nWords are sent to the vents of all humans\nThen converted to a phrase called talk\nMusical notes will send a new motto\nEvery last poem is recited at noon {\"Get down!\" - }\nFocus is set, let your Polaroids click\nAs they capture the essence of Dilla with this Plug Tunin'\n\n(\"Are we on the air?\") We in the D tonight, y'all\n(\"Are we on the air?\") We live with Dilla tonight\n(\"Are we on the air?\") Yo, show love, it's Ma Dukes (\"Hello, Ma!\")\n\nFlowing in file with a new style\nBarrels are cleaned and loaded for salute\nChanters with the choice standing steady like my mouthpiece\nParagraph preacher, now introduced\nDrums are heard sounding off on each and every person\nVocal confetti is blown at top stage\nRoses and violets aren't proper for throwing\nwhen showing appreciation, why? This is a DA.I.S.Y.
