I don't cast a glow\nYes, I guess it's reflex, some have no control\nI'd rather let a laughte, tally off I go\nCanoeing in the river or out into the O\nYou just know me not, so not play the role\nSome are lovey-Dovey, ah you crazy crow\nSome shake your hand but this is called the Show\nI was John Doe, now I'm Mr. Joliceau\nPissed with the witness, and now I adore\nO's got the world cause O's was on tour\nGirls gave the O's and oh my niggaz, for sure\nWhere they arose, well nobody knows\nAnd what do they mean, I mean this how it goes\nOh shoot's got the O's, when you hold the dough\nYou know who you are but they didn't know\nAnd now with respect they flex like a pro\nYou're first another nigga but NOOOOOOW....\n\nOodles of oodles of O's, y'know\nWe go oodles of oodles of O's, y'know\nWe go oodles of oodles of O's, y'know\nWe go oodles of oodles of O's, y'know - SHUT UP!!\n\nLast of the fast Plug pipers at yo' do'\nIn ya eye, burning like rubbin alcoho'\nNative is the Tongue that speaks the Guacomo\nKinfolk will play this in stere-ere-o\nChanters play the part of a herd of a show\nPos prints the peace on his jeans of Girbauds\nBut let the herd know, beef they wanna throw\nLunches of punches, is what we'll bestow\nOodles of O's enhance my \"ho's\" and mic checks\nO's take the shape of medallions and specs\nDon't forget the O's that let the air in my nose\nBreathe in the fresh, stale hit the roads\nGirls ask for flicks and unblock the po'\nEat the Al Greens...
