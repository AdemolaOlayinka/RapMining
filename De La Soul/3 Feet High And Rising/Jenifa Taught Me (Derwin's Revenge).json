(OH!)\n\nBreakfast, broke it fast\nShe was in my English class\nAsked for notes, rocked my boat\nJenifa... (OH!)\n\nJenny\nLost her favourite penny\nSo I gave her a dollar\nShe kissed me\n(And I hollered)\n\nIn a flash the school bell rang\nJenny grabbed on to my hand\nTook me home and said, Trugoy just\nSwing and swing and swing\n\n\nThe downstairs, where we met\nI brought records, she cassettes\nLost the breaks, found her shape\nJenifa, oh Jenny\n\nTranscripts showed more than flirt\n'I love daisies' read her shirt\nGrabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed\nJenifa, oh Jenny\n\nMarvelous\nShaped like a vase\nNo one can live their life for Pos\nFound a house, aroused my joust\nJenifa, oh Jenny\n\nHer clothes, I did shuck\nJust like Dan I strictly stuck\nTo the punt, she cried 'kick it'\nPosdnuos was in\n\nJenny\nOnly thought about Jimmy\nBut asked was I a virgin\nLike some kid named Derwin?\n\nShe said 'Let's try it in the bathroom'\nBut 'Dnuos is way above sinks\nSo to the kitchen she did Dan\nAnd came back wrapped in Saran\n\n(Now wait a minute! Little Derwin got something to\nshow us that Jenny could never do. Listen...)\n\n(Hey. Look at little Derwin. Look at him go, look at him go!\nAwww, baby.)\n\n\nPositions, muscles flexed\nDove was lost in a Ghana hex\nPassed her test, felt her teddy\nJenifa oh Jenny\n\nNotions\nSoothed the mood\nDove was lost in De La heaven\nScrewed Plug Two, did the do\nJenifa oh Jenny\n\nJenny\nTeased my homeboy Granny\nIn fact she teased so many\nShe was known as a garden tool\n\n\nNo more\nI dispatched\nWas it Jimmy had met his match\nOr could it be the realisation\nAll girls owned a Jenny\n\nFor normal health\nI had fought\nA valuable lesson she had taught\nDon't flaunt that the candy is good\nUnless you came with plenty\n",
