Easy, the one who needs\nAttention in the largest span and loves to lead\nAlways found at the jams, but never dance\nJust provoke violence due to one glance\nThe future plays no matter, just the present flow\nWhen the greeting place is the G-H-E-T-T-O\n\n\nLies are pointed strong into your skull\nDeep within your brain against the wall\nTo hide or just erase the glowing note\nOf how to use the ghetto as a scapegoat\nTruth from Trugoy's mouth is here to scar\nThose who blame the G for all bizarre\nSo open up your vents and record well\nFor this is where we stand, for the True tell\nGhetto gained a ghetto name from ghetto ways\nNow there could be some ghetto gangs and ghetto play\nIf ghetto thang can have its way in ghetto range\nThen there must be some ghetto love and ghetto change\nThough confident they keep it kept, we know for fact\nThey lie like ghettos form, 'cause people lack\nTo see that they must all get out the ghetto hold\nThe truth they never told\n'Cause it's just the ghetto thang\n\nIT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)\n\n\nDo people really wish when they blow\nOut the cake candles, and if so\nIs it for the sunken truth which could arise\nFrom out the characters in which the ghetto hides\nRoses in the ring supply their shown relief\nGranted it's planted by their shown belief\nKill and feed off your own brother man\nHas quickly been adopted as the master plan\nPosses of our people has yet to provoke\nFreedom or death to them, it's just a joke\nWhat causes this defect, I don't know\nMaybe it's the G-H-E-T-T-O\n\nIT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)\n\nStanding in the rain is nothing felt\nWhen problems hold more value, but never dealt with\nBuildings crumbling to the ground\nImpact noise is silent sound\nBut who's the one to say this life is wrong\nWhen ghetto life is chosen strong\nWe seem to be misled about our dreams\nBut dreams ain't what it seem\nWhen it's just the ghetto thang\n\nIT'S JUST THE GHETTO THANG (WORD)\n",
