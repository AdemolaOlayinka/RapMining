De La Soul
3 Feet High And Rising
1989)
I am Trugoy 
A Dove-like boy 
Could wingspread, 
But instead, 
I will employ 


Me the Plug Three 
Or Baby Huey 
I eat up 
All ketchup 
For its tendency 


I am Plug One 
I'm 19 years young 
I love peace 
Well at least 
I think we need some 


I'm Q-Tip y'all 
3 Feet produced by Prince Paul 
This session 
Was lessoned 
By one Qualiall 


I am Granny 
Thank discoriety 
The 3, 4 
Yo, no more 
I need peace for me 


I'm China 
I'm Jette 
The Cue Cards we inject 
We're crazy for Daisies 
When we're on the set 


Will rise, not fall 
Definition, Prince Paul 
The Mentor 
Don't be sore 
When I say 
That's all
