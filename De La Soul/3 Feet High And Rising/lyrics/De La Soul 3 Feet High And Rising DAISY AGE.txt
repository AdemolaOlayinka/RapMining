1989)
(Woah. Stay, stay, stay) 
(Daisy! Daisy!) 
(I love daisies, I love daisies, 
I love pushing up your favourite daisies) 
(Daisy!) 
(This is Posdnuos, the president of a paragraph) 

Paragraph 
President 
President preaching 'bout the on-tech, 
Known for the new step, 
Stop and take a bow 
Amityville 
Resident 
Resident supported by the speaker view 
Want to feel it in your shoe 
Let me show you how 
Platform 
Witnesses 
Witnesses, show you to my show-lab 
Fill you with my vocab 
Hope you have a spoon 
Discuss 
Contracts 
You like the way I vocalise 
And bring it to a compromise 
My P.A. won't set up till noon 
It's a DAISY age 
Sun 
Ceiling 
Ceiling connects to the sun 
Burning inside everyone 
On a side, plug-a-fied sire 
One 
Million 
Demonstrations have been heard 
My hair burns when I'm referred 
Kid shouts my roof is on fire 
Go 
Dancing 
Dancing like a bandit 
Psychics try to stand it 
Keep it up until they burn a cell 
Romancing 
Romancing dialect in shows 
Posdnuos creating flow 
You say you didn't know 
Oh well, it's a DAISY age 

Pedal 
Promenade 
Promenade people to the providence 
Dove will show dominance 
Inside of every phrase 
Rebel 
Renegade 
Renegade reaching only topflight 
Can't find your new height 
Think you need a raise 
Dialect 
Ultimate 
Ultimate strings from the soul stuff 
Copies always staying rough 
Before they go to plate 
Try a pack 
It'll stick 
Stick to you but won't deflate 
Keeping all the levels straight 
I tell you, mate, that we're top rate 
'Cause it's a DAISY age 
The speak 
Motor 
Motor is the heart beat 
Sleeping in your car seat 
Kept alive to every mile discovered 
Complete 
Quota 
Quota sharp at 12 noon 
Risen to a new tune 
Positive is greater than negative 
Image 
Mirror 
Mirror image don't contend 
Vocals should be comprehended 
Silver audience'll say what's said 
Scrimmage 
Nearer 
Nearer to the goal line 
Forget about the rose vine 
The Soul will let you know it's time 
And it's a DAISY age 
(La la la la, lah) 
(This is a DAISY age) 
(Sing about, sing about the DAISY age) 
(Let it rain, let it rain, rain on a DAISY) 
(Rain on, rain on) 
  
 Now it's the end of the show. Contestants, do you have any answers? 
 (Clueless babble, including 'Nah,' 'I dunno,' 'Mama') 
 For those of you who think your answers are correct, 
Don, tell them where to send the answers to. 
 Thanks, Al. For all you listeners at home who think you 
have the right answers, jot 'em down on a four by ten sheet of paper, 
and get two proof of purchases from the back of the album, and send 
them to Tommy Boy records in care of Dante the Scrubb, 1747 First 
Avenue, New York, New York, 10128. For those who have all four 
answers correct, you will receive a specially selected grand prize. 
Thanks and goodnight, for Three Feet High and Rising, this is Don 
Newkirk.
