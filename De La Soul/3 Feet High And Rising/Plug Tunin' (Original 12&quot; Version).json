This is a Daisy Age\nHands won't sweat 'cause there's no threat\nMic will stay dry while pitchin' so loose\nRhymes aren't fables but stable to be on time\n'Cause they're marketed and labeled sticker 'Posdnuos'\nThis pitch will fit with every consumer\nMicrophone loosed in cycles, start blooming\nProfit and cost should never be lost\nAll due to a clue of a naughty noise called\nPlug Tunin'\n(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)\n(Mmm-hmm, yeah)\nPlug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two\nPlug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two\n\nDazed at the sight of a method\nDying at the death of a neverending verse\nGasping and swallowing every last letter\nVocalised liquid holds the quench of your thirst\nReasons for the rhythm is for causes unknown\nDifferent individuals are dazzled with the showbiz\nAuditions are gathered but the Soul would just rather\nHold a count at three and in the end leave it as it is\nFlow to the sway of my do-re-mi\nLeaving are fixed lunatics who will hawk\nWords are sent to the vents of humans\nThen converted to a phrase called talk\nMusical notes will send a new motto\nEvery last poem is recited at noon\nFocus is set, let your polaroids click\nAs they capture the essence of a naughty noise called\nPlug Tunin'\n(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)\n(Mmm-hmm, yeah)\nVocal in doubt is an uplift\nAnd real is the answer that I answer with\nDying yet live, what you must realise\nThat the tune that I present is surely not a gift\nDifferent in style is definite\nAnd style which I flaunt is sure legit\nNow set aside, I say I hold pride\nIn performing this melodic misfit\nSo swing 'cause this pitcher is pitching\nIn sense JD Dove is now saying\nAll sing along to his favorite song\nWhile the pocket transistors are playing\nBut least but not last I'm frightened\nFor the words that I reply hold doom\nLife of the check can be stopped by accident\nWhen you're tripping the wire of the Plug Tune\n(Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmm)\n(Mmm-hmm, yeah)\n(No-one that I know can live my life for me)\n(Are you ready for this?)\n",
