No, not again!)\n(Get the daisies for the...)\nPotholes in my lawn\n\nEverybody's sayin'\nWhat to do when suckin' lunatics start diggin' and chewin'\nThey don't know that the Soul don't go for that\nPotholes in my lawn\nAnd that goes for my rhyme sheet\nWhich I concentrated so hard on, see\nI don't ask for maximum security\nBut my dwellin' is swellin'\nIt nipped my bud when I happened to fall\nInto a spot\nWhere no ink or an ink-blot\nWas on a scroll\nI just wrote me a new 'mot'\nBut now it's gone\nThere's no\nSuckers knew that I hate\nTo recognise that every time I'm writin'\nIt's gone\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a)\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee)\nPotholes in my lawn\n\nI've found that it's not wise\nTo leave my garden untended\n'Cause eyes have now pardoned all laws of privacy\nEven paws are after my writer\nSee, I've found that everyone's sayin'\nWhat to do when suckers are preyin'\nOn my well-guarded spreadsheets\nOh why, hell does it send up fleets\nOf evil-doers through the big hole\nTo get to evil-doers who dig holes\nWhich leaves my lawn with lawn-chew\nI think I'd better plant traces to give clues\nOr better yet call 911\nAnd when they get here I inform them I'm the Plug One\nOpen a chair and let them realize the reason\nFor concern of the Soul,\n'Cause we've come down with a case of potholes\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a)\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee)\nPotholes in my lawn\n(Who stole, who stole, who stole the cookie\nfrom the cookie jar?)\n\nNow you got the message\nWhat to do when you die\nThe death that I predict in 'Plug Tunin'\nIt's a shame that you deny to claim\nThat you stole my words of fame\nThat I wrote in my rhyme sheet\nWhich I concentrated so hard on, see\nI don't ask for a barbed wire fence, B\nBut my dwellin' is swellin'\nIt nipped my bud when I happened to fall\nInto a spot\nWhere no ink or an ink-blot\nWas on a scroll\nI just wrote me a new 'mot'\nBut now it's gone there's no\nSuckers knew that I hate\nTo recoginse that every time I'm writin'\nIt's gone\nPotholes in my lawn\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-a)\n(Yodel-a-hee, Yodel-oh-hee, Yodel-ee-hee-hee-hee)\n",
