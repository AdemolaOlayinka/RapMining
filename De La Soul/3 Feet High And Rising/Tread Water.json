    "lyrics": "I was walking on the water when I saw a crocodile\nHe had daisies in his hat, so I stopped him for a while\nHe delivered me a message, a massage to soothe my stage\nWhat it was was more then plug-up dosage\nMore than DAISY age\nConversation drew a rule,\nWhich the crowd will roar by millions\nMr. Crocodile said, 'Dove, you must look\nFor now the villains try to hold you underwater\nBut one thing we all must heed\nSony Walkmans keep us walking\nDe La Soul can help you breathe when you tread water'\n\nAs I walked along my journey,\nI thought 'What have I just learned?'\nIn a flash I saw commotion\nThere was movement in these ferns\nSilently the silence came, was it the end of my world?\nI shouted out in fear, 'Who's there?'\n'It's me,' said Mr. Squirrel\n'I've searched for you all over, now you're found,\nNo time to waste. We must find the Preacher Man,\nWe must find the P.A. Mase. All my population's dying,\nAnd we're all in tune to doom.\nLike the Daisy, I need water\nI need chesnuts to consume.'\n'Mr. Squirrel,' I said, 'I'm sorry,\nBut the problem can't be solved\nIf there's no one here to help, and no one to get involved\nAlways look to the positive and never drop your head\nFor the water will engulf us if we do not dare to tread\nSo let's tread water'\n\n\nNow one weary day I woke, my alarm said 'Plug time's up'\nFilled my bath up with the water, gargled with my gargle cup\nAs I bathed I felt a presence, and I'm sort of ticklish\nI looked down and then around and I heard,\n'Hi! I'm Mr Fish. How do you do? As for me,\nI'm in tip-top shape today, cause my water's clean\nAnd no-one's menu says Fresh Fish Filet\nSee I look past all my worries, which is something you must do\nThough you're fed up, throw your head up\nWith this advice ffrom me to you\nAnd that's to tread water'\n\nAs my day went unexplained, time was finding nothing fun\nAs I walked along the sidewalk, I heard,\n'Psst, excuse me, Plug One.'\nFrom my Soul, De La that is, I hollered\n'Yes, are you talking to me?'\n'No alarm meant,' he said, 'Let me introduce myself.\nI'm Mr Monkey.'\n'Mr Monkey, I pledge you slap of five,\nNow how does your problem meet?'\nHe said, 'My bananas are at their ripest, but they all\nStand at three feet. My swinging hand is bandaged up.\nCould you help me with this chore?'\nI brought him down to the Native shop\nAnd bought him copies of the De La score\nWhich assisted well in his elevation\nNow all bananas is at his grasp\nHe decided with this accomplished,\nHe would put me on to the path\nHe to my to live by the Inner Sound, y'all\nWhich would bring me health in showbiz\nThen to use them, not abuse them\nAnd then in the words that got me to 'em\nAnd that is to tread water\n",
