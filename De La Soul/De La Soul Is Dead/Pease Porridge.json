Yo, De La? Yo, those punk kids, man?\n- They ain't punks, man.\n- Yo man, those kids are wack man, straight up booty, wack.\n- Yo, but, yo, that \"Buddy\", that was kind of fly, man, and \"Potholes?\" Slammin'. Slammin'.\n- Yeah, it was. Word up, yo it was, but forget that man, after they came out with \"Plug One, Plug Two\" then \"Potholes\", yo,\nthen they fell of with the brothers, yes they did man, yo, they were straight up pop, man, I'm telling you, forget them faggots.\n- Yo check it out, though, WRMS is throwin' a party at the club, though, man, yo I bet you they'll be there!\n- Yeah! All right, so let the brothers show up, man, let them brothers show up and get cold jacked when the leaders run up on them!\n\n(Pease porridge in the pot)\n(Pease porridge in the pot)\n(Pease porridge in the pot)\n(Nine days old)\n\n\nMy name, my name, my name is the Pasta\nNow I like, I like I like to plug the real thing\nSo loose, so loose, so loose with the tap dance,\nThe funk, the funk, funky funky stuff I bring\nMy tribe, my tribe, my tribe is known as Native Tongues,\nConsists, consists, consists of Jungle, Quest and others\nGet played, get played, played a lot on radio\nAnd also, and also, and also by some foul brothers\nThe Pease, the Pease the Pease Porridge never failed\nIt kept, it kept us calm, our stylin' merry\nBut late, but lately loonies acting real bold\nCan't sip in luxury my apple cranberry\nGirls watch, and watch, and watch I dance the big tut\nOur home, our home our homeboys has to plan tricks\nDon't real, don't real, don't realise the Native Tongue\nIs rollin' strong and we're startin' in the megamix\n\n\n- Yo, Miss Thing!\n- Yo Merisa, what's up?\n- You heard what happened at the Donut Hill the other night? - Yo I was there and those De La kids was fighting, yo they was wildin'.\n- Word man?\n- Word, the whole thing happened in front of my face, yo, they was on the dance floor, right, some kid stepped up to\nthem and said something about hippies, then punks, and the chubby one, Plug Three?\n- Yeah. Plug Three, yeah I know him.\n- All right, Plug Three, all right, he walked up to this kid, hit him real quick, think he didn't when he did, and then them\nother kids the Jungle Brothers and Quest and, um, what's the other ones, the other ones?\n- The Violators.\n- The Violators, right, right, throwing chairs, and they didn't care who they was hitting, you think they wasn't?\n- Yeah. I know, I thought it was supposed to be about peace signs, things like that, you know...\n\n\nQuestion, and that's if only I can ask this question\nCan I? (Yes you can!)\nWhy do people think just because we speak peace\nWe can't blow no joints?\n(I-I-I don't know)\n\n\nMase, this is the ninth day I've reheated this porridge. You know it keeps me peacefully, no?\n\n\nYeah, but my tolerance level has now peaked\nAnd now it's time for some heads to get flown\n\n\nWe bring, we bring, we bring, we bring the peace of course\nBut pack a nine inside, inside my De La drawers\nA picture, picture, picture, picture painted pink\nCould turn to red, to red, to red in blooded quick\nBut in a single file my Native Tongue is calm\nI rather, rather pass a brother palm to palm\nI kick, I kick, I kick a verse of unity\nAnd shack, and shackle steps to the beat, beat\nI click, I click the TV to the Simpsons\nAnd sip the Porridge deep into my system\nSo mel, so mellow mode is my day mode\nInside the studio or on a road\nThe Swing, the Swingalow is the now step\nIt's murder if you bet 'cause you're life's jep\nTo praise, to praise the Soul is on a down drag\nIt's false, because I'll spray you with the Black Flag\n\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Nine days old)\n\n\nCan't stand, can't stand, can't stand the pop music\nBrother, brother, brothers pop a lot of pow\nDon't watch, don't watch, don't watch a lot of basketball\nDon't und, don't understand the act of being fouled\nHey D, hey D, hey DJ set the record up\nIt's time, it's time, it's time to tame the annoying pups\nThrow on the Touching Fingers serenade\nSo we can throw our lemonade\nIn their face and kick their little butts\n\n\n- And off, and Mase is the first to throw a punch and he connects lovely to the ribcage. Wouldn't you say so Squirrel?\n- Indeed, indeed, I waould say he showed a lot of formulate combination, but look at the hoodlum trying to escape.\n- Yeah, it seems that that particular hoodlum showed great form in trying to escape, but he, ah, just got his ass busted.\n\n\n(Touching fingers, touch, touch)\n(One at a time, touch together)\n\n\nPeople wanna get ragged with the reruns\nMe not, me not, me not scared to trudge a bit\nThey can't, they can't, they can't get close to none\nI tap, I tap, I tap a dance war skit\nThe por, the por, the Porridge got crazy cold\nWe won't, we won't eat until the heads are flown\nTake advantage to a cool one's peaceful ways\nBut when, but when we fly that head all the people say\n\n\nHere in Frogland, we always eat our Porridge, 'cause it keeps us frogs real peaceful like.\n\n\nIn my land, my people adore Porridge. And I don't understand why De La Soul is so violent, and we are\nso peaceful, we sit by the camp fire and listen to our rituals, and they are so violent. I don't understand,\nI don't understand.\n\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Pease porridge in the pot)\n(Nine days old)\n\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Pease porridge in the pot)\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n(Nine days old)\n\n(Pease Porridge in the pot)\n",
