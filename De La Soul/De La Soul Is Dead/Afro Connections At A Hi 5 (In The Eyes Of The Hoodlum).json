Rappin' Bullsh...\n\nConnection A, click, what?\nMy dick, chick\nI smack a fish if you thinks\nMy connection ain't thick, dick\nHeaded like a punk whip\nI travel miles with a rhythmic lip\nI rock an Afro\nIn '83, gee, yo\nAnd spray the sheen so I get a Soul Glow\nI play the corner tough\nAnd me and Mase pull puffs on a blunt\n\nGivin' high-five is what I want\nSo I puff a blunt, I don't front\nI get spliffed, get a stiff\nThen I go hump a stunt\nLike a pimp pro\n(Nah, man, a super ho)\nThat's cool 'cause I'm still an Afro bro\nYeah, I'm live for my life is hectic\nEvery hour, every minute, every second\nI keep a level head and stay down to earth\n'Cause I've been an Afro since birth\n\nYeah\nNow I hold my crotch 'cause I'm top-notch\nI run amok Sasquatch, and I like to eat live crab\nI've got five beepers, you scab\nBut you can find me directly on the Ave\n(You niggas cheat me, well who's that!)\nMy breath never smells wack\nI eat the watermelon Tic-Tac\nBefore I kiss myself I always jump back\n(Yo, gee, this track is stack)\n(And you know that)\nI do three flips\nWhen a punk flip on my duke lifts\nBut I flex more strength when I'm asleep\nOn the other side with his main tapes\nMake her dry her face, buy her gold earlocks\nBut I may, she flocks round me like a donut\nShe got sprinkles but I bite my way out\nMore brothers come about, try to scheme slick\nBut the Native Tongue's thick\nLick 'em real good, like a real hood should\nBut the fly tape let the car speakers shake\nI ran a cop down, I smile a frown with a but\nShow gold teeth, 'cause I ain't a vegetarian\nNot scared of beef, sport a feather like Chief\nGot a scribble pad, you can get these gonads\n'Cause I'm big-willed, blow off like a seal\n'Cause connection with the Afro is real\n\nI be the gift of gab, but be a bro with a diss\nBecause it's tough to bluff a cab\nNo wonder Melle Mel is 'Rrrr-RAH!'\nI play of tape of the son of La-di-da\nMy cousin Rilo sells blow, a G a day\nKeeps his kids hooray, a size nine and half\nI kicks my tricks, is to live for Island\nI mug a mug vic, but I's cool, I self\nWith the quickness I bust the true slang\nShow no pit to those who don't understand\n\nThe Maseo got tailed with the big bail\nI busted loose but now the blue goose is on my tail\nI seen the ghetto go lower than it is\n(He don't care, 'cause his nigga's selling crack to the kids)\nMy jeans are brand new, with twelve more\nIn the closet with my silk, and below\nMy 45 pack thick, draw quick\nIf a nigga starts some shibidibidit\nMy crib is uptown, downtown, L.I.\nAnd another crib in Queens\nI munch some cornbread, Boar's Head\nMy favorite porck chops and\nA plate of collar greens\nI chill with Shymel, Akeem, Jaheed\nAnd the Rastafarians'll be the crown in\nAnd the Poppa\nBut the connections are still a high-five\n(Let's get busy)\n",
