Are you ready, Prince Paul?\nYou're fuckin' us up, man!\nMy playin's good, man!\nFuckin' us up, man! As we begin again... rude interruption from our audience...\nHere we go.\nOh Johnny\nYou got a bullet in your forehead, boy\nDon't you understand, you dead\nBuried six feet under the concrete\nOoh-aww-oh\nThat's the noise he made when he got shot\nBut Johnny's still dead\nStill dead\nThought about his mama\nThought about his father Josephine\nNobody could help the boy when he hit the concrete\nOoh-aww-oh\nThe last words said by Johnny\nBut now he's six feet under and he's dead\nOur next song we'll play is called Jenifa, we'll be back in a minute.\n",
