I shall not relieve, I mean reveal, my identity...\n( That's not funny.)\nSo, I think we shall begin like this. Are you ready, Prince Paul?\nYou're fuckin' us up, man!\nMy playin's good, man!\nFuckin' us up, man! As we begin again... rude interruption from our audience...\nHere we go.\nOh Johnny\nYou got a bullet in your forehead, boy\nDon't you understand, you dead\nBuried six feet under the concrete\nOoh-aww-oh\nThat's the noise he made when he got shot\nBut Johnny's still dead\nStill dead\nThought about his mama\nThought about his father Josephine\nNobody could help the boy when he hit the concrete\nOoh-aww-oh\nThe last words said by Johnny\nBut now he's six feet under and he's dead\nOur next song we'll play is called Jenifa, we'll be back in a minute.\n",
