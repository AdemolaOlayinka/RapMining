Black Sheep in the house, sweet daddy Mr. Lawnge in the\nhouse, my man the Dres in the house, you know what I'm sayin',\nHuey Love in the house, long Posdnuos, Dove, Prince Paul, the immigrant\nLucien in the house. The house Dreddy Bear, ha, Mike G!\n\nCome on everybody let's baseball\nCome on everybody do the baseball\nCome on, come on, come on, come on\nCome on everybody let's baseball\nCome on everybody let's baseball\nCome on everybody do the baseball\nEverybody, everybody, everybody, everybody\nCome on everybody let's baseball\n\nGot it goin' on. Swing it over here! Ochay, ochay, ochay.\nWe gonna swing it over here, swing it over there. We gonna do the\nbaseball. Ha ha ha!\n(Three feet)\n\nA Nubian sprocket is the one\nPlug One, cut the cap\nForward is the marcher of the chant,\nTo the clan, unless you slept\nWilly to the Wonka of the feat\nSmoke your blunt, but close your drapes\nIf we get fined by police,\nDon't worry, yo, I got the papes\nToxic is the talk that I tell,\nTell the tales from the lady who's fat\nChris made the dope beat but no Bo Peeps\n(And you can't beat that with a baseball bat)\n\n\nSwing is the is of my step\nPlug Two, groove a gut\nOn gets by when it's kept\nThree miles to my step\nForgiveness to the foes is false\nI cook goose and serve a plate\nPosition is opposed to a loss\nNo cost, no relate\nBrother got a badge of his own\nBecause the link of the life is slack\nThis licks 'em down to the Tootsie Pop\n(And you can't beat that with a baseball bat)\n\n\nMove over just a bit to the right of me\nFor I cannot see where the booty is\nI sit, I'm looking out a foggy window\nCrack it just a bit, yo this is showbiz\nIt's as though a pound goes around and around\nSo I give a pound then I do the step\nDres will be with Boca on the side\nCan I crack a smile for doz who slept\nPhonetics and kinetics perservere\nTherefore I kick it\nI took the L.I.R.R. but I did not have a ticket\nHad some Chinese food but I didn't have a spoon\nI had a dope rhyme but I didn't have it soon\nI'm looking out the window\nDay is filled with rain and gloom\nMan oh man oh man I hope I find my spoon soon\nEating large fish 'cause I know it ain't cat\n(And you can't beat that with a baseball bat)\n\n(Rrrr-RAH!)\nYo this is Plug One and I'm saying peace to Lorraine in Holland,\nthanks for not having my baby, peace.\nThis is Dres. Danica, Boston, my first tight cushion, love you.\nYo this is the Sugar Dick Daddy, I'd like to say peace\nto my father, Bombed Out Brother.\nThis is Baby Huey Plug Three, and I'd like to say peace to\nthat mother a-ahem who stole my Pathfinder in front of the studio, peace!\nYo what's up, this is Prince Paul, I'd like to say what's up\nto all the doo doo eaters and all the Kelvin Mercer look-alikes, and I'm out.\n(God damn!)\n(Have a ball!)\n",
