Padlock Jody wanna cut\nJack's thinking cap, make mine into a pack\n\"Yo, here's 20, 40, 60, pay me back\"\nConscience appears, \"Yo Jack, what you doing?\"\n\"You play the cold while honey here's cooling?\"\n\"You don't have to if you don't want to!\"\n\"You don't have to if you don't want... to!\"\nSo he begins with the ring, ring, ring,\n\"Hey Judy girl, how ya doin'\nSeen you with another man, what you doing? Screwing?\nOoh, shame on you! What, you can't wait\nFor the big bait? Well, I'mma tell you straight,\nHoney child, I'm keepin' the faith!\"\n",
