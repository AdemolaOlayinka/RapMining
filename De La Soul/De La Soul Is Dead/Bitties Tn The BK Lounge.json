Krunch\nman alright\nYo man we have any milk?\nYeah, what time is it?\nI don't know, what day is it?\nDon't know, well I'll tell you.\nWell it was a Wednesday\nme and Boss Hog was kinda hungry\nlike two eggs, and a slop beef slice of lettuce\nand a glass of milk and some cookies.\nSpotted in the mist was a BK logo\nwhat we said - well what do you know\nthis chick thought I was trying to play fly\ncause I had a pair of blue jeans on.\nYoung girl, won't you take my order?\nshe said, \"Yeah, but right now I'm kinda busy...\ncan't you see I'm trying to put this band aid on my finger?\"\nLingering, I could tell\nshe's a B-K mademoiselle\nRipped uniform and bottom bell\nand some Jelly stuff on her sleeve\nLook to this cause I had no name tag on my collar\ncould be pissed cause she's clocking 2.45 an hour\nAnd then Boss Hog hollar\n\"Girl you better make this quick!\"\nShe said, \"I ain't your girl and I ain't your chick!\"\nI had an idea and lickity split\ntook my hat off and that was it\nDread locks fallen all over me and then I said\n\"Yeah now we'll see!\"\nAnd o' with quick velocity honey was mesmerized\n\"Ain't you that guy?\"\n\"Aint you that GIRL!\"\n\"De La Soul, right?\"\n\"No Tracy Chapman!\"\n\"Why don't you come over to the counter; and write me out an\nautograph?\"\nHa ha ha, I had to laugh\nShe was quick with the Bic just to get that autograph\nBut me and Hogg just laughed, and laughed\n\"What's the name of that song you sing?\"\n\"Living in a fast car,\" I said\nForget about the order I made\nI'll go get a slice of pizza instead.\n\nBitties in the BK lounge, All they do is beg and they scrounge\nBitties in the BK lounge\n\n\n\nExcuse me, would you take my order I have to go\nShashawna's got a real job, dag don't you know!\nOh yeah, Now I recognize\nThe real real bitty with the fake fake eyes\nYo, can I interest you in some burgers and fries?\nYes you can, but you can keep your lies\ncause you know you can't diss me\nbut your pissing me off\nI know where you live and I know that your soft\nYou're as booty as they come (booty?)\nand you dress like a geek\nmy shoes cost more than you make in two weeks\nLook, you don't have to play fly in here\nI can tell your fly by the weave that you wear!\nBut you must be aware that a fly can be swatted by a BK tray\nBy the way yo, here's yours\nI know your just sweating me to kill the noise\nof your polyester pants and thier o' so high waters\nLook at what you do all day but take orders\nYou bow tie wearing, clocking and staring\nI know your just upset because you cant get the rat/wrap\nI think you Chubby for my man is living slack\nYeah, I know your man, the biggest punk in school\nselling devil rock to the fiends and the fools!\nWith one hand that punk I could snap- the kid is so skinny...\nBut we be livin fat\nSpeaking of fat, would you like a diet soda?\nCause less fat on you would spare us all the odor\nBetter yet pour it down the pants and let the acid kill\nthe smell that should have been left to Masingel!\nLet me make you a deal, take the soda free and jet\nI got to much family to heed your threats\nAre you a family man? (Word booty!)\nWell I shouldn't be surprized\nyour sister's flipping burgers and your momma's frying fries\nDon't even try that shit!\nOh damn look! (What?)\nHere comes one more\nIt's your father he just finished mooping the floor\nNow give them a hand, its the BK clan\nSo you can't talk garbage about who I am\nwell, arn't we living foul\nSpeaking of foul how bout some chicken for the cow?\nOps I meant you sorry for the mix up\nbut your stomachs always big from the sexual slip ups!\nI could buy you and sell you for pennies, young man!\n(You'd better!)\nI think theres something you should understand\nI try to be nice and help the poor make money\nAnd since I know you need it, I'll go elsewhere dummy!\nNow B-K workers is too damn rude\nI think I'll go get me some Chinese food\n",
