    "lyrics": "(Make the bass come out so clear)\n\nThis song does not contain explicit lyrics, but what it does contain\nis an udesired element. This element is known as the basehead, the\nlowest of lowest of all elements that exist. And the sad thing is,\nthis particular element... is me brudda!\nBrother, brother oh brother of mine\nWe used to be down as partners in crime\nFrom our parents our name was forged\nI was the Beaver, you Curious George\nWanted to dispose of this and that\nBut curiosity had killed the cat\nAt this age no wonder it was read\nBut this was the fate that you were fed\nThroughout high school our minds we'd waste\nHigh off all the cheeba that we could taste\nSoon you had converted to nasal sports\nEvery five minutes cocaine you'd snort\nTold me that you needed a stronger fix\nStepped to the crack scene in '86\nUnlike the other drugs where you had control\nThis substance had engulfed your body and soul\nNow from me you lost all respect\nSaid yo need to put that shit in check\nWanted me to believe that you had tried\nBut your mind and the craving had coincided\nSaid there was a voice inside you that talked\nWhich said you shouldn't stop but continue to walk\nNow the brother who could handle any drug\nHad just found the one that could pull his Plug\n\n(Ya don't stop, ya don't, ya don't stop)\n(Ya don't stop, the body rock)\n\n\"Yo, bro, got another rock for your hiking boots\"\n\"Gonna make you scream and loop three loops\"\n\"Gonna take you far on a freeway, okay\"\nRemember that day? Slipped me a smile for a 20 crack vial\nGuess what? Time to collect, correct\nDon't have a dime? It's payback time, payback time\n\"Don't cry the blues 'cause I got bad news\"\n\"Should I stab ya? Should I bite ya? Should I use my tools?\"\nNo, I got another way to earn my defeat, ah!\n(Slam the child on the hard concrete)\n(Make the bass come out so clear)\n\nBrother, brother, stupid brother of mine\nStarted getting high at the age of nine\nNow at twenty-one you're lower than low\nNowhere to turn, nowhere to go\nMy dividends and wares started to disappear\nWhere it ended up, I had an idea\nBarking you with the quickness, reversed intent\nInstead went to Pop and gave him the print\nNow Pop grew tired of being a mouse\nFinally told you to get the hell outta the house\nFrom there a mother figure came into play\nClaimed for you she saw a better day\nNow Mom was a product of Christ's rebirth\nThought the only chance was to go to church\nQuitting this stuff you had tried before\nThis time you claimed you'd really score\nSomething I had to see to believe\nPut on my suit and to church I weaved\n\nMy, my, my. What happened to the people? The people who used to care\nabout what took place in the world today? I've been summoned here\ntoday to reach the people who still can be reached, to save the people\nwho still can be saved. Can I get an Amen? Can I get an Amen?\nHit me! Forgive us. Said it's taking over. Taking over the world. All\nit's doing is taking over. Where them crackers at? Them crackers that\nthey serve, where they at?\n\nSaid evil's taking over\nSaid evil's taking over\nSaid evil's taking over, evil's taking over\nThe Lord's gonna forgive us, the Lord's gonna forgive us, Lord\nSaid the Lord's gonna forgive us\nThe Lord's gonna forgive us\n\nBullshit, didn't believe a lick\nTo this fool fell off, well that would stick\nSoon you reach your front of calm\nWalked round by rehearsing psalms\nThen you smiled with the funky frown\nWhat do you know, the voice is back in town\nMom would say it would soon go away\nYou and I knew it was here to stay\nBut the man helped you when you helped yourself\nThat meant going to rehab for your health\nFinally it went and blew your cork\nHeard you moved to the comfortable streets of New York\nAnd when my friends see me and come and ask\n\"Yo, where's your brother at?\"\nI'll be the first to splash\n\"Yo, he's a basehead\"\n(- Yo know who that was?)\n(- No.)\n(- The guy from De La Soul. Pos. Posdnuos.)\n(- Who?)\n(- You heard of De La Soul, right?)\n(- Right.)\n(- Well he was the one from De La Soul.)\n(- The one with the real nappy hair.)\n(- The one with... the dark-skinned one.)\n(- With the glasses?)\n(- Yeah.)\n(- Yeah, the ugly one!)\n(Fuck you bitch!)\n(And kept goin'...)\n",
