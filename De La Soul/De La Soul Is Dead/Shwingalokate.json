Question me instead.\nMental is the mood, whether live or dead\nLevel is the groove when I lead the led\nBut hip is my lip when I'm Shwinging it\n\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n\n\n(What's the next step?)\nIt's the fool of the clan\n(Is he down with the Shwing?)\nI am, I am\n(And by the order of Swing on hand)\nI present to you, the whole shalam\nLast was the gas, flower by the pound\nShoo, puppy tough, shoo, flower power hound\nSeason of the Shwing is sound and it's bound\n90 got the gift so lift from the ground\nSpeak me an age, age at the dough\nFeed me the donut, feed me the O\nSchool me with the new 'cause the new\nKept me fed with the brew\nI'm glued to the stew and I'm Shwinging it\n\nBreathe me the out, breathe me the in\nSend it with a skit neither friend nor begin\nLabel it a Shwing, brother come for the win\nCatch me the border, must start to begin\n90 got the knack of the Soul, grab a bit\n90 proved them wrong to those who commit\nDis to the hit list, pitched by the hit\nCaught by the herds of those in the pit\nPull me a puff of the blunt as it breeds\nThis benefit's just what you need\nJust because I'm fallin', saved by the weed\nWith dred, 'cause you know indeed I'm shwinging it\n\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n\n\nConstructed like an apple but roll like a grape\nTry with the games 'cause the fools'll take shape\nStuff to the too tough, grave is in the groove\nSop it like Sound, yo honey make a move\nShufflin' your feet, that's stiffer than a nap\nOpen up an eardrum, don't wait for the cap\nSip a third of lager, extract the waste\nTell me tell me tell me, can you get a case?\nNever oops honey, dope not a threat\nPeace be found on your color telly set\nPick up the proof for the stool pigeon sing\nShwing a load o' dat, 'cause I must put Shwing\n\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n(On and on at two steps ahead)\n(Three steps ahead)\n(Three steps ahead)\n",
