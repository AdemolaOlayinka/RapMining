De La Soul Is Dead
1991)
Aha! What a beautiful day in the concrete jungle.
I think I'll go down to Goliath and just be a fuckin' dickhead!
   
Damn, I feel good today.
I'm looking forward to going and just beating the shit out of someone and taking their money.
What a fucking great job I have!
   
I wonder why I feel so good. Could it be the music?
Could it be my breakfast? Or could it just be the fact that
I just hate everybody, dammit!
Life is grand, life is great, I'll get myself a real cheap date.
Some woman I can take to McDonalds, spend a dollar twenty-five on,
and have like, the best time of your life with afterwards.
Life is too good to believe sometimes.
But we all can't have it the way I do, so to all you suckers out there,
kiss off. All right? Bye bye!
