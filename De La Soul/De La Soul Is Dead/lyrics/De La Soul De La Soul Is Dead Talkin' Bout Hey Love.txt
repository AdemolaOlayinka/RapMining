(The radio is so clear in here.) 
(Hey) 
 
Hey Love 
Talkin' bout Hey Love 
Wanna be your push and shove 
Pop, popcorn up above 
Move me like Soul when I say 
Go to a club around the way 
And see my Hey DJ 
And make him play Hey Love 
Discover all the football teams 
Mack and eat jelly beans 
Run in the cold with no jeans 
Get yourself sick till we're seen 
Catch the flu and make tea 
How Dan Stuckie life will be 
It's all about you and me 
'Cause you're my Hey Love 
(Hey) 
Move me like Soul when I say 
Go to a club around the way 
And see my Hey DJ 
And make him play Hey Love 
(Hey) 
 Look Pos, we gotta talk. 
 Talk about what? 
 Don't play stupid with me, you know what we gotta talk about. 
 What? 
 About you becoming fully dedicated.
 So we're about to go through these line-runs again, huh? 
 You're damn right. I wanna know whatever you do for me has anything to do with love. 
 Look, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't that showing you love? 
 You see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx love, I wanna be your Hey Love. 
 You wanna be my what? 
 I said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood being one of the many girls on your 
list, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love. 
 Look, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose. 
 Yeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named Selina from uptown like a Daisy. You even 
gave her some of your special donuts for free. 
 So this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts. 
 No, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love
