I wanna know whatever you do for me has anything to do with love.\nLook, I come all the way from L.I. to the Bronx to see you, isn't that showing you love?\nYou see that's just it Pos, I don't wanna be just your Bronx love, I wanna be your Hey Love.\nYou wanna be my what?\nI said I wanna be your Hey Love. I mean it's just not the mood being one of the many girls on your\nlist, and you wouldn't be dissing me like this if I was your Hey Love.\nLook, I do everything I can to treat you like a rose.\nYeah but you even give better treatment to that girl named Selina from uptown like a Daisy. You even\ngave her some of your special donuts for free.\nSo this is what this is all about, huh? Donuts.\nNo, Pos, can't you hear the music, it's all about Hey Love\n",
