Thank you.\"\n\n\nHey how ya doin'\nSorry ya can't get through\nWhy don't you leave your name\nAnd your number\nAnd I'll get back to you\nHey how are ya doin'\nSorry ya can't get through\nBut leave your name (uh)\nAnd your number\nAnd I'll get back to you.\n\nOnce again it's another rap bandit\nFiending at I and I can't stand it\nWanna be down with the Day-Glo\nKnocking on my door, saying, \"a yo yo\"\nKnocking on my door, saying, \"a yo yo\"\n\"I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo\"\nI can't understand what the problem is\nI find it hard enough dealing with my own biz\nHow'd they get my name and number\nThen I stop to think and wonder\nBout a plan, yo man, I gotta step out town\nYou wanna call me up? Take my number down\nIt's 222-2222\nI got an answering machine that can talk to you\nIt goes\n\n\nHey how ya doin'\nSorry ya can't get through\nBut leave your name and your number\nAnd I'll get back to you\n\nYo, check it, exit the old style\nEnters the new\nBut nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew\nOr should I say flock cause around every block\nThere's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm\nNow I'm with helping those who want to help themselves\nAnd flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope\nBut it's not the mood to hear\nThe tales of limousines and pails\nOf money they'll make like a pro\nI be like, \"Yo black, just play me the tape\"\nBut at the show the time to spare I just make\nBut the songs created in they shacks\nAre so wick-wick-wack, situations like this\nAnd now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask,\n\"Was it def?\"\nAnd with the straighest face I be like, \"Hell yes.\"\nI slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul\nSo I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call\nThey get\n\n\nHey how ya doing\nSorry ya can't get through\nWhy don't you leave your name\nAnd your number\nAnd I'll get back to you\nHey how are ya doin\nSorry you can't get through\nWhy don't you leave your name and your number\nAnd I'll get back to you\nCheck it out\n\nParty at the dug-out on Diction Ave\nHaven't been to the jam in quite a while\nFigure I'll catch up on the latest styles\n'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes bi-da miles\nAll I wanna do is cut on the decks wild\nBut edition up here bi-da miles to the center\nReliever of duty, Plug One mosies in\nAnd I be like, \"Yo G, Pos does all the producing\"\n\n\nNow woe is me to the third degree\nMase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny\nJettin'\nBut I'm getting used to this demo abuse\nGetting raped and giving birth to a tape\nCause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker\nAttached to my success, sent like a stalker\nMake way to my radius playin fly guy\nTry to get on my back they force like Luke Sky\nMe Myself and I go through this act daily\nAnd rarely do I not\nNo matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me\nNo matter what the plot\nAnd even out on tour they be like,\n\"Yo I got a tape to play you back at the hotel\"\nI be like \"Oh swell\"\nUnveil the numeric code to dial my room\nAnd tell them to call me at noon\nBut of course there's no answering machine in my room\nBut a pretty young adorer\nWho I swung on tour\nAnd if it rings while we're alone\nShe'll answer the phone\nAnd with the quickness she'll recite like a poem\n\n\n\"Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring\nNow you're waiting on the beep.\nSay, I would love if you'd sing\nThe tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak.\"\nSo no problemo, just play the demo\nAnd at the end it's break out time\nPlease oh please don't press rewind\nCause I'll just lay it down the line\n\nHey how ya doing\nSorry ya can't get through\nWhy don't you leave your name and your number\nAnd I'll get back to you\n\n\nHey how ya doing\nSorry ya can't get through\nWhy don't you leave your name and your number\nAnd we'll get back to you.. peace\n\n'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank\nPosse, man, you know man, so you know you can just hook\nme up, True. You know we got this fly new jam called 'Swimming In the\nFish Tank', you know we gonna rock it man, you know\nwhat I'm saying, but I just need your help, Prince Paul gave me your\nnumber, you know man, you just gotta do that for me,\ngot this fly bassline, got these fly trombones in it man, so just hook\nme up, man, just look out, all right, call me back\nat 557-2223 all right man, just look out, all right, look out for a\nbrother man!'\n",
