Smith said to hold on\nMy brother Luck said to hold on\nMy nigga Dave said to hold on\nMy nigga Mase said to hold on\nYo, Maseo, we need to hold on\nEh, yo, y'all we need to hold on\n\nPeople are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nWell, what you wanna be?\nWe wanna be ready!\nDo you wanna lose hate for love?\nYes!\nDo you wanna see these gates above?\nYes!\nI said people are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nBut are you willing to try?\nWe wanna try harder!\nDo you really wanna carry some weight?\nYes!\nAre you ready to design your fate?\nYes!\nYo, people are you ready?\nYes we're ready!\nWell what you wanna be?\nWe wanna be ready!..\n\nOperation complete. Preparing for.. Installment three\n",
