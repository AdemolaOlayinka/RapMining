Nimble\nBut it's time to make that foggy vision crystal\nWe gots to get the crystal right?\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nAll I wanna do is take my time..\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nAll I wanna do is take my time..\n\nTake my time..\nWell I don't wanna go that far\nTo sell my soul, I ain't gonna go that far\nI'm takin minds and hearts beyond the shinin star\nRaw dick, honey I don't wanna go that far\nSo listen why you riskin your mentality against mine?\nSick of leadin love\nSick of leadin love, leavin love loudfaced\nin the vehicle of mine\nThem wanna do awards, nine ninety-nine, watch em\nProfile the true fall out for so-called friends\nLike mercury and water, we just don't blend\nI end the game technically, you wanna stop me\nTrue gems show affection like Jody Watley, so..\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nAll I wanna do is take my time..\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nAll I wanna do is take my..\nTake my.. take my time..\nTake my..\nTake my.. take my time..\nTake my.. (but I don't wanna go that far!)\n\nI recall kissin on my lady, talkin bout makin babies\nNow we made the baby, but cannot connect as legal spouses\nNow me and my daughter reside in different houses\nWhat louses up the structure, is leavin things up to\nthe child lesser, than a child runnin wild from mild pressure\nMega.. (mega..) nega.. (nega..) tive\nto live a master plan when that plan has no master\nYou stare at false tongues, leadin the yung'un to disaster\nPostures of this world is seen as mad crooked\nWant your manhood, but man, your dad took it\nWe used to swallow 40's and a whole lot of pride\nNice MC's be frontin on some whole other vibe\nJust because them albums are sealed, doesn't mean\nthem lyrics are untampered with, let's kill the myth\nthat as MC's we know it all, we all children still\nNo tricks for ninety-six, it's due time we build man..\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nYes, stop gassin me, stop gassin me\nAll I wanna do is take my time..\nAll we want to deal, is reality\nJust stop takin me for a ride..\nStop gassin me, stop gassin me\nCause all I wanna do is take my time..\nTake my time, take my time, c'mon!\n",
