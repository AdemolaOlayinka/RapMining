I'd make a mil if it was up to me\nbut since it ain't I teach my seed to bank hard\nand than God, I smoke a substance of a different kind\ncatch me trippin' on earth when I'm high off sunshine\n\ndown right to dirt, Oneder Why makes it work\nwith access to talent like cacaussins to yellow cabs\nwith an Arab driver\nI liven parties with marvelous confiction\nain't no fricition when life claims them victims who be some dried up funds\nbest believe that the life is trife\n'casue the gun made a man outta pussy's from around my way\nwho usually wouldn't have a fuckin' thing to say\nlast year's hard rocks are now petrified boulders\nand L.I.'s finest is movin' yo' necks at shows\nthe anthem of this guy has a place in yo' eye\nso you can be blessed to see in 3d double-e\n",
