    "lyrics": "1996)\nThe instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs\nBe some brothers from the east with some beats that be thorough\nGot the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it\nI gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets\nGun control means using both hands in my land\nWhere it's all about the cautious livin'\nMigrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments\nOf strugglin', that shouldn't be notable,\nMan every word I say should be a hip hop quotable.\n\nI'm sick of bitches shakin' asses\nI'm sick of talkin' about blunts,\nSick of Versace glasses,\nSick of slang,\nSick of half-ass awards shows,\nSick of name brand clothes.\nSick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks,\nCocaine and crack\nWhich brings sickness to blacks,\nSick of swoll' head rappers\nWith their sicker-than raps\nClappers and gats\nMakin' the whole sick world collapse\nThe facts are gettin' sick\nEven sicker perhaps\nStickabush to make a bundle to escape this synapse\n\nMan life can get all up in your ass baby you betta work it out\nLet me tell you what it's all about\nA skin not considered equal\nA meteor has more right than my people\nWho be wastin' time screaming who they've hated\nThat's why the Native Tongues have officially been re-instated\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high\n(Higher than high)\nYou know them stakes is high\n(Higher than high)\nWhen we talkin' 'bout the\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high, you know them stakes is high\nWhen we dealin' with the\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high\n(Hey yo, what about that love?)\n\nYo, it's about love for cars, love for funds\nLoving to love mad sex, loving to love guns\nLove for opposite, love for fame and wealth\nLove for the fact of no longer loving yourself, kid\nWe living in them days of the man-made ways\nWhere every aspect is vivid,\nthese brothers no longer talk shit\nHey yo, these niggas live it\n'Bout to give it to you 24/7 on the microphone\nPlug One translating the zone\nNo offense to a player, but yo, I don't play\nAnd if you take offense, fuck it, got to be that way\nJ.D. Dove, show your love, what you got to say?\n\nI say G's are making figures at a high regard\nAnd niggas dying for it nowadays ain't odd\nInvesting in fantasies and not God\nWelcome to reality, see times is hard\nPeople try to snatch the credit, but can't claim the card\nShowing out in videos, saying they cold stars\nSee, shit like that will make your mama cry\nBetter watch the way you spend it\n'Cause the stakes is high\nY'all know them stakes is high\nWhen we talkin' 'bout the\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high\nI think that smiling in public is against the law\n'Cause love don't get you through life no more\nIt's who you know and \"How you, son?\"\nAnd how you gettin' in, and who the man holding\nHey yo, and how was the scams and how high\nYo what up, huh? I heard you caught a body\nSeem like every man and woman shared a life with John Gotti\n\nBut they ain't organized!\n\nMixing crimes with life enzymes\nTaking the big scout route\nAnd niggas know doubt better\nThan they know their daughters\nAnd their sons\n(Oh boy)\n\nYo, people go through pain and still don't gain\nPositive contact just like my main man\nWho got others cleaning up his physical influence\nHis mind got congested\nHe got the nine and blew it\nNeighborhoods are now hoods cause nobody's neighbors\nJust animals surviving with that animal behavior\nUnder I who be rhyming from dark to light sky\nExperiments when needles and skin connect\nNo wonder where we live is called the projects\nWhen them stakes is high you damn sure try to do\nAnything to get the piece of the pie\nElectrify\nEven die for the cash\nBut at last I be out even though you wantin' more\nThis issue is closed like an elevator door\nBut soon re-opened once we get to the next floor where the\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high\nY'all know them stakes is high\nWhen we talkin' 'bout the\n(Vibes....vibrations)\nStakes is high\nStakes is high, come on\n",
