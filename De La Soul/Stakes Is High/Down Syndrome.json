You gritty like a diamond grenade\nFor the cameo spot you tries to fool Parade\nYou acrobats flip the star gazin map, for alla that\nyou'll be the first to place, and ran it all to a waste\nAnd all the style that you bring (gotta make decks bend)\nYou gotta rip it from the start (when the beats come in!!!)\n",
