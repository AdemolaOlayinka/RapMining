Yes I be\n(Showin others they do not?) Yes I be\n(Havin then towed from the lot?) Yes I be\nThat's my job as a supa emcee, I'm from Long Isle\nMobile, make it worth your while\nIf the jam needs motion I'm the one to dial\n(Goin beyond ninety watts) Yes I be\n(Well are you rockin it?) Yes, yes I be (rockin it!)\n\nI can stress the makin of loot to feed the fam\nWhile the voices impersonate the true who I am\nBuzzin in my ear, oh you one of those wannabees\nAlways buzzin in my ear you down with supa emcees\nSteppin to me with your pleas that you gots, butter rhymes\nMan the only thing butter bout you is your spine\nmad yellow, you can't rock the Mardi Gras, my mellow\nCause my stealth show more than knowledge of self\nI got knowlegde of you, to know you a wack em-crew\n(You mean wack emcee) Nah, a wack em-crew, see you a crew of wack niggaz\nYou should have never tried to test\nThese words that I Man, with the eye/I to Fest\nWhile you sayin one thing really meaning the next\nYou're just a contra-DICK, your mind's been tampered WITH\nLike some holy boooks, but looks to the sky\nCause Wonder Why's here to save the day\n\n(Are you rockin the spot?) Yes I be\n(showin others they do not?) Yes I be\n(Havin then towed from the lot) Yes I be\nCause ultimately, I'm lettin all MC's know that\nwhat's the name of this crew? (De La, De La)\nWell alright, and what be the dish we servin?\n(We servin pos-da!) Posdanos help the next get loose\n\nLike an alcohol scenario rap be on the rocks\nAuthenticity that missin fee to pay to join the flock of MC\nThese niggaz stand lower than knees\nDramatized in they eyes as the ones to please\nWhen rap kids apply violent pressure to father, brother and son\nfor fun to say they inflict pain\nR&B niggaz lie to mother, sister, and daughter\nto have sex disguised as lovin in the rain\nTheir words are more hallow than October 31st\nwhat's worse, hate to see the females\nswitch to sexual mentality, it doesn't match with they given anatomy\nMan they rather be hoes like that male emcee\nWho walk around like they got nuts\nAnd use the tits and ass like a crutch\nMan the underground's about not bein exposed\nSo you better take you naked ass and put on some clothes\n\nman this be goin out to the kids from east smash (long island)\namityville (long island)\nto all my people out in whinedance, bayshore (long island)\nC.I.'s in the place (long island)\nbrinkwood, hempstead, all my (long island)\nbrothers out in roosevelt, freeport (long island)\nuniondale to long beach (long island)\nto them girls out in huntington (long island)\nlong island for real (long island)\n",
