Hey yo you feel that shit (yeah it feels good)
Well it's that thumpin shit (well I'm soakin too)
I'll introduce the split (I'll be the go)
I'll be the get
Fixin with the ins for the outs we set
Hey shortie (yeah mister)
Make no mistake
I challenge the bang for a bigger rhyme bouquet
(you be buggin)
Well i bugs like roaches on rugs
Speaker of the bone like the speaks in my loans
Give me the night baby and I'll be good in the woods
Ya freakin my mind ya freakin my mind
I told the maceo bout the days that go (he know)
I know he know cuz he's out to get the gold
The Chattanooga cruisin' with the malibu shit
The bigger of the isa (cuz he is the shit)
I'm like hickory (dickory niggas)
I make you feel lost like high school history
Creator of the rhymin dominoes
Watchin drop it's the joint see
So hit me with the zsa zsa (indeed darling)
The coolest fool be the coolest fool
I know the watch be in the air but i kick a new bucket
Sippin it wit shortie so check the way we cuff it
It's that indonesia funk up in your trunk
Makin' ya bob bob makin' ya bob
Makin' ya bob bob makin' ya bob
Makin' ya bob bob makin' ya bob
It's that funky shit (in the woods)
That be beyond understandin (in the woods)
Yo we do it with the soul (in the woods)
Timber (in the woods)

Punch that O for operator baby its a love solid
I been stylin abstract since loose leafs was the shit
Catch me breathin on planes where the gangstas outdated
Fuck being hard posdnous is complicated
As my pants play the sagatogah I can order sniffs of
Frequencies frequencies cuz I freak mc's with the rhythm rock live
(man I'd rather point a pistol at ya head and try to burst it)
No jive in the matter so niggas start runnin
Yo that native shit is dead so the stickabush is comin
(stickabush) it's comin (stickabush) it's here
Fuck the five count it only takes three to bring it near
So let me move ya won better as the salad is tossed
And get a taste of the mase that you thought was lost
I'm cautious wit my looks (in the woods)
Pickin them nines in my hair (in the woods)
Sniffin for the beats like litter (in the woods)
The plugs just can't be found (in the woods)

Can I come off like the rest of em I think I should
Could I of course one verse now ya lost it
Found it realizing I came off it sounds mean
But pal there's a new kid on the scene
I got much soul on the down low tip
Lay back smooth one drink I'll be trippin
Never don't you dare consider me a fly gal
Pal I got props on a different tip
I recall back i go for mines I get the goods
Wouldn't you know forgot my compass I got lost in the woods
Found my way and I was out i pronounce every letter
And if I had the chance I'd do it better
I heard a holler down the way and now I'm out for the time being
Ya wanna be in but you can't see what I'm seein
Time and time my friend I stay gettin it on
And now they playin my song again
I got feminine style (in the woods)
I'm not tryin to be sexy (in the woods)
And no you can't knock the boots (in the woods)
A lot of things be happenin (in the woods)
