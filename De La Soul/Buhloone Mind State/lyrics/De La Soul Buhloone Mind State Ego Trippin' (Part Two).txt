Mercy, mercy, (ego trip, ego trip)
Mercy! (ego trip, ego trip), Mercy!!!

Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!
Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!
Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!
Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!

Yep, yep big trucker man's rollin' in town
How ya do, how ya do
I got the joints to make ya...(JUMP!)
Because I'm headin' eastbound
Tired of the merry go round and around
And everybody's talkin' bout you're so funny
But they still tellin' lies to me
I got the trees in my backyard
And it's hard for them to tell a lie to me
And who's the foot, I'm the foot but who's steppin'
(Ain't no half steppin')
You know where I'm steppin'
Skirts play wit it cause I'm slick like that
I'm the greatest MC in the world!!
You gots to gimme gimme mine cause I'm heavy when I weigh it
Watch the way I say it (ego trip)
Change my pitch up, smack my bitch up
I never did it
The flavor's bein' butt but brothers ain't gettin' it
Get it; or else you're a goner
When I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna lamp
Cause it's the chattanooga champ
Takin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...

Now I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
Well I'm the hourglass cat
Drug it out of jack

For jill

Cause I spilled the phenomenon
Pack the holes in my lawn
The girls in my saun(a)
Word is born I'm a livin' phenomenon
Well I'm a better brand cause I'm a superman
I run the block with my circle cause I'm nubian
I got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss
Cause DJ Paul, he's down wit us
Now people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke
I don't sassafrass I put the foot up the ass
Sometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal

When they reminisce over you

For real
Mase chopped the record down to the bone
And now Renee King is on my telephone
But I got the Ring Ring Ha Ha Hey Hey

Cause this type of shit it happens everyday

I got to make me a connection so my imports stuff
(WORD!) Wo, word 'em up
Cause I'm so fly...

Yes on and on
I'm ins like  go buy my yacht
I got Gills like Johnny
Sail at 7 elf (well good for ya)
Bigger than bigs, dig it (I dug it)
Ways that amazes popes
I am the is equals is cause it's caught up
When the tides taught me the ropes
No weights for the baits (man I'll give you four)
For a verb unheard of (man gimme one more)
Alright you got it if you're special
With a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on
(And ain't a damn thing happenin')
The answer to the riddle is me and here's the question
Who can be (fresh)
Who can be (dope)
Who can be (nice)
Who can be (beautiful)
Who can be (word)
Who can be....

Me be the Jericho turnpike bandit
Yes competition try to troupe my way
I sing the song you never heard before
I feed the famine in your mind
So mind ya manners baby
I run a line on ya
Lay ya on the springs then sway ya
All this and a condom cause I be a taxpayer
Promotin' of a moccasin I skin like Danny Boone
When I swallow hear the (gulp)
So give me room just give me room back the hell up

Back the hell up
Know what I'm sayin'

Or when I run the mic there won't be no delayin'
Pressure 40 does it like a Easy Bake oven

Blues got the muffin

Eat it

Blues got the muffin

Eat it!!

Intoxicate many wit my talk without intoxicatin' myself low
So I gots to walk slow but.....

Don't you get too hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
