Whatcha mean BizMark?\nI hit the rhyme with the mayonnaise, that's what I mean\nAh whatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark?\nMan I got beats up my sleeve like you wouldn't BELIEVE!\nWhatcha mean BizMarkie? Whatcha mean BizMark?\n\nAh with my \"ah one two\" I substitute about a loop\nSo let me serve with the slope, with the Plug of two scoops!\n\nMr. Miyag' never did dip for Dove\nBootleggers my legs and, grit about a hug\nAnd who gets the Motts, I knots by the chance\nI rain-dance.. I rain-dance\nBut steppin just a bit I don't need another shadow\nMakes makes, is gonna be the new man's motto\nDon't increase the bull, because my pulley is broken\nand my belly is full\nIt's a second I reckon on the bone and the ball\nMakin London bridges fall, so check it\nI bring a point to the joints that we change and chop\nbut we could bring it back to the beatbox!\n\n\nI'm Posdonus Plug Wonder.. plotter\nSerenade her cause I gotta.. record\nWhen in the womb I was naked.. now I\nchill with latex cause of how I, enter\nthe black wood without a splinter, provin\nI had the chills what helps in movin, asses\nSaw the light cause I got glasses, so we\nsip the cappucino slowly\n\nI'sah makes the big money!\nI drive big\n\ncars, serve the bubble like a bar.. tender\nWhen in flight like a sender, lace\nSticks of dynamite on bass, head\n\nLace the shoe until he dead\n\nRun! Cause the cop is gonna come\nThis my Plug style\n\nso they can kiss my, grits\nHold my balls without a mitt.. grab\nthe mouthpiece to talk the dag.. nabit\nI keeps goin like that rabbit, rico-\n-chet a dame I need a Snicker, satis-\n-fy the Norman to the Gladys, Knight\nMy glasses help me see the light, so we\nsip the capuccino slow\n\nIn life, it's what you see is usually whatcha\n\nget, won't take a Drag-without-a-Net, no\n\nTo put the rhythm in the, bone\n\nmarrow, laid the pipe to please Cari-lou\n\nI don't know!\n\nIf it's true..\n.. THAT'S A FUMBLE!\nWELL CATCH A FEVER FROM THE JUNGLE\nChocolate, nubian girls flock to it, sweets\nAnd if I can't sample beats, get the\nbeatbox equipped with the, dirt\nBizMark and Doug E. works, fine\nMase work the wheel I tangle lines, HARK\nthe light is thirsty in the dark\nso we..\n\n\nIt's like I saw it in the river but my M wasn't fixed\nSuper heavy like a Chevy pump a Maseo mix\nI had some screams in my pockets, and played it kinda hush\nand did the outs (got to check out, the avenue)\nI peeped the Zoah on the gimme gimme, plus we hit the plat'\nThen the amps was on samp's, the villains got fat\nThe Natives weren't the neighbor then to, NIGGA PLEASE\nIt's a hustle for a joint when your settlement G's\nBut we still be on the wax because it acts like that\nWe still be on the moves because it moves like that\nSo there ain't no reason to don't stop\nCause we can bring it back to the beatbox!\n\n\"Yo who, I don't know who was on the mic man\nThis thing smell awful here man..\"\n",
