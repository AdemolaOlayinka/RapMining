(No)\nIs it 212? (No)\nSpeakin' on 404? (Hell no)\nWhat about 516? (I dunno)\nWhat is it? (Not tellin' ya)\nWhat is it? (Not tellin' ya)\nWhat is it? (Not tellin' ya)\nWhat is it? (Not tellin' ya)\n(Huh? What?)\n\n\nJust another area for me to patrol\nI got status 'cause I'm baddest with the paint\nGiving upside down frowns to London wood 703\nHer moms didn't like it, I had to let be\nFor the fact I lays bricks\n'Cause my semen ends with the letter T\nMy seed is hard to submerge\nI play the tack in the wall if my rear's not watched\n'Cause some knuckle might just head for the urge\nBut I got Prince Paul in the Area\n(Oh, it's like that now)\nI got Hot Dog in the Area\n(Heh heh heh)\nI got the Violators in the area\n(Aaah)\nI's got the Violators in the area\n(Aaah)\nIt don't matter where you hide, I clear up the fall\nCop the fuck outta here, you fake-ass fraud\nClear my area\n\n(I'm going home now, I have been up all night.)\n(I been up all night, it's still Friday to me.)\n(Come on now. Hey, Ellory, I'm going home!)\n(Bob to the bob, d-dang, d-dang diggy-diggy)\n",
