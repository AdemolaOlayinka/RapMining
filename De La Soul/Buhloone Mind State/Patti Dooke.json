    "lyrics": "(Why do we have to cross over?)\n(Why are niggas always crossing over, huh?)\n(I mean, what's the matter?)\n(They can accept our music as long as they can't see our faces?)\n\n(One, Two, One Two; You got it)\nWootah!\n\n\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke\n(It's the Patti what?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (Oh!!)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke\n\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke\n(It's the Patti what?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (Oh!!)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke\n\n\nJust the other day I got a starter kit\n(An M is a terrible thing to waste)\nCaught the face from the backs of the border of the mindstate\nI play control to a fraud\n(Nah it ain't happenin')\nNada to make it even\nRobbin' and theivin' is one who infiltrates with a Colgate frown\nY'all remember my nasal for I sniff frequencies\n(Well, it started in the year of '78)\nBut it's '93 or should I say '94 for my style is much more\n(I said, \"Come in\")\nCome in\n(Come on)\nCome out into my reservoir\nAs I macks a men your bastard style has just been stuck\nBy a sticker with a 'frigerator lickin'\nWhat if... how's about why would\nNever thought that the napalm would bust the jeans\n\n\nMash it up\nThe one with the beard\nMega moustache the beat (hide it)\nDeep under sheets, cover this hint\nHostin' all threats but watch out Mr. Jarbage\nJimmy and the jet, standin' on the pier\nI'm known as the farmer\nCultivatin' mate without mendin'\nBendin', comprimising any of my styles to gain a smile\nListen while you hear it\nThere's no pink in my slip\nI reckon that the rhythm and the blues in the rap got me red\nWhile the boys from Tommy plant bridge crossin' to a larger community\nYet they're soon to see I have a brother named Luck\nA nigga named Dres\nA groupie named Cassandra caught bobbin' on the head\nOf a Baby named Chris, I missed a kid who caught wreck when sayin'\n(Afrika and I when Sammy B's on the set)\n\n\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke\n(It's the Patti what?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (Oh!!)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke\n\n(Prevention against sucka M.C.'s)\n(Prevention against sucka M.C.'s)\n(Prevention against sucka M.C.'s)\n(And now, prevention against sucka M.C.'s)\n\n(We decided to change the cover a little bit)\n(Because we see the big picture)\n(Negroes and white folks buyin' this album)\n(Negroes and white folks buyin' this album)\n(Everybody's gonna know who this group is)\n(We just felt that the picture wasn't as important as it was that we\nsucceeed in crossing over)\n(Cross over ain't nuthin' but a double cross)\n(Once we lose our audience we never gon' get them back)\n(He may even try to change our sound)\n\n\nLet no man put asunder\nSeverin' the groups I never blunder\nCashin' all the checks on the mic\nI might cherry to the bush, brand Plug Wonder\nFunk to the fame against hoods\nBridges saggin' to woods down under\nThey can't be raised with the feminine praise\nIn conjunction with no chocolate in the mix\nWhite boy Roy cannot feel it\nBut the first to try and steal it\nDilute it, pollute it, kill it\nI see him infiltratin' to the masses\nAnd when the leechin' I mo shoot 'em all in they asses\n\n\nRunnin' through the trenches (What?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (Yeah!)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti Dooke\n(It's the Patti what?)\nRunnin' through the trenches (Aaah!!)\nRunnin' through the trenches it's the Patti's Dooke\n\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n(It might blow up but it won't go pop)\n\n\nI shed light and not skin\nI ain't from Europe\nAfro connects at the root of the retina of the third\nMums the word when ya blind baby\nBlind to the fact\nDon't rest in Compton so I don't own a gat\nBut respect is clear crystal\nCause Millie got a pistol\nAnd she's down with me\nWild of most wild\nBorn child to the old school legitimate (soul)\nTalker of the many paragraphs ago\nWalker of the plenty broken calves ago\nPhantom of the phrase black in many ways\nCause I see her runnin' through the trenches\nComin' in to rent my style\n\n\nI'm not the one to fuck with\n\n\nI'm lockin' you out\n\n\nI'm just not to fuck wit so check it\nY'all know who I am\nListen up son\nPeace to my man Premier\nAnd y'all better guard your trenches 'cause we runnin' through 'em\n\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n(Do it....fluid....Mess up my mind....)\n\n(Tell me somethin' huh?)\n(How come they never cross over to us, huh?)\n(I never seen five niggas on Elvis Presley album cover!)\n",
