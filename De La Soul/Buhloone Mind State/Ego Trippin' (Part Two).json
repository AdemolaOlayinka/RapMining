Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!\nAaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!! Aaah!!!\n\nYep, yep big trucker man's rollin' in town\nHow ya do, how ya do\nI got the joints to make ya...(JUMP!)\nBecause I'm headin' eastbound\nTired of the merry go round and around\nAnd everybody's talkin' bout you're so funny\nBut they still tellin' lies to me\nI got the trees in my backyard\nAnd it's hard for them to tell a lie to me\nAnd who's the foot, I'm the foot but who's steppin'\n(Ain't no half steppin')\nYou know where I'm steppin'\nSkirts play wit it cause I'm slick like that\nI'm the greatest MC in the world!!\nYou gots to gimme gimme mine cause I'm heavy when I weigh it\nWatch the way I say it (ego trip)\nChange my pitch up, smack my bitch up\nI never did it\nThe flavor's bein' butt but brothers ain't gettin' it\nGet it; or else you're a goner\nWhen I rolls over ya gonna have to wanna lamp\nCause it's the chattanooga champ\nTakin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...Takin' a train...\n\nNow I'm somethin' like a phenomenon\nI'm somethin' like a phenomenon\nWell I'm the hourglass cat\nDrug it out of jack\n\nFor jill\n\nCause I spilled the phenomenon\nPack the holes in my lawn\nThe girls in my saun(a)\nWord is born I'm a livin' phenomenon\nWell I'm a better brand cause I'm a superman\nI run the block with my circle cause I'm nubian\nI got the platinum rust, so don't even fuss\nCause DJ Paul, he's down wit us\nNow people stop takin' my stylin' for a joke\nI don't sassafrass I put the foot up the ass\nSometimes I'm fast, blow off like a seal\n\nWhen they reminisce over you\n\nFor real\nMase chopped the record down to the bone\nAnd now Renee King is on my telephone\nBut I got the Ring Ring Ha Ha Hey Hey\n\nCause this type of shit it happens everyday\n\nI got to make me a connection so my imports stuff\n(WORD!) Wo, word 'em up\nCause I'm so fly...\n\nYes on and on\nI'm ins like go buy my yacht\nI got Gills like Johnny\nSail at 7 elf (well good for ya)\nBigger than bigs, dig it (I dug it)\nWays that amazes popes\nI am the is equals is cause it's caught up\nWhen the tides taught me the ropes\nNo weights for the baits (man I'll give you four)\nFor a verb unheard of (man gimme one more)\nAlright you got it if you're special\nWith a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on\n(And ain't a damn thing happenin')\nThe answer to the riddle is me and here's the question\nWho can be (fresh)\nWho can be (dope)\nWho can be (nice)\nWho can be (beautiful)\nWho can be (word)\nWho can be....\n\nMe be the Jericho turnpike bandit\nYes competition try to troupe my way\nI sing the song you never heard before\nI feed the famine in your mind\nSo mind ya manners baby\nI run a line on ya\nLay ya on the springs then sway ya\nAll this and a condom cause I be a taxpayer\nPromotin' of a moccasin I skin like Danny Boone\nWhen I swallow hear the (gulp)\nSo give me room just give me room back the hell up\n\nBack the hell up\nKnow what I'm sayin'\n\nOr when I run the mic there won't be no delayin'\nPressure 40 does it like a Easy Bake oven\n\nBlues got the muffin\n\nEat it\n\nBlues got the muffin\n\nEat it!!\n\nIntoxicate many wit my talk without intoxicatin' myself low\nSo I gots to walk slow but.....\n\nDon't you get too hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh\n(Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,)\n(Aaah!!
