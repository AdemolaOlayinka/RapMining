Wo, word 'em up\nCause I'm so fly...\n\nYes on and on\nI'm ins like go buy my yacht\nI got Gills like Johnny\nSail at 7 elf (well good for ya)\nBigger than bigs, dig it (I dug it)\nWays that amazes popes\nI am the is equals is cause it's caught up\nWhen the tides taught me the ropes\nNo weights for the baits (man I'll give you four)\nFor a verb unheard of (man gimme one more)\nAlright you got it if you're special\nWith a dapper toe tapper when a lot's goin' on\n(And ain't a damn thing happenin')\nThe answer to the riddle is me and here's the question\nWho can be (fresh)\nWho can be (dope)\nWho can be (nice)\nWho can be (beautiful)\nWho can be (word)\nWho can be....\n\nMe be the Jericho turnpike bandit\nYes competition try to troupe my way\nI sing the song you never heard before\nI feed the famine in your mind\nSo mind ya manners baby\nI run a line on ya\nLay ya on the springs then sway ya\nAll this and a condom cause I be a taxpayer\nPromotin' of a moccasin I skin like Danny Boone\nWhen I swallow hear the (gulp)\nSo give me room just give me room back the hell up\n\nBack the hell up\nKnow what I'm sayin'\n\nOr when I run the mic there won't be no delayin'\nPressure 40 does it like a Easy Bake oven\n\nBlues got the muffin\n\nEat it\n\nBlues got the muffin\n\nEat it!!\n\nIntoxicate many wit my talk without intoxicatin' myself low\nSo I gots to walk slow but.....\n\nDon't you get too hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh\n(Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,\nEgo trip, Ego trip, Ego trip, Ego trip,)\n(Aaah!!
