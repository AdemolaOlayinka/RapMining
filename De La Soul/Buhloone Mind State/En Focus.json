Oh, my...\nBaby, what's wrong with me?\n\n\nFunny funny how time flies\nWhen you have some light on the face\nCause the focus is the fickle\n'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it\nTo the utilize the trickle caught the rush\nBut I play hush\nWhile Andres Titus is the grabbin'\nAs a fan will put the hearts to mush\nLush Dalea would hear the public beat\nThe same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep\nBut as the Knee went Deep\nTo deeper off the charts\nThe album faded to black\nThat's when the amnesia starts\n\n(Curious, curious, curious, curious)\nAren't you Dres from Black Sheep? What are you doing here? Who\nare you here with?\nI'm with my man Pos, you know Pos...\nOh yeah, Positive K, I.. I like him...\n\n(Stickabush, stickabush, stickabush, stickabush)\n\n\nHey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in\nShould I shot it or begin\nI saw bootleggas no shinin'\nI saw Big 4 go get shinin'\nA typical flick was the moment\nWhen the man said\n\"Ain't you?\" Yeah I is 'im\nHush your mouth fallin' in cog\nCaught the light being True dog\nA fist of funk and I pocket that screen\nIn the scene or in between\nGimme but a little bit of the starlight\nI mail my ass to the darkness\nI dig it, I dug it\nI dig it, I dug it\nI wiz it, I was it\nI wiz it, I was it\nOh Lord let me switch it off\nBecause ya find some'll do it all\nFor the light\n(Stop jivin')\n",
