The Plugs\nWe're about to get in this song, \"Church\"\nA.k.a. \"It's Reality\"!\n\nAiyyo, wake up! Wipe the sleep from ya eyecracks\nIt's time to focus y'all, fix ya I-MAX\nIn other words, listen to the brother's words\nIngest these anecdotes with HOPE\nand ya ass, may learn how to COPE\nIt's not always good just to get by\nWho's coverin' ya stakes when ya bet high?\nYou're cha-sin', cars, clothes and rocks\nIdentify with the goods you got\nMake sure it's V-S-One, not\nand perfect, leavin' you one clear\nI really don't care to see ya tattoos there\nI'd rather see you graduate the school year\nBlack folk, go put a book in ya face\nBut first give the hook a taste\nBring the preacher in!\n\nHeal! Heal, y'all!\nWe comin' healin'! {It's real!}\nIt's real! {It's real!} It's real!\nIt's realer than real, realer than real\nHeal! Heal, y'all!\nWe comin' healin'! {It's real!}\nIt's real! {It's real!} It's real!\nIt's realer than real, realer than real\n\nIt's a sick world that we live in, let some tell it\nSome put it in books, some yell it\nYou need to make your own choice, be your own voice\nSet ya soap-box up, let your talk fight\nPull ya socks up, get ya walk right\nOr the chalk might outline ya one day\nYou oughta try steppin' outside you one day\nYou circle round yourself like you the answer\nTo the question of your inner son\nBut keep ya falsehoods to a minimum (minimum )\nWe all need a little church\nA life update, keyword - update\nIf they don't serve change, don't bite the bait\nInstead'a givin' you a share, servin' you a dish\nI lead you to the water, show you how to fish\nAin't nothin' wrong makin' that bread wid'it\nBut don't let the bread get to ya head, geddit?\nAdmit it, when you can't stand alone\nI wanna stand up, give all the pretend up\nAnd get a full blast of my demands of\nthe rhyme runner said the man's come\nThere's something in our words that reveal (reveal )\nSho 'nough real!\n\nHeal y'all! We come to heal!\nSo let it heal you!{It's real!} It's real!\n(It's real!) It's real!\nIt's realer than real, realer than real\nHeal y'all! We gonna heal it!\nSo let it heal! {It's real!} It's real!\n{It's real!} So real!\nIt's realer than real, for real, for real\n\nThe early bird gets the worm in this rotten apple\nBut explore deep and you will the find the seed\nPlant more ether, get your mind free\nWe roll passsionate, put your lights last in it\nYou're holdin fear too close, unfasten it!\nAnd like old age invades youth\nInvade falseness with truth\nReplace rebelling with rebirth\nFace new dwelling, that's your turf\nLean back and put your feet up on the sofa\nRelax! (Relax! ) learn how to punch back\nAnd do your work to the max\nThe payoff's much sweeter than the payback\nEven the haysack needle wouldn't play that\nSo let's pray at, church (church )\n\nHeal! Heal, y'all!\nWe comin' healin'! {It's real!}\nIt's real! {It's real!} It's real!\nIt's realer than real, realer than real\nHeal y'all! We comin' healin'!\nSo let it heal! {It's real!}\nIt's real! {It's real!} It's real!\nIt's realer than real, realer than real\n\nRealityyyyyyy!\nRealityyyyyyy-eeeeeeeeeee-reeeeaaall!\n\n\nYou know what I mean? Rap outsold crack\nYou know, so rap....or hip-hop culture\nhowever you wanna dice it, you know what I'm sayin'\nit's the most powerful drug there is, man\nit changed corporate America, it changed the way you feel about me\nit change the way I, I do my thing now\nBusta was the one who came out, on the award show and said that\nhip-hop provides jobs for people who don't even love the shit\nI mean, come one man, I mean what else is there to say?!\n",
