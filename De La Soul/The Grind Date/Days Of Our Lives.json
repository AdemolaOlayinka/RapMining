(Stayin focused so my mind is free)\nWatch the problems of the world go by like balloons\nIf tomorrow come now (it might be too soon)\nToo soon?\n\nI want the boom in the back of the truck\nAin't nuttin the matter with a good dude havin a buck\nWith that on my mind, I'm on the grind, it pays\nWe break it down in these three ways, yo\nThese days, I travel the Maze like Frank Beverly\nTo the East, lookin for pieces of a better me\nResponsibility of my man's felony fell on me\nCelebrity status, make 'em think I got celery\nHell and I do sometimes, still the sunshine ain't even all day\n(Yeah) The life of a baller, ain't even all play\nI stack 'em, so the chips fall where they must\nI ain't far from a Benz, or dude on the bus\nEven when I don't have enough, still in God I trust\nSaid baby you're a star\nSaid I'm on the car, seen the jiggiest of stars\nbecome dust, and one love become lust for the papers\nHad you gassed now that - gas became vapors\nTricked your cash on ice; shoulda had acres\nNow your, empire fell like the Lakers\nSo you're talkin to your maker\nIt's the nature of the business, they givin niggaz inches\nTakin miles and mules, it's the wildest rules\nI'm tryin to walk in the black scent of proudest shoes\nMakin music that the crowds can use\n\nYo how the days of your life go Dave? (With sunshine and shade)\nThat's it? (Tinted window grades and Kool-Aid)\nWatch the problems of the world go by like balloons\nIf tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)\nToo soon?\n\nI want twenty-four plus on these\nPut the pinto engine and the bus on these\nI get that first class seat to escape the days\nWe break it down in these three ways\nCheck the life I got that antidote, canteloupe scent, bent back\nin the sunroom froze, put your flick on pause (and pop a cork)\nThere's no occasion nigga it's just because\nI'm celebratin for a hell of a day\nGet these barbie filets on hot charcoal tracks, so black\nDarko Pecoltrane plays them back\nWe them freedom fight kids who gon' ball and raise fists\nIf y'all down for the struggle, c'mon y'all, resist\nEveryday script, I exercise cheek\nSixteen on the bar, I exercise speak (ha)\nIt's been a long time, Long Isle's on the map\nWhile y'all stand on the corner, stoned like Chris\nKiss back, watchin time - wrist back\nEvery second count but just finish this lap\nYou gamble on your life like casino slots\nand cash out and still walk with a knot\n\nYo how the days of your life goes Merce? (Man I'm just holdin my head)\nThat's it? (Shit, I'm also tryin to hold this bread)\nWatch the problems of the world go by like balloons\nIf tomorrow come now (that might be too soon)\nToo soon?\n\nI furnished the rooms, and mortgage on these\nSee them quittin ass rappers caused a shortage on these\nThe soul boys of big illa-noyz get the praise\nWe break it down in these three ways\nMy moms died from secondhand smoke; so I wish yo' ass would die\nfrom them secondhand rhymes you wrote\nOr shall I call them second rhymes - written seconds 'fore you enter the booth\nWords thrown together with very little truth\nAnd a select few can do it (true) you ain't part of them scriptures\nAnd got the nerve to feel you want me out the picture\nBut I was never in it, I'm the frame around the flick\nOr dishin in the mouth of your dame around my dick\nLadies and gentlemen, introducin Workmatic\nOne of L.I.'s finest, and this is \"MY LIFE\"\nWhich is filled with bad minutes and good hours\nand, good months and bad years and with my peers\nwe struggle to juggle the shit\nFamily life and the music game don't easily fit\nMy lady wants me home, sayin rap tour three rap whores\nand scores of scandal, even more than we can handle\nSometimes, the rhymes I say\nIs the fly the currency to save the day\nCan't turn it away, cause we out\nto find presennce way beyond our measure, so baby don't pout\n\nDon't pout, De La Soul now turn it out\nDon't pout, Common Sense'll turn it out\nDon't pout..\n",
