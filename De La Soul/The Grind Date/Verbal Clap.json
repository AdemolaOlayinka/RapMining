Louder!\nWell clap your hands to what he's doing\nOn tempo Jack\"\n\nNYC gave you the ball, so how you gonna hate us?\nWe creators of them East coast stars\nIf you ask me I'll tell you there's no comp\nBut I'm still humble, even though I will crumble halls\nSome call 'em songs, I call 'em words from me\nthat take long to cook\nSo some feel free in sayin that we don't hunger for beats\nNot that we not hungry, just picky in what we eat\nKeep food off the mind and keep weight off the body\nAll you gotta do is keep my name out your mouth\nAnd stop frownin like you hostile\nYou know that it's a booger rubbin up against your nostril\nNigga how you figure you can play this rap game without the backbone?\nIt's Maseo, Dave, Wonder Why, givin what you lack holmes\n\nAiyyo prepare yo'self for the Neutron, bitch!\nThis is eighty-six, let that neo-rap go\nWe present these flares to put fire to your ears\nto lay smoke like rusty exhaust pipes\nWe run mics, let Sean run the marathon\nYo raise that money son, we raisin these kids\nGet claps when curtains close, stage left\nUp your stamina baby, bring some breath\nSAT book smart, part ese\nLoc'in like Tone, street niggaz get grown\nAcquire more couth before you get poofed\nOr get some shells sent over to your mic booth\nExcuse, my delivery, but when peace don't work\nsee this piece gon' work, cock aim and SHOOT!\nIt's my constitutional right to bear arms\nArms and bare hands on mics, make fans unite\nWoodstock and white folks involved\nBlack man get on yo' job!\n\"Well clap your hands to what he's doing\nOn tempo Jack\"\n\nLet's go beat for beat, and rhymes for rhymes\n(put, all, the things aside)\nJust bring your beats, and bring your rhymes\n(put, all, the things aside)\n\nThe heavyweight L.I. brother with no date, of expiration\nOn this fate on the mic, them birthday keep comin\nI'm hated on by niggaz I love most\nSo what threat could you possibly pose when I'm on your coast?\nSo raise your guns or your glasses\nEither way there'll be a toast in the air\nMarkin the return of bare minimums you need to learn\nGet your verbs right when you down to clap\n\nSee that gun powder calibre rap'll tip hats like gentlemen do\nSmash tenements and skyscrapers\nBow-tie papers stacked high\nPay the resident tax or get your street sweeped\nFront row, backstage or the cheap seats\nI (Dodge) richochets like (Ram) trucks, you slow poke to pull it\nAnd I sup-pose you wanna top the Billboard chart\nMan I toast these rhymes and then pop like Pop-Tarts\n\n\"Well clap your hands to what he's doing\"\n",
