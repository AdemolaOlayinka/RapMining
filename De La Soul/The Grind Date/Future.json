Well try standin over\nseven box sets, reppin sixteen years\nThis rap career ain't work, it's the life in-between\nbedtime 'til the next said time and date\nKnow the name and salute them dudes\nPut the nutrient in rap when they cook them foods\nGotta be like eighteen million heads served\nShit, imagine if there wasn't no us huh?\nSo I'd like to take the time to shout out the JB's\nNext on my list is A Tribe Called Quest\nLatifah my Queen, Monie Love, Dres and Mr. Lawnge\nChi-Ali, on your head God bless\nNever ring chasin, the permanent tat\nin this rap shit, y'all are just temporary lick-ons\nFadin in the days to come\nWhile the name De La and the legacy built lives on\n\nWe are singing (sing it out now)\nyou this message (sendin you a message y'all)\nThrough our music (through the music)\nreaching for a, brave and brighter new tomorrow\n(another day y'all) is the future (it's the future)\n(it's the future) We must make it (we gotta make it)\nsafe and happy, for the children (for the children)\nYou little brats\n",
