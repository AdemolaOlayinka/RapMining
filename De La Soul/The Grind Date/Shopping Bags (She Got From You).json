I'M RELOADED!\"\nNigga you shootin blanks\nTryin to front like you got game\nHer crib is sugar coated, like she lootin banks\nBut it's your wallet she done claimed\nWhen the limit of your plastic, reaches the end\nYou start payin for your time\nShe'll be in it for the last bit, of money to spend\n(HA, HA HA) And you'll be left with dimes\nWhile she fillin up\n\n\n\n\nShe got from you, she, sh-she, she got it\nShe got from you, she, sh-sh, sh-she got it\n",
