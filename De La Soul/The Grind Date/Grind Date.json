I'm sick of askin' that\nI mean, the street philosophy is that\nI'm gonna milk the cow and cook the meat\nat least I'm gonna have some kind of food and drink\nbecause sometimes you can't come back\nlike momma said that if you need 5 cents don't ask for 3\nask for 10, that's for sure\nYo fuck a rhyme artist, I ain't here for that\nI was born with the boom bap, respect the name\nmy hands on experience was hands on my first contract\ntaught me quick how to respect the game\nintroduced to the block, got used to the block\nbut your neighbors be the ones who throw shit on your lawn\nit's like every single time we pop, they got annoyed\nbut we got ahead, and we got along\nand puttin' work on the calendars, worse on them calendars\nworth of hump days that broke the camel's back\nthe grind'll make today look gray\nand paint a tainted picture of tomorrows in enamel black\nmeet the rhyme, street grind, son whatever the beast\nI'm a take it at the horns till the pinky toe torn\nand show you why we here this long\ncause when it comes to puttin' in work\nonce again it's on\nI'm just like everybody else man\nan average nigga with above average potential\nyou know what I mean? I'm not sayin' that I'm a gentleman\nI'm sayin that I know how to act like a gentleman\nin order to get the things that I need\nand if I gotta pull out my nickle bag, I'm gonna do that\nThis ain't no accident, we stayin' here\nYou damn right I am proud of myself man\nand I'm proud of my team man\nI don't want you to get the wrong, yo baby on the real?\nI don't have sex with people I do business with neither\nand that's the real\nbut I do do business with people that I have sex with\nso if there ain't no conflict, let's get this grind on\ncause I'm gonna fuck the shit outta you, that's word\n",
