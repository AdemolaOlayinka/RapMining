What you need to do is get back\nto reading credits, we them medics\nalphabetically stuck on that English shit\nnow, quick now, before we pour that\nsureshot pure Rock Co.Kane Flow\n\n\nFrom the top of the key, the 3 Villain\nBeen on in the game as long as you can wheelie your Schwinn\nTurn the corner spinnin, bust that ass and get up\nDust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up\nHe got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline\nHe said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine\nTo write all night long, the hourglass is still slow\nFlow from Hellborn to free power like Lilco\nAnd still owe bills, pay dues forever\nSlay you(s) when it comes to who's more cleverer\nUsed to wore a leather goose \"V\" with the fur collar\nHand charged a fee for loose leaf, words for dollar\nYa heard? Holla -- broad or dude we need food\nEat your team for sure, the streets sure seem rude\nFor fam like the Partridges, pardon him for the mix-up\nBattle for your Atari cartridges or put your kicks up\nIt's a stick up\n\n\nNow put your blix up, these Riddick Bowe cuts\nis swoll like penile flicks, give 'em 20\nThe danger in his eyes'll let you know he's a brawler\nBring your tallest champs like that much taller\nTen pounds heavier, one step ahead of it\nVocab, stamina, style's all irrelevant\nCamps and cliques, units, squad crews and clans\nEven your tongues'll fuck around and leave your mouth\n\n\nDoom brung that bum, there goes that news van again\nAct like you knew like Toucan Sam an' 'em\nHe eat rappers like part of a complete breakfast\nYour rhymes ain't worth the weight of they cheap necklace\nString 'em up, bring 'em up under whack junk snack\nAnd get that out your hand, punk, jump and get your dunk smacked\nfoul, we all know the rules bro\nYou slow, you blow the soup on your fools, his Impulse like Yugo\n\n\nYou go lights, camera, action with no makeup\nWe De La to the death, or at least until we break up\nHere's a couple of nice guys who finished first\nSo nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed\nThey say the good die young, so I added some\nbad-ass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum\nEveryone cools off from bein hot\nIt's about if you can handle bein cold or not!\nAnd we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul\nWe stayed original ever since y'all\nFirst to do a lot of things in the game, but the last to say it\nNo need to place it on a scale to weigh it\nAnd don't do it for the plays or to raise the bar\nYet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are\nthe three L.I. brothers from a other way of thinkin\nHey your lady's winkin, I think you need to control that whore\nor I('ll) have to hold that\n\n\nThe elements are airborne, I smell the success\n(Yo let's cookie cut the shit and get the gingerbread, man)\nSacrifice mics and push drugs to these rappers\nPuff ponies 'til I turn blue in the lips\nSippin broads like 7-Up (ahh) so refreshing\nI finger pop these verses like first dates to birthdates\nSeptember 2-1, 1-9, 6-8\nToo old, to rhyme? Too bad, too late\n",
