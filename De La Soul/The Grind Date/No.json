Then after that\nPut in a little more practice on your rhymin attack\nWhat you write's not the least bit hot\nMaybe cause your wrist is so cold from all that ice you cop\nHate to hate a playa but you know what?\nI still smother ya like cheese and rockin leaves freshly cut\n\nAnd we the steak and potatoes and De La's the greatest\nAnd ladies be on the floor thankin the Lord that He made us\nI'm tellin you, I swoop her like a pelican do\nYou sayin - look at that pelican fly; you spittin gelatin rhymes\nThey shaky as shit, ugly in the mold you fit\nWe the square peg on the round hole, sound's soulful\nYour imitation flavor is tofu\nIt's true we make our bed all day, and we are..\n\n.. the world of rap! Take you back\nin the days of all four hundred ways that people lack\nIt's that (what) authentic, big-nosed mic music\nFour to five survive all night to it\nI'm tryin to keep up with my Jones' and Thomas'\n'til I'm broke like them New Year's Eve promises\nAnd that's alright, I just penned another sixteen\nto fill my bank account with the mixed greens\n\nMoms want 5's and 10's\nThe girls I got is 9's and 10's, VH1 \"Behind The Pens\"\nYou anticipate greatness from elder statesmen\nI ch-ch-ch-AHH, like Biz Mark' or Jason\nI bust one shot just to start the racing\nThe tortoise and the hare, which one there is chasin?\nSlow and steady, we already Andretti\nGet ticket take parades, waves and confetti and..\n\nCome on y'all\n\nIf the Soul keeps rockin, the streets will keep rockin\nIf the streets keep rockin, the Soul will keep rockin\nIf the streets stop rockin, the Soul will keep rockin\nIf the Soul keeps rockin, the streets will keep rockin\n",
