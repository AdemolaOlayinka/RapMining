He comes\"\n\n\nDown, like water, fresh out the clouds clown\nDrown you like terrible weather\nNobody does it better than I, so approved by Carly Simon\nMost rappers is real hard, but still hardly rhymin\nTo all - rise and shine - give God the glory\nI already give a percent of mine to Bert & Cory\nAnd still got bills and employees to pay\nSo excuse me Lord, we'll settle up towards the end of my days\nMy ways of control is hard to swallow\nKnown to lead, but some would rather see me follow behind\nSorry to dis-appoint, but dis joint's mine\nDis-play your indie but say no -\n- more or I'll blind you like spit did to Remo\n- to the dirt - and edit the clip and lost Kano\nMy mens wear problems like Timbs\nSee it all in they face, ask Mase, he got wars to win\nScores to settle, crews to crush\nYou rush right in to see him do it with a smile\nIt's Long Isle y'all, longevity sustainin my celebrity status\nFrom AM to PM, you see him on file y'all\nI was told to step righteous, so when it's done\neveryone will say I stepped right\nAnd whether through religion, or stopped by the cop\nshinin his flash in my face, I'm bound to see the light\n\n\"A few short words, and whaddya know?\"\n\"Oh, whaddya know? He comes\"\n\n\nAiyyo I'm up against these walls, here's my back stiff straight up\nDazzle and razzlin broads like I'm little Juan Magic\nMagnetically handle mics, they don't drop\nTop drama every time these commas don't drop\nPop spots like lint on your shirt, the net worth\nto shoot the rock homey in many courts of ball\nFour couldn't do it, so we bring all six\nI circumcise the track, you just a dick - overlapped and hooded\nSkin repeated like Stutterin John\nI repeat like yesterday, it don't stop\nGeorge of this poor life pop, put to Scarlet\nin a place she believes, much better than your lies\nShe say she lookin better in my eyes, bullshit!\nSame crock she done ran to duck, crammin to fuck\nI put the pudding on her like Bill Cosby\nI tried to speak my piece in court but Judge Mills paused me\nBifocusedly die hopeless sometimes\nYo cry your poker face, you oughta try it one time\nWhen God is an non pos', you stand to download\nDemanded like slaves on trial - we want free\nMan cock aim ready, it's time you MC\nSo you rappers bust bee-bee guns, graffiti runs\nthrough my veins since cable with the wired remote\nWoodgrainin like you wired his float\n\n\nC'mon, Pretty Toney and De La Soul\nWe was rhymin through the frozen street since 8 years old\nTake us back to eighty-eight, you couldn't catch our flow\nA group of kids so original\n\nYou heard?\n\n\n\n\nTony 'Tana with big hammers for bad manners who got 'em\nWe kiss cannons for Scrangelous crew, and his whack dancers\nBitin is forbidden pah, pay that tax\nAnd don't you ever look at us funny - boy, we'll bring rap back\nAnd that'll hurt you like Superman, chased by a group of men\nwith dyna-mics, real hip-hop'll do you in\nFor you like Loo Goo Kim, or Moo Loo Inn\nHula hoop all bitches crew full with brand new Keds\nCutmaster kill 'em, make sure we cut classics\nBuck bastards in broad day and tuck caskets\nNext to Uday and Qusay, how can the group shoot the PA\nand just lay whooptay whooptay?\nUse the ruse, sport beads and snatch a dude's toupee\nSince tunin into T-La Rock'n AJ\nGhostface gats is freshed squeezed like a glass of OJ\nGirls you can go cruisin in my OJ\n\n\"A few short words, and whaddya know?\"\n\"Oh, whaddya know?
