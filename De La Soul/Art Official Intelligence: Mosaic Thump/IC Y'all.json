Y'all (see y'all) I.C. Y'all\nLadies get down shake yo' ASS around, I hope you know that\nI.C. Y'all (see y'all) I.C. Y'all\nTo all my soldiers on the corner I.C. Y'all (see y'all)\nWomen doin what they wanna I.C. Y'all\nTo them people gettin pulled over I.C. Y'all (see y'all)\nI.C. Y'all (see y'all) wouldn't wanna be y'all\n\nIt's the one and only effect, that you catch from a cassette\nStraight wig out the world and girls we straight dig out ya back\nwith letters spellin out my name\nAll over your marquee, cause the spark is me\nCurrently we can be seen across your screen\nStayin wide-eyed cause you niggaz tryin to scheme\nWelcome to the spot - I'm slaying with it\nChop it up and fit it inside your quart of rice\nYou speak ghetto falsetto on the mic device\nTryin to give me third degree, you just a third of me\nCouldn't be the shit if you were a turd of me\nA man tight with my funds, crush like Ricky D\nwho quoted Vance Wright - no one can serve us!\nMy squad advance heights quite superb\nJust kick off your shoes - jump on the jock\nIt's been a long time comin this you NEED to cop!\n\n\nIt goes one (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)\nBounce so much I ricochet up off the floor (floor)\nSo raw shit the most raw you ever saw\nQuarter after four, niggaz quick to bust the back door\nBaby - open your blouse while I joust another nigga's spouse\nQuick Jamaican dick style all in they house\nI practice to be the all access, you see the fact is\nmy mouth dirty, so follow while I display the slackness\nYo, you see my slang talk straight from the slums\nWhen I was young, moms put soap on my tongue, and yo-yo\nForever we gettin this CHEDDAR with the quickness\nWhile I cast the spell on these bitches, you can be my eyewitness\nShort fuse, nowadays Langston Hughes\nWe gettin money with whoever - even the Jews\nThe way we finagle and gain it must be all in my shoes\nFuck a nigga up with De La like can amuse\n",
