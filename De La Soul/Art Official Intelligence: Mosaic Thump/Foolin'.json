Now look what I get\nA whole string of party people wanna run in my mix\nIn my world they wanna fit like melanin in a tit\nJam tight, they ain't my fam alright? They ain't my people\nThem niggaz screamin fam til they rank measure equal\nthen vote, without leavin a note, and that was all she wrote\nArranged produced my slang's obtuse\nbut some distort, tellin stories like Mother-the-Goose\nMy true fam's back since with Vince Mason\nWe'll draw on three, leave that body for the tracin\nUltimate high, like them drugs you be lacin\nCoulda stood next to me, at the top of the key\nbut you had to play gutter, didn't want to climb\nNow you find yourself talked about in my rhyme\n\nWhile you fools claim corners, we gon' claim theories\nY'all some stickball niggaz, we the World Series\nBeen here, just pleadin the same case\never since we spaced about \"3 Feet\"\nPinchin your ears, inchin for years\nbut you still stuck at the mezzanine and\nwe at the penthouse level with the same old rugs\nsame old tubs, same old tables and same faults\nSame crew and the same old train of thought\n\nMy guess you need to head West (who you foolin)\nThought we'd fall for your phonyness you're (only foolin)\nyourself, thought you were down - it takes more than a smile\nand a couple of pounds to be crew\nMan you bound to get your tail caught (who you foolin)\nSpreadin yourself thin see you're (only foolin)\nyourself, thinkin all you need is the wealth\nYou need to peep your whole circle out\n\nYo, since Jam Master Jay been rockin without a band\nand that sister k.d. lang been sexin without a man\nwe brought our ultimate plan to birth\nPut in work for this game, it's not a game to me\nWe've been furnished the props\nNow we out to furnish properties we own\nThat's right (so) cats might know we ain't home\nMy throne's threatened by fiends, try to do dirt\nPlay Tony Randall - have that ass cleaned\n\nUnveiled I see your exhibition, y'all need to cover that\nFatherless styles, y'all really need to mother that\nSame expose, different page\nbut when you see me in it it's the same old Dave\n\nY'all silly, you're just a civili', I'm a soldier\nTroopin in this path til the death won us over\nSo if life is a party begin, to understand\njust like the DJ, we stayin to the end\n\nHow you think you gon' get away? (who you foolin)\nChangin faces on the regular you're (only foolin)\nyourself, big top status, paintin your face\nWho you think you really gonna fool huh?\nWe watch, what we got so (who you foolin)\naround on my premises you're (only foolin)\nyou, into thinkin you can break in too\nmy place, and not have to face, our position\nWho you foolin.. only foolin\n",
