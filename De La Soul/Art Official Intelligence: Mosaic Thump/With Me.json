Have you misread my shyness for conceit?\nI'm peepin how you move it to the pace of the beat\nGot my eyes on wide as they constantly collide with yours\nYour heavenly body rushin the tide to shore\nYour heavenly body rushin these guys to the floor\nto find pleasure in your double digit design,\nbut these clowns look hurt\nAnd as a woman's ex-nigga I'm a woman ex-pert\nUnderstandin how the ovaries and all that shit work\nExtremely dreamy, my eyes you look surprised\nthat I'm movin closer - don't be, I'm supposed to D.C.\nAre you for real or a tease?\n\nNow let that drink set in sweet, we up close and personal\nAin't nuttin dull about this, sharp like Swiss precision\n(Caught you watch-in) my every move from the door\nTeran escortin us to V.I.P., we live in D.C.\nShoestring dress I wanna fuck and make your hair look a mess\nSuckin the straw huh? You know the head game\nFirst place chick girl I'm all about winnin too\nI want my trophy life-sized in a see through\n\nThis ain't your average, whippin your batterage\ndrivin song that probably isn't your type\nSo I type it long with that ink that won't budge\nor smudge off your memory; courtesy of SkyTel\nMy mail, pop up like some bubbles found on VH-1\nAlso need the math to your color pH-1\nNot the old man in the club who needs his dub to get rubbed\nbut sound the buzzer, I'm comin to sub\n",
