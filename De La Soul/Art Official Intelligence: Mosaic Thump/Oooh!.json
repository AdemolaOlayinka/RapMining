(Brick City)\n\nYo, don't scandalize mine\nI spent too much time\nStraight talk with the catch to etch my line walk\nNever fetchin for crime, halt! Who goes there?\n\nYo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear\nShinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare\n\nWhile we rockin it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)\nLike the little ball inside the spray can\nProviding three coats for both child, woman and man\n\nGod bless the God, lay these Streets Wall to Wall\nIt go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry click\nIt went - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\n\nIt ain't my fault your ass is on the ashphalt\nGot your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see\nI'm iced out like a glass of tea\nBetter yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me\nSlidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D\nWhy try? Maseo be gettin high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'\nMan, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game\nLike them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin is the past drug\nA life filled with (TWEET) that's what thugs love\nSnatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice\nwhile it muffles your voice\n\nNow when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold\nCause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up\nWe run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss\nFlashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss\n\nMost crews are post-current while we're forever\nDirect beats that's contagious, loved by all ages\nGraduated from the you-and-I-versity\nof hard-hitters, for real\n\nI got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine\nAnd get - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, if you a fat chick gettin your fuck on tonight\nThen go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound\nGo - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, and to my broke niggaz on the corner holdin me down\nGo - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\n\nYo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong\nI had plans to buy more land, plant corn\nBust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks\nSet backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile\nRockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat\nBig money's make the big decisions\nKeep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission\nBack to the second half of the feature flick\nDick stacks and fuck rap\n\nI had a name for makin paper since paper mache\nNow my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play\nWhile you broke niggaz reach drunk much quicker\nYou don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor\nWent from God to God damn\n\nDamn God, you're killin it\nShould incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it\nRap cats talk with no will in it\n\nSoundin like they virtual\nThis joint'll hurt you, yo\n\nTwas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed\n(shhh shhh shh, shhhhh) They did a job\nTook all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's\nof shiny-suit rappers and flossin emcees\nwho fail at takin it to rhyme degrees\n\nMan, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes\nYou need to not get nappy with me\nOr else we gon' \"relax your mind, let your conscious be free\"\n\nYo, where my Wall Street niggaz, if ya up in the stands\nGo - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nTo my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man\nGo - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, if you never been shot or stabbed\nBrick City go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\nYo, I gotta catch a cab back to the lab so I can smoke\nGo - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!\n",
