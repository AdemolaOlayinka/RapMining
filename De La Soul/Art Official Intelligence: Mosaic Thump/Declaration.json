Heard your shit, back in style baby!\"\n.. heard the De La, said I'm back in style y'know?\nHeh..\n\n\"You-you-you.. you need to stop\"\n\"I declare that only live niggaz rap this year\"\n\"Jam's off the meter yo, this {shit} is hot\"\n\"There's always ONE.. (ONE!)\"\n\"Amateurs get hung with they own gold chains\"\n\"There it is!!\"\n\"I declare that only live niggaz rap this year\"\n\nThe average MC sells terror\nWe nail terror up against the wall for target practice\nNot one of your top five MC's\nbut I see clearly with ease you lack this\nCoast to coast, we pop up on your scene like toast\nplayin host to your regiment\nwho rally to boast, but now boast no more\nThey got floored by the sight of my ledger print\nI came specifically, to fracture yo' ability\nto grandstand anywhere next to me\nThis is the year, when the true better man\nkeeps the cheddar and writes to his destiny (word!)\nTimeless episodes of talent got me nominated\nby the ones who hated me on spittin tighter\nSalute these \"Supa Emcees\" for bein clever;\nand never use the weed as a ghost writer\n\n\"I declare that only live niggaz rap this year\"\n\"Jam's off the meter yo, this {shit} is hot\"\n\"Run a rapper through a maze like a experiment\"\n\"Yeah, word up!\"\n\"I declare that only live niggaz rap this year\"\n\nContrary to popular truth, these youth are runnin scared\nso in one stare they gettin strapped\nCash rules NUTTIN from below the belt\nThe dick choose to melt asses where them dollars at?\n(Where them dollars at?) Musta been bitten by a rabbit\nActin silly like that; your pop culture need a diaper change\nI'm snatchin the mic, like I'm lootin\nwith a whole lot of shootin while you're keepin out of sniper range\nYour aim's to please, my aim's to freeze\nyou dead center in your tracks with your hands high\nAin't no tricks, we set it to fire like Hendrix\nAll the hard rocks at liquor spots\nAll over the scene, makin it messy\nso we make a clean getaway to a better day\nCan't say the same, for them cats who left the game\ncause they couldn't claim the better pay\nThis ain't no masquerade\nso the mass parade of people need to stop frontin\nThere's truly a few makin them hits\nwhile us, we got our mitts closed cause you on the field buntin\nMake it to third bass, but never reach home\nThe word is, your whereabouts is unknown\nWhile we're that point of view, that you never really knew\nwith the stitch to keep the cut sewn (De La!)\n\n\"I declare that only live niggaz rap this year\"\n\"Jam's off the meter yo, this shit is hot\"\n..\nROCK A BYE BABY!! ON THE TREE TOP!!\nWHEN THE WIND BLOWS!! THE CRADLE WILL ROCK!!\nROCK!! RO..\n",
