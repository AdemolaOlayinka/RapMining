Just one more time!\"\n\n\nIt's the M-I-K, E ohh to the D\nI'm comin exquisite and V.I.P.\nTryin to spread some love like roots on a tree\nStayin true to this vision in the Y2G\n\n\nTwo G's got em scratchin it like the fleas\nAnd Ad Rock got it locked like a crooked cop\n\n\nNoooooowww; it's Ad Rock, y'all remember me\nThe guy ya bit ya style from off the TV\n\n\nI score Mmmma-Zah-Ayy's all day, my essays are felt worldwide\nWe like four planets on the mic\nAligned arrays retired all in the days\nGame (baby-baby) too blam for these lames\n\n\nWhen I was nine, I played with slime\nGot rhymes ga-lot, got rhymes ga-limes\nI got a million like rhymes leavin ya stung\nI got my own crew called the nasal tongue!\n\n\nYo take a few of these b-boys and call me in the mornin (okay)\nKeep it on the crusty eye, bagel with some butterflies\nSpit gritty like we in MCA's voice box\nY'all bull and my ox don't fit the mix\n\n(Disc jock!) It be some classic material kid\n(Disc jock!) Got the calm cats blowin their lid\n(Disc jock!) You get plush off the rack\nand buy plenty or more we got em by the stack\n(Disc jock!) Got us walkin all over the world\nfor all the fly fellas and all the fly girls\n(Disc jock!) You can't get enough when we servin this\n\n\nCome on - SQUAT!\n\n\nNow we'd like, to introduce to you, Ad Rock\n\n\nAd Rock in the house you don't stop!\nIt's the B-E-A-S-T-I-E B-O-Y-S with the most finesse\nDon't mean to be crude, don't mean to be crass\nBut listen Guiliani you can kiss my ass (what?)\nYou heard my word, now Dove you play the preacher\nGet on the mic if you love all the creatures\n\n\nWell yeah I got these fishes swimmin round my baracuda\nBack in '82 I used to ride a street scooter\nCalled em cuter than pigtails, sales you keep em level, and\nsmack you with a shovel and break your lifestyle (owww!)\nFirm on the mic since my days of a child\nGot a \"License +TOO+ Ill\" to flash to police\nThe only beast I huddles with the Beastie Boys\nBringin \"Noise\" like P.E. to your TV\n\n\nAiyyo this beat's barefoot and knock-kneed\nStripped to the rhyme!\nAnd every line made from scratch\nAttached like stripes to shell-toes\nThin spools that hold the herb\nMike what's the word? (WORD!)\n\n\nIt's like the ooh-la-la, ooh-ooh-la-la\nRhymin over old breaks like the Mardis Gras\nParty people cross and bump they go ooh and they ahh\nAnd Mike D and Ad Rock down with the De La\n\n(Disc jock!) Get the people dancin for real\n(Disc jock!) Theater (jock!) holdin mass appeal\n(Disc jock!) You can't get enough STILL\nso here's another dose for you to feel!\nPut ya body in it!\n\n\nCome on - SQUAT!\n\n\nI'm feelin good, damn good, but also confused\nThis stuff from hip-hop that's bein misused\nIt's desirin, acquirin, tryin to be like Iverson\nif it means backstabbin and also conspirin\n\n\nNowwww, the people in the front - you do the bump bump\nThe people in the back - they're not the whack whack\nThe people in the middle - come on and wiggle wiggle\nAnd the people on the side - we can all take a ride!\n\n\nIn my VW I done swung an ep' or two\nThe rear in my hatchback y'all know I scratched that\nHere to haystack, keep it rosy in the Rolls\nSkiddin out to place my vote at the polls for Ad Rock\n\n\nWell I'm the the toe tapper, yes the hand clapper\nFrom the middle school like the educated rapper\nI'm known as an occupational MC\nYou think I lose sleep if you sleep on me?!\n\n\nIts the rock solid, pilot, here to fly (ROCK!)\nReachin elevations too far for the eye (EYE!)\nMiraculous beats over breaks in these packages\nSeen (all over the globe) and all the types\nwho thinks our joints is aight, here's a swab for ya ear\n(to clean out ya lobe) and listen to a few views\nfrom two crews spittin for the art of it\nWe ain't takin over but damn sure takin part of it\n\n\nStarted it ever since we minced meat\nYou Sloppy Joe's went and took a bit of the corn dog\nStay there! I'ma play there (cuz they pay there)\nIn the big old Santa Claus bag got discs and now we out\n\n\nSignin off, signin off, our work is done\nSo come on party people..\nHave (have) have (have) have FUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!\n\n\"..
