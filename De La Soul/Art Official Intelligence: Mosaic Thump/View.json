We bout to get it (get it) get it (get it)\nget it (get it) get on down (down) down (down)\nYo!\n\nWe run it, HOT! When we over the drums\nTo the, TOP! Cause the bottom we're from\nWe got the, DROP! On your weekend crew\ncause you're full-time talkin while we peepin your view\n\nRahubat, you know my name\nI run my humbleness with fame\nGod-body, nuttin plain\nwhile you claimin shepherd that you heard this\nyou, heard this on day first\nWatch my man, he'll make it worse\nAin't no new click, we still Native\n\nClothes knit, stitched tight, related\nthat's the way we handle it\nPin us up or mantle it\nWe on fire you candle lit\nDaydreamin, on a rack\nGet bought worn and brought back\nWe sport rhyme thought real tight\n\nto gain sizes much bigger\nLife life well, get mail filled with\nchecks from sales we deliver\n\nSpend a little, make a little\nI want it big like white boy wallets\nCredit delievered, Fed-Excellent\nTo my dot com, we on the web like Charlotte's\nHornet, back her up, she too much on it\nYour plastic ass'll get swiped\npast the limit see you the type\nto get yo' cosmetics smeared on pillows all night\n\n\nwhile we peepin your view\nwhile we, peepin your view\nWe got they eyes on lock\nLet them flock to your wit while I spit after you\n\nLook ma, I'm still rhymin\nBaby boy still providin\nBreakin bread in four states\nMakin these struggles get gone\nPrivate eyes, I see y'all spyin\nYou watch while I clock\nFertilize my brain data\nMakin accounts grow green like the front lawns\n\nYo I may be old school\nbut I'm not no old fool\nHeard out your mouth words flee\nbout \"These niggaz ain't nice\"\nYou just barbershop talkin\nwhile we round the world walkin\nB, you ain't D.M.C.\nYou slip and fall on my ice\nNo lyin, straight shinin\nI give you supper from my upper diamond\nYou got limbs so climb in\n\nYo, soak up what you find-in\nWe too pure for you to try\nYou sniffin maybe's and if's\n\nAnd if \"if\" was a spliff\nMan we'd all be hiiiiiiiiigh-iiiiiigh.. iiiggghhhhh..\n\n.. but it's not, so sober up\nYou flashin out like you paparaz'\nYou'll need to take a liver shot\nto feel the heat on how we runnin it, YO\n\n\ncause you're full time talkin while we, while we\nwhile we lettin you know I'm in a\ncertified rhyme meadow for days\nIf you ask Mercenary bout this shit, it pays\nHitting Willie Mays style out the park\nMastering in this (Art) that's (Official)\nYour ears absorb this like tears, on a tissue\ncause my thoughts are dollar bill crisp\nDistinct like E-Double's lisp\nL.I. alumni, wonder why I got it\nGot it? Get a piece\nGot product that you all should own and not lease\nSome say drummers play synonymous with ill\nwith wordplay, that keep us all paid like a bill\nWe're the parent company\nYou the sub in my D-I-vision\nYou don't know how..\n",
