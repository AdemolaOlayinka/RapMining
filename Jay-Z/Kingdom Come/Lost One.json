My time in the army, it's served\nSo I have to allow she, her, time to serve\nThe time's now for her\nIn time she'll mature\nAnd maybe we, can be, we, again like we were\nFinally, my time's too short to share\nAnd to ask her now, it ain't fair\nSo yeah, she lost one\n\nLose one, let go to get one\nLeft one, lose some to win some (Oh yeah, she lost one)\nStory of a champion, sorry I'm a champion\nYou lost one\n\nMy nephew died in the car I bought\nSo I'm under the belief it's partly my fault\nClose my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought\nPlace any burden on me, but please, not that lord\nTime don't go back, it go forward\nCan't run from the pain, go towards it\nSome things can't be explained, what caused it?\nSuch a beautiful soul, so pure, shit\nGonna see you again, I'm sure of it\n'til that time, little man I'm nauseous\nYour girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift\nAlmost lost my faith, that restored it\nIt's like having your life restarted\nCan't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it\nSo now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift\nTo return, when I lost you, I lost it\n\nLose one, let go to get one\nLeft one, lose some to win some (Colleek, I lost one)\nSorry I'm a champion, Colleek, you're a champion\nYou lost one\n",
