    "lyrics": "Life is but a dream to me\nI don't wanna wake up\nThirty odd years without having my cake up\nSo I'm about my paper\n24/7, 365,366 in a leap year\nI don't know why we here\nSince we gotta be here\nLife is but a beach chair\nWent from having shabby clothes\nCrossing over Abbey Roads\nHear my angels singing to me\nAre you happy HOV?\nI just hope I'm hearing right\nKarma's got me fearing life\nColleek are you praying for me\nSee I got demons in my past\nSo I got daughters on the way\nIf the prophecy's correct\nThen the child should have to pay\nFor the sins of a father\nSo I barter my tomorrows\nAgainst my yesterdays\nIn hopes that she'll be OK\nAnd when I'm no longer here\nTo shade her face from the glare\nI'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter\nand a new beach chair\n\n\nLife is but a dream to me\nGun shots sing to these\nOther guys but lullabies\nDon't mean a thing to me\nI'm not afraid of dying\nI'm afraid of not trying\nEveryday hit every wave\nLike I'm Hawaiian\nI don't surf the net\nNo I never been on myspace\nToo busy letting my voice vibrate\nCarving out my space\nIn this world of fly girls\nCutthroats & diamond cut ropes I twirls\nBenzs round corners\nWhere the sun don't shine\nI let the wheels give a glimpse\nOf hope of one's grind\nSome said HOV, how you get so fly\nI said from not being afraid to fall out the sky\nMy physical's a shell\nSo when I say farewell\nMy soul will find an even\nHigher plane to dwell\nSo fly you shall\nSo have no fear, just know that\nLife is but a beach chair\n\n\nLife is but a dream Can't mimic my life\nI'm the thinnest cut slice\nIntercut, the winner's cup\nWith winters rough enough\nTO interrupt life\nThat's why I'm both\nThe saint & the sinner\nNice\nThis is Jay everyday\nNo compromise\nNo compass comes with this life\nJust eyes\nSo to map it out\nYou must look inside\nSure books can guide you\nBut your heart defines you\nChica\nYou corason is what brought us home\nIn great shape like Heidi Klum\nMaricon, I am on\nPermanent Vaca\nLife is but a beach chair\nThis song is like a Hallmark card\nUntil you read each here\nSo till she's here\nAnd she declared\nThe aire\nI will prepare\nA blueprint for you to print\nA map for you to get back\nA guide for your eyes\nAnd so you won't lose scent\nI'll make a stink for you to think\nI ink these verses full of prose\nSo you won't get conned out of 2 cent\nMy last will and testament I leave my heir\nMy share of Roc-AFella Records and a new beach chair\n",
