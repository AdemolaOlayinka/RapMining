I am.\nI'm feeling like the world's against me Lord\nCall me crazy but strangely I love the odds\n\n\n\n\n\nNow these baby ballers toy rappers\nCalling out my name to bring the boy backwards\nShooting air balls at the basket\nWhat you call money I paid more in taxes\nI got crowned King down in Africa\nDown in Nigeria do you have any idea\nSold out shows in Seoul Korea\nJo-berg, Dublin, Tanzania\nLunch with Mandela, dinner with Cavalli\nStill got time to give water out to everybody\nEverybody fall back\nY'all rapping I'm reenacting\nCNN you see it's accurate\nESPN see me in action\nMonday nights when the half ends\nWhen you ten years in holla back then\n",
