Shit I..\nparts with nothin, y'all be frontin\nMe give my heart to a woman?\nNot for nothin, never happen\nI'll be forever mackin\nHeart cold as assassins, I got no passion\nI got no patience\nAnd I hate waitin..\nHoe get yo' ass in\n\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah\n\nWe doin.. big pimpin, we spendin G's\nCheck em out now\nBig pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B\nYo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin G's\nWe doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B (b...)\n",
