(when I was young)\n\n\nI found myself reminiscin, remember this one\nwhen he was here he was crazy nice with his son\nI miss him, long as I'm livin he's livin through memories\nHe's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies\nIn heaven lookin over me, or in hell, keepin it cozy\nI'm comin life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be\nRemember Newton, mutual friend well me and him feudin\nOn your life I tried to talk to him\nBut you know niggaz, think they guns can stop foe niggaz\nFrontin like they're, Big Willie but really old niggaz\nHoe niggaz, this year I'm sho' niggaz think I'm slippin\nI'm bought to send you a roommate, no bullshittin\nfor my hustle's goin too well to hit him\nYou was right niggaz want you to be miserable wit em\nAnyway, I ain't tryin to hear it, I think I'm touched\nthis whole verse I been talkin to your spirit, a little too much\n\n\n\nRoc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A, Roc-A-Fella y'all\n",
