I ride witchu for free\nI want the longterm riches and bitches\nHave it all; now listen to me\nYou let them other niggaz get the name, skip the fame\nTen thou' or a hundred G keep yo' shit the same\nOn the low?\nYeah, the only way to blow\nYou let your shit bubble quietly\nAND THEN YOU BLOW!\nHey keep your cool\nThe only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand\nThen you play your cards\nThen he through dealin I understand\nDon't blow your dough on hotties\nThe only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts\nand won't break em for nobody!\nHah, I like resume, pick a day, you can start\nFrom now until death do us part...\n",
