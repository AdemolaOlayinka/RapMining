(Bigga)\nNigga, how you figure... (how you figure)\nYeah, yeah, yeah, aiyyo\n\nPeep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)\nThe number one question is can the Feds get us (uh-huh)\nI got vendettas in dice games against ass betters (uh-huh)\nand niggaz who pump wheels and drive Jettas\nTake that witcha..\n\n\n.. hit ya, back split ya\nFuck fist fights and lame scuffles\nPillow case to your face, make the shell muffle\nShoot your daughter in the calf muscle\nFuck a tussle, nickel-plated\nSprinkle coke on the floor, make it drug related\nMost hate it..\n\n\n.. can't fade it\nWhile y'all pump Willie, I run up in stunts silly\nScared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me\nBut on the contrilli, I packs the mack-milli\nSqueezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin soft on him\nWhat's ya name?\n\n\n.. Who shot ya? Mob ties like Sinatra\nPeruvians tried to do me in, I ain't paid them yet\nTryin to push 700's, they ain't made them yet\nRolex and bracelets is frostbit; rings too\nNiggaz 'round the way call me Igloo Stix (Who?)\nMotherfucker!\n\n\nJay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers\n(Where you from?) Brooklyn, goin out for all\nMarcy - that's right - you don't stop\nBed-Stuy.. you won't stop, nigga!\n\n\nWhat, what, what?\nJay-Z, Big' Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers\nBrooklyn represent y'all, hit you fold\nYou crazy, think your little bit of rhymes can play me?\nI'm from Marcy, I'm varsity, chump, you're JV\n(Jigga) Jay-Z\n\n\n.. and Bigga baby!\nMy Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious\nFuck three wishes, made my road to riches\nfrom 62's, gem stars, my moms dishes\nGram choppin, police van dockin\nD's at my doors knockin\n\n\nWhat? Keep rockin\nNo more, Mister, Nice Guy, I twist your shit\nthe fuck back with them pistols, blazin\nHot like cajun\nHotter than even holdin work at the Days Inn\nwith New York plates outside\nGet up outta there, fuck your ride\n\n\nKeep your hands high, shit gets steeper\nHere comes the Grim Reaper, Frank Wright\nLeave the keys to your In-tegra (That's right)\nChill homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me\nYou're holdin more drugs than a pharmacy, you ain't harmin me\nSo pardon me, pass the safe, before I blaze the place\nand here's six shots just in case\n(Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...)\n\n\nJay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers\n(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin out to all\n(Crown Heights...) You don't stop\n(Brownsville...)

You don't stop\n(Fort Greene...) You won't stop, niggaz!\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nFor nine six, the only MC with a flu\nYeah I rhyme sick, I be what you're tryin to do\nMade a fortune off Peru, extradite, china white heron\nNigga please, like short sleeves I bear arms\nStay out my way from here on (CLEAR?) Gone!\n\n\nMe and Gutter had two spots\nThe two for five dollar hits, the blue tops\nGotta go, Coolio mean it's gettin \"Too Hot\"\nIf Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two-Pac's\nGet it? .. Tu-pac's\n\n\nTime to separate the pros from the cons\nThe platinum from the bronze\nThat butter soft shit from that leather on the Fonz\nA S1 diamond from a eye class don\nA Cham' Dom' sipper from a Rosay nigga, huh?!\nBrook-Nam, sippin on\n\n\nCristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather\nThe M.A.F.I.A. keep canons in they Marc Buchanans\nUsually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow, tossin ya\nMad slugs through your Nautica, I'm warnin ya\n(Hah, what the fuck?)\n\n\nJay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit ya drawers\n(Where you from?)
