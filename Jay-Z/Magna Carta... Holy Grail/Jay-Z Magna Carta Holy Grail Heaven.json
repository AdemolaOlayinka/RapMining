And do you know how heaven taste?\nLie me down\n\nArm, leg, leg, arm, head - this is God body\nKnowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding - we just want our equality\nFood, clothing, shelter - help a nigga find some peace\nHappiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in the streets\nConspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati\nThey can't believe this much skill is in the human body\nHe's 6'2, how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?\nAw fuck it you got me\nQuestion religion, question it all\nQuestion existence until them questions are solved\nMeanwhile this heretic I be out in Marrakesh\nMorocco smoking hashish with my fellowship\nY'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo Yellow shit\nColor of Jello-O shit\nHello bitch, it's me again\nFresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and\n\nThat's me in the corner\nThat's me in the spotlight\nLosing my religion\n\nGetting ghost in the Ghost\nCan you see me?\nCan you see me?\nHave mercy on a Judas, angels wings on a 'ghini\nI'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down\nY'all religion creates division\nLike my Maybach partition n\nGod is my chauffeur\nBoy they loves Hova\nFrom the south side of Chi\nTo Brooklyn where I growed up I confess\nGod in the flesh\nLive among the serpents\nTurn arenas into churches\nI'm like Michael recycle, these are not 16s\nThese are verses from bible\nTell the preacher he's a preacher\nI'm a motherfucking prophet, smoke a tree of knowledge\nDrink from a gold chalice, you gotta love it\nI arrive at pearly gates, I had luggage\nMeaning I had baggage\nNiggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters\nOnly God could judge us, motherfuckers\n",
