Fuck naw\nWhere all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots\nAnd if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not\nI'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not\nlet outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot\nlet's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh\nLet's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh\nAnd sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy\nFlow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!\nYou know it's hell when I come through\nThe life and times of Shawn Carter\nnigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready\n\nIt's the hard knock life, for us\nIt's the hard knock life, for us!!\nSteada treated, we get tricked\nSteada kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!!\n\nI flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggaz\nlocked down in the ten by fo', controllin the house\nWe live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks\nBurn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that\nI flow for chicks wishin, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition\nI see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots\nAll my ballers that's born to clock\nNow I'ma be on top whether I perform or not\nI went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots\nto King Size, dream machines, the green fives\nI've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills\nThen I put it down type braile\nI'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies\nI'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!\nI'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin\nI'm tryin to murder everything movin, feel me?!\n\nIt's the hard knock life, for us\nIt's the hard knock life, for us!!\nSteada treated, we get tricked\nSteada kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life, for us\nIt's the hard knock life, for us!!\nSteada treated, we get tricked\nSteada kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!!\n\nI don't how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes\nGotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes\nHustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress\nyou'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me\nI gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out\nDidn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out\nSo I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out\nPut Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigguh!\n\nIt's the hard knock life, for us\nIt's the hard knock life, for us!!\nSteada treated, we get tricked\nSteada kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life, for us\nIt's the hard knock life, for us!!\nSteada treated, we get tricked\nSteada kisses, we get kicked\nIt's the hard knock life!!\n..
