    "lyrics": "Fuck -- shit is real right here\nRoc-a-Fella, LOX, takin the streets over motherfuckers\nDon't get it twisted\nYo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo\nYo shut the fuck up 'fore I blast and Banned From TV your ass\nwith no mask, look at the camera like what?\nYeah I did it like them sick white boys the court committed\nTo the death of me, I'm spaz like I'm on Ecstasy\nDrop 100 bars for real like I'm lookin for a deal\nIf I ain't hungry, who the fuck is, I'm worse than them African kids\nI ain't straight til my numbers match the Motorola ?bid?\nAnd walk the streets up in ? ? like I don't fuckin care\nIf I ain't strapped that means I took em off my Nike Airs\nGet off mine, y'all talk shit like little children\nwhen I ride mine like bitched when I walk up in the building\nCause I catch tans in the winter, with wild whores\nJet-skiin, while you keep warm at corner stores\nI make it hot, floodin your block, the best way\nProfessionally, they'll find poison in your X-Ray\nAs I get roasted lookin at Biggie posted on my wall\nTakin shots of Louie til I fall\nNuttin to lose, just load the clip up in the groove\nand kick rhymes to the poster, til I swear Big move\nMy team, you would think was on Thorazine\nHow we floss and don't give a fuck what it's cost-ing\n\nYo, yo, pressure bust pipes, it's time to apply it now\nPick out a quiet town and tie it down\nMake niggaz lock it down, y'all know where to buy it now\nBeanie Mac I supply it now\nMy squad roll deep, in foreign cars with two seats\nCouple of 5's, a 6, a few Jeeps\nBag enough coke to last a few weeks\nIn case niggaz wanna test, vest and a few heats\nYou really wanna test my name? And test my game?\nUntil you have me, test my aim?\nY'all niggaz nuts, like testricles\nHit you up in your apartment buildin vestibule\nPerhaps it's best for you, to keep on walkin\nHeat from the noggin, keep on sparkin\nPlatinum prezzie, Bezzie, stay sparklin\nCop off the lot never see me at the auction\nPint of Bacardi darken, when it's hawkin\nOut on the strip, until I reach the margin\nNot tryin to meet the Seargeant, at the precinct\nEatin cheese sandwiches, down for the weekend\nLocked up with dirty white boys and Ricans\n\nNow if I kill you I probably do ten in the box\nCome down on appeal then I'm killin your pops\nYou feelin The LOX, nigga why you grillin The LOX\nIf this rap shit don't work niggaz still in the spot\nYou bring it to me, I gotta lose your family\nGangstas don't die, they get chubby, and move to Miami\nShit is deep now dog but it gets deeper\nFuck it, the weather's nice and the price is much cheaper\nI put it on tape, you gon' buy it, I put it in a bag\nyou gon' try it, y'all niggaz can't deny it\nLot of cats still tryin to study my last bounce\nTell you what, get a beat tape and a half ounce\nThey got me where I can't be without my large gat\nTeflon long sleeve, and my hardhat\nDon't matter if I'm openin up, or headline\nDoin the speed limit or pushin red lines\nSix months in the county or fed time\nI'ma be the 'Kiss nigga, until it's bedtime\nAnything I'm on is a classic, any nigga\never had beef with, son is a bastard\nAnytime I spit, spit acid, L.O.X.\nRuffryder you heard? We got the game mastered\nI told you the pain was comin\nYou wouldn't listen\nYou tried to play me like a joke?\nNow who got the last laugh?\nNow take these bullets with you to hell\n\nYou motherfuckers is sick, don't think Sauce the shit\nSo many niggaz on my nuts I thought I lost my dick\nPicture me fallin off, I'm camera shy\nHammers fly, might miss you, but your man'll die\nWhat's the difference? Either way I'm stunnin your crew\nI fuck to win, y'all niggaz comin to lose\nSomethin to prove? Spit it, we can have a sprayoff\nI lay off wet niggaz and kill em on my day off\nAin't nuttin for me to bust a trey off\nMurder the whole month of April nigga, just to take May off\nRun with more Germans than Adolf, you light crews\nNow I concentrate on your camp, like Jews\nFlow hot like a heatwave bitch\nWhips fatter than them shits they beat slaves with\nI'm a meal stackin nigga who pull quick, still packin\nfor you Phil Jackson niggaz on that Bull\n\nI don't give a FUCK who you are, so FUCK who you are\nI don't care about a pretty bitch, watch or a car\nI don't care about your block and whoever you shot\nI don't care about your album and whenever it drop\nI don't care about your past if I did I woulda asked\nI'm too busy lightin 'dro with a whole lotta hash\nFar as this rap shit, I'm ten steps ahead of niggaz\nShootin backwards, just for practice\nRide or die nigga, hoppin in your casket\nBout to go to hell with you, blow the L with you\nTell the whole world I'm spittin let em know the shells hit you\nI tell niggaz quick, suck dick and get a glock\nMy name ring bells like Sunday at twelve o'clock\nI'm half past seven, bust six then eleven\nYou know me, slide my man my joint say reload me\nI ruffryde and pop a fella for Roc-a-Fella\nJay (what the fuck) spendin mozzarella\n\nI know pop you can't stand us cause you cock them hammers\nRun in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma\nLocked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta\nCrossed up in a drop I popped up the antenna\nWhoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like scanners\nLike raindrops you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon\nBig thang, big chains, ain't shit changed\nGet brained in the four dot six Range\nShit main, switch lanes\nevery town I hit, switch planes, bitch flipped big caine\nFlow with no cut, you take it in vain/vein to the brain\nMuh'fukas is noddin and throwin up, you know that\nYou don't wanna owe that man\nHe'll hit you, get the picture? Kodak man\nGotta, love for war, I don't floss no more\nI just sit on my money til I'm above the law\nHow the fuck you gonna stop us with your measly asses\nWe don't stop at the tolls we got EZ passes, nigga\nMultiple cars and divas with D-classes\nIceberg sweat with I.B. on the elastic\nShit, beyotch! What the fuck, ya heard me?\nPut some more beat on that joint\n",
