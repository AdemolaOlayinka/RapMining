Uh)\nGreyhound bitch, stay down bitch\nBout to set up shop with Jay, round this bitch\nHalf a brick of yea, bout to lay down this bitch\n(til November?) Nah, I'm here to like slay down this bitch\nWhat you think? I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch\nCall my whole team, from around the way down this bitch\nI'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch\nHad a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six\nRoll the windows down and, weight round this bitch\nBut there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch\nGotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here\nfor all to get the paydays, first I line up all the haters\nI got jobs for ya, drop stars for ya\nMore arms than Green Bay's Brett Favre for ya\nMoney providentials hope that's not a problem for ya\nIf so, Jigga be here, day after tomorrow for ya (That's right!)\n\nGotta get that paper dog\nGotta touch that, love that, paper dog, uhh!\nGotta get that paper dog\nGotta have that grab that paper dog!\nGotta get that paper dog\nGotta spend that, bend that, split that, get that\nGotta get that paper dog\nWhen I needs that, G stack, tell me where the weed's at?\n\nI got my two guns, I came to scoop ones\nA down ass bitch and she down to click\nGot a nice little hooptie that I get around with\nAnd my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich\nGotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit\nTell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch\nSee I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit\nNot to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit\nReturn later that evening in the club with Fox\nAnd I got the snub nosed for those that love to box\nI'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block\nall day, til it's like gray outside\nShoot dice talkin shit all day outside\nAnd even when it's hot, they outside\nLet em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde\nAnd aiyyo, you will want me on your side\n\n\nYo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best\nI ain't got it to give but I got it to test\nAnd if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest\nis your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less\nFor the next couple of days I brought her all I posess\nThe Rolex, necklaces with the VVS\nTwin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest\nFor my top draft picks I cop the new GS\nNow all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team\nCause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream\nPicked em up in the afternoons and told em some things\nYou know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens\nYo, never lay your head where you holdin them things\nFrom family, to your business, nothing goes in between\nNever feared no man, put four in his Beem\nDrop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?\n",
