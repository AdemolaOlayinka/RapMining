D's, niggaz mad, veins out\nCopped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out\nFlashy, fly little nigga\nNosy bitch from the third floor like \"Why little nigga?\"\nBitch please, twist the trees\nTook a long pull, like bitch to breathe\nThat's my answer, life's like cancer\nAnd I'm serious\n\n\"Waitin for my day to come\"\n\"Just give me the word\"\n",
