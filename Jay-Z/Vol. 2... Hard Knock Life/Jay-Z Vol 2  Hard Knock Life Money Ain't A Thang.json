The chain'll strain ya eye\nTwin platinum gun son, aim for the sky\nIce on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it\nWillies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young\nSee me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up\nMine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'\nDamn near out the rear trunk when I roll up\nMulti til I close up, it's all basic\nI been spending hundreds since they had small faces\nRob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas\nMe and Jermaine Dupri got it locked crazy\nWhere you at haters?\n\n\nMy cake thick, I live the life\nEatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night\nI make the big moves, do the big things\nTake small groups, turn them into big names\nThe big dog with the big chain, frost bit bracelet to match\nCats say I'm the shit man\nThe type of nigga that you need in yo' crew\nType of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do\nGet more burnt than a candle\nToo hot to hold, too much to handle\nIn the black C-low, he know if she look\nShe go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no more\nI'm the truth like A.I., got the proof and stay fly\nIn the safest shit you could never buy\nKnow why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing\nI don't know bout y'all but every night I swing\n\n\nYa'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'\nAnd ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill\nSaid she loved my necklace, started relaxin\nNow that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction\nWent from wholesome to Jigga, you owed some\nBaby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey\nPlatinum, spend your whole life in the day\nWhat's down is a bet, roll the dice\n\nYeah, yeah, so let's play\nSo what, you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel\nIt's gonna take a lot more to see my level\nWhere I'm at, your check, you better double that\nAnd personally your raps is where the trouble at\nI'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain\nIn the platinum frame screaming it's not a game\nGleaming, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain\nEven me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy\n\nSo So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo'\nYou know, all we do is rock\nRock on\n",
