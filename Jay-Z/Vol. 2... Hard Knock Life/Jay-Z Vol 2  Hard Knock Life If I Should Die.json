Blige my niggas\nI've eluded the coppers got booted with Big Poppa\nSkated through with the Ceasar Picadas\nAt high school got head by the lockers\ngassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers\nrocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail\nrhymes still written well hold court in the street\nnever sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail\nshoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck\nsittin' in the county for summers if they should down me\neverybody around us become one for that day\nto live life get your shit right & play\nDon't get it twisted like rays if I miss that's ok\nbut life's short don't miss a day uhh\n\nIf I should die don't cry my niggas\njust ride my niggas bust bullets in the sky my niggas\nand when I'm gone don't mourn my niggas\nget on my niggas when it's real\nsay word to Shawn my niggas\nIf I should die...\n\n\n...don't cry my niggas\nit's been one hell of a ride my niggas\nsay word to Wais my niggas\nwhen I'm gone don't mourn my niggas\njust keep gettin' it on my niggas\nsay word is bond my niggas\n\nI got a lot to look back on in '88\ngot my crack on ten years later gettin' my rap on\ngettin' shorties like a thespian\nhad an episode with two lesbians got a fetish for that\ndrunk ginseng with Japanese chicks & pulled the root out\nsqueeze my whole clip to survive shootouts\nbeen on both coasts fired all kinds of heat\nprobably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets\nI got dead mens to meet and questions to fulfill\nlike is that mystery God real?\nand how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad\nI must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas\nwith Latifah broke the code of Geneva\nI know when I reach the other side I'ma see the\ncat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker\nthen it's on again if I could be born again\nI live my life through my son\nand tell him never have a friend\njust family reincarnated I'll show him the time\nthat I waited to get paid tell him never be afraid\nniggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo blood run thicker\nnever shed tears cry liquor my nigga\n\nIf I die don't cry my niggas\nit's been one hell of a ride my niggas\nsay word to Wais my niggas\nwhen I'm gone don't mourn my niggas\njust keep bangin' these songs my niggas\nsay word is bond my niggas\nIf I die...\n\n\n...don't cry my niggas\njust stay gettin' high my niggas\ndon't wonder why my niggas\nwhen I'm gone live on my niggas\njust follow my path my niggas\nsay word to Half my nigga\n\nI'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone\nborn to live forever through life's struggles\nI cut corners & took drastic measures\nsee you niggas life expire right in front of me\ntime could never mend what these cold streets\nmentally done to me too often I close my eyes\nand see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave\nthis world that I'm lost in my only chance\nto see the seeds I lost through abortion\nwhen I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn\nkeep flossin' as long as my name\nlives on what's most important\nI'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life\nafterlife still torchin' & blazin' these mics\nIt'd rain for 40 days & 40 nights\n& I'd return on the 3rd like Christ\nwithout my physical portion\nmy spirit a poltergeist for sure\nI'll be back through the heist tomorrow\nblood over y'all fake niggas door\nWhat you thought? (huh)\nWhat you thought? (nigga)\n\nIf I should die don't cry my niggas\njust stay gettin' high my niggas\ndon't wonder why my niggas\nwhen I'm gone live on my niggas\njust follow my path my niggas\nsay word to Half my nigga\nWhen I die...\n",
