Cause I'm like that yo !\n\nAs a young and dumb man, gun in the waist\nSold crack to those who couldn't take the pain\nAnd had to numb it with baste\nCouldn't drink the henny straight, I needed somethin to chase\nI needed something to chase\nNowadays I throw shots back,leavin nothin to waste\nLife is like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place\nGettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past\n> I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin\nRock hot lenin, cop hot cars and hot women\nIf it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not remembering,\nMy motto is simply I will not lose, abide by the block rules,\nI buy my glock used, wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it ?\nI'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood,\nIf you ain't live like I live then run with the hood\nI done what i could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still\nRun with the hood, guess it's part of my nature, if hell awaits ya ?\nNigga I'm coming with the razors, still flashin ya shit\nTry to pass me in a six, tight classy on the wrist\nEvery bit of 30 karats, this is not a game\nThis isn't why I came, make these words find a spot on your brain\nAnd burn, then I recycle my life\nI shall return\n\n\nHow tight is your flow ?\n\nCause I'm like that yo !\n\nHow right is your dough ?\n\nCause I'm like that yo !\n\nHow white is your blow ?\n\nCause I'm like that yo !\n\nOnly writers you know\n\nCause I'm like that\n\nI'm a hop, skip, a jump, from rippin the pump\nSpittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump\nShit, I get digits in lumps, I'm a motherfucking problem is this what you want\n?\nOverachiever, I love chicks that puff chiva,\nAnd reefer paper, I hate the one's that blow up ya beeper\nCause I, go in ya deeper, I only bone divas\nInpregnate the world when I \"cum\" through your speakers (ha ha)\nFuck hot my records got the fever\nNiggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up\nI creep up when the beef heats up, caught him with his feet up\nAnd shoes off, bout to snooze off\nHatin, cause you can't turn the booze off\nYou dudes is too soft, when I fuck with you all\nI might bark your ex, and spit at the locks\nBut, other than that I ain't even fucking with cats\nJust me tied B.I., thug it like that, me,dame and biggs\nWhat's fuckin with that ?\nY'all can never diss Jigga, get nothing for that\nOther then a couple slugs in ya back,\nRappers y'all runnin around, like I won't gun ya down\nLast nigga that fronted, two spun him around\nLord, except this offer here's somethin for your crown\nI admit no malice, I just met his challenge, In one\n\n\nGirls and guns, all i want\nstock exchange, rocks and thangs\n",
