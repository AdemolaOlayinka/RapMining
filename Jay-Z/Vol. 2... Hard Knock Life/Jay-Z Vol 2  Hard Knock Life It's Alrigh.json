It's Alright, yeah yeah\nI need a ho in my life to blow on my dice\nSo we can make our points twice and skate out a town\nI need that glow in my ice, E-Class\nLadies screamin Jigga you know we ease that, flowin out like Jees-ass\nJay-Z and me holdin the mic\nso when you like you find MC's so impolite\nAnd me I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner like\nDon't me and Jigga be flowin alike?\nNah, Not in your life ain't nobody copin like\nMr. Jay-Z, shit you're crazy\nI'm hot like the six maybe, Deep dish with the great seats\nI flow greater than you're navigator\nI drop in you're town, block you're data\nPimps all comin through with a hot pair of gators\nAnd a crew with rocks the size of craters\nCan't touch like hot potatoes, Ya Heard?\nBounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball\nPlay if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss\nIt's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back\nGet ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke\nKill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc\nIt's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, Holla back\n\nIn the middle of a war rockin a vest\nWho's the illest shorty alive, I confess\nI take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's, I bless\nThe mics until the day I rest, till they can feel what I feel\nI'ma try my best, and if you real like I real\nyou can provide the rest\nAnything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the heart\nI'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out\nAny nigga realer than me, is in a messhall with their chest out\nAny rapper with less clout, sell more records than me\nWe extort them as soon as they record 'em, Bleek\nMy name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair\nOn the project stairs, Once I drop to a ceaser Ma I don't need ya\nFrom the block to the hot two-seaters\n\nBounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball\nPlay if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss\nIt's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back\nGet ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke\nKill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc\nIt's Alright, you heard? It's Alright, Check\nOn the two Jew-el's I blew more money than Latrell, who else?\nThey don't know you, think they know you too well, you jell\nLike Flubber I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set\nPress you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate, Mr. I don't cop nothin\nLess than eight, and anything involved with my name\nRegardless of the fame\nIt's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again,\nCharge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express\nMy boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress\nTo make every jam tougher, you ain't my man fuck ya\nI suggest let you live right? Negative, I swear\nIt's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife\nClose you're casket tight\nTake you're last two deep breaths and pass the mic\nTo Jay-Z nigga, That's Right!!\nBounce if you wanna bounce, ball if you wanna ball\nPlay if you wanna play, floss if you wanna floss\nIt's Alright, you heard?, It's Alright, Holla back\nGet ill if you wanna ill, smoke if you wanna smoke\nKill if you wanna kill, loc if you wanna loc\nIt's Alright, you heard? It's Alright\n",
