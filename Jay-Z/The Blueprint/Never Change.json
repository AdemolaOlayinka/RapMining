Welcome home to Taj\nLet no amount of money ruin this thing of ours\nWe run streets like drunks run street lights\nWe collidin with life as we speak\nWe knee deep in coke, we ki deep in ice\nWe flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke\nWe all fish, better teach your folk\nGive him money to eat, then next week he's broke\nCause when you sleep, he's reachin for your throat\nWord on the skreet, you reap what you sew\nNot out of fear but love, love for the game\nRoc family first, we never change mayn\n\n\n(\"Never, never, never, never change\")\nI'm still fuckin with crime cause crime pays\n(\"I never change!\")\nOut hustlin, same clothes for days\n(\"I never change!\")\nI never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I never change\nWho you know like Hov'?\n(\"Never, never, never, never change\")\nI'm still fuckin with crime cause crime pays\n(\"I never change!\")\nOut hustlin, same clothes for days\n(\"I never change!\")\nI never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I never change\n\n\nWhat's up to my Miami and St. Thomas connects (whattup)\nI'll never mention your name, I promise respect\nDeath before dishonor correct? - Yup\nThat's what you promised me, since the (?)lee\nAlong with, if we stay strong\nWe can get paper longer than Pippen's arms\nPlead the fifth when it comes to the fam\nI'm like a dog - I never speak, but I understand\nWhere my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war?\nWhere your bars at? Whoa, gotta pause that - whoa\nLost 92 bricks had to fall back\nKnocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back\nHad A-1 credit, got more crack\nFrom the first to the fifth, gave it all back\nIf, I'm not a hustler what you call that?\nThis is before rap, this is all fact\nI never change\n\n\n\n\nWhat, the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly\nWell fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari\nWas so young my big sis' still playin with Barbie\nYoung brother, big city, eight million stories\nOld heads taught me, yung'un, walk softly\nCarry a big clip, that'll get niggaz off me\nKeep coke in coffee, keep money smellin mothy\nChange is cool to cop but more important is lawyer fees\n(Uhh) That's how it is now (uhh) that's how it always be\n(Uhh) I never change, this is always me\nFrom the womb to the tomb, from now until my doom\nDrink army from one cup pass it around the room (That's a family nigga)\nThat's the ritual (yup) Big Ran, I ain't forget you fool\nAnd all that bullshit you tryin to get through\nThis is crew love, move music or move drugs\nRival crews get your black suits up - I never change\n\n\n\n\nThis is Jay, everyday\nWho you know like Hov', nigga?\n",
