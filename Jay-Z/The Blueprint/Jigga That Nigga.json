R.O.C. niggaz\nJay-Z..\n\n\nCome on the track duh duh da-da\nWith a throwback jersey and a fitted\nMight blow a bag of hershey in the sidd-ix\nOr might take sips of army with a chidd-ick, I'm so sick widdit\nLampin in the Hamptons, the weekends man\nThe Stan Smith Adidas and the Campers\nOr playin guts on the cruise, Hermes bow shoes\nThe Izod bucket on I'm so old school\nYellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops\nSix top model chicks, who is this hot?\nJ-A, ladies help me say it now\nY-Z, mami why you playin with me?\nRide with me, get high as me\nIt's how it's supposed to be, when you rollin with G's, Hov'!\nBack up in this bitch like whoa\nJigga get this whole bitch jumpin like six-fo's\n\n\n(Hov'!) V is I, and I am him\n(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)\nSlim with the tilted brim on twenty inch rims\n(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)\nAnd if y'all got love for me I got love for y'all\n(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)\nAnd if y'all go to war for me I go to war wit y'all\n(Jigga, Jigga, that nigga Jigga!)\n\n\nHov'! And so I breeze through, jeans is Evisu\nShe's respondin, top of C. Bronson\nWe in Luan (whoo!) gettin our groove on\nBuyin out the bar, on our way to Spa'\nShe never seen a hundred on the wrist before\nNever seen twenty-two's on the 6 before\nI am, killin 'em out there, they needin first aid\nCause the boy got more 6's than first grade\nThe crib got, killer views and square feet\nYou have to film MTV Cribs for a week\nSo, sleep if you need to, mami I will leave you\nRight where you stand, nah I don't wanna dance (I'm good)\nI just wanna see what's in your Frankie V pants\nWaist is low enough to let your waist show\nTop like a rock star, I got a fast car\nWe can cruise the city, doin a buck-sixty\n\n\n\n\n\"He did it again!\" Haters no like\nBut they gotta fuck with it cause the flow's so tight\nGnarly dude! I puff Bob Marley dude\nAll day, like Rastafari's do\nNow I'm stuck to the point I could hardly move\nYou fuckin up my high, don't bother me dude\nBut Red Rover, send your hoes over\nShe can do WHATEVER, sip somethin with soda\nShe can leave WHENEVER, sip somethin with Hova\nWe can play HOWEVER, slay bed or sofa\nAnd the prognosis, sex is explosive\nLeft her with wet bedsheets, nigga I'm focused\n\n\n\n\nR.O., R.O.C. niggaz..\nR.O.C. niggaz\n(Roc-A-Fella y'all!)\n",
