    "lyrics": "Motherfuckers -\nsay that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)\nDo you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?\nSee I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined\nThat same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin\nwhat I do through and through and\nI give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view\nThe renegade; you been afraid\nI penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they\npop toasters, and they live with they moms\nGot dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over\nMommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over\nKnocked down by some clown when child support knocked\nNo he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down\nI bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round\nhidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways\nJust read a magazine that fucked up my day\nHow you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?\nI help them see they way through it - not you\nCan't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes\nBet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt\n\nSince I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen\nI ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute\nCause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it\nBut if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it\nNow who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics\nWho could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics\nusin his music to steer it sharin his views in his marriage\nBut there's a huge interference - they're sayin you shouldn't hear it\nMaybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit\nMaybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish\nBut I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America\nas a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?\nNow now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror\nand see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased\nAnd I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents\nYou fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!\n(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't\nthink you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo\nCause here we go - he's {*Jigga joint Jigga-chk-Jigga*}\nAnd I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the\n\nRENEGADE! Never been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk\nabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!\nNever been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a {RENEGADE} Never been afraid to holler\nabout anything {anything?} Anything {ANYTHING!}\n\nI had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles\nPockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent\nGotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench\nWhatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in\nBy the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver\nDoo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope\nDo not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often\nMy pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home\nCould not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights\nI brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings\nMy demeanor - thirty years my senior\nMy childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up\nRaisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky\nBig I did it - multi before I die (nigga)\nNo lie, just know I chose my own fate\nI drove by the fork in the road and went straight\n\nSee I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare\nJesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here\nTo shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me\nas a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist\nBut that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste\nWe as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is\nOr is he the latter - a gateway to escape?\nMedia scapegoat, who they can be mad at today\nSee it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie\nwhile I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me\nGo to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics\nin holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer\nI'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful\nThe new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you\nWhat did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter\nmakin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin\n",
