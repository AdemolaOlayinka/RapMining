Because I'm grubbing more\nand I pack heat like I'm the oven door?\nNiggas pray and pray on my downfall\nBut everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball\nNow I don't wanna have to kill southpaw\nDon't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar\nLook scrapper I got nephews to look after\nI'm not looking at you dudes, I'm looking past you\nI thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper\nCan I live? I told you in ninety-six\nthat I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz\nI scramble like Randall with his\nCunningham but the only thing running is numbers fam\nJigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?\n\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..\"\nNiggas, where's the love?\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of town..\"\nHolla at me!!\n\"Ain't no love\" (take 'em to church) \"in the heart of the city..\"\nUh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love?\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of town..\"\nFuck\n\nThen Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up\nThen I wake up to more bullshit\nYou knew me before records, you never disrespected me\nNow that I'm successful you'll pull this shit\nNigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss\nLet's end the speculation, I'm talking to all you\nMales shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait\nWatch you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?\nYou all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place\nHehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?\nNigga respect the game, that should be it\nWhat you eat don't make me shit - where's the love?\n\nWhere's the love?\n\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..\"\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of town..\"\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..\"\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of town..\"\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..\"\n\"Ain't no love, in the heart of town..\"\n\n\"Ain't no love..\"\n",
