We always hook up when we out\nWe do what we like to do and then we out\nBut lately I've been havin the strangest feelings\nYour boy Young Hov' catchin feelings\nand it's messin up my dealings cause mami's not willin\nto leave her boyfriend, she call me her toy-friend\nSaid, \"We was just 'sposed to hook up and have a glass\"\nShe called me her emergency dick-in-the-glass\nHehehe.. I had to laugh for a second\nHad to check myself, get my mackin back in perspective\nI slack for a second but I'm back, no question\nLike I walk with a cane, ain't no half-steppin!\n... Jeah, and on that note\nIceberg Slim is back to rock a boat, c'mon!\n\n\n\nLet's just - fuck all night! Yeah\nUntil we both start yawnin\nYeah\nTo the bright Shirley Murdock mornin\nYeah\nUntil we both start yawnin\nLet's just - fuck all night!
