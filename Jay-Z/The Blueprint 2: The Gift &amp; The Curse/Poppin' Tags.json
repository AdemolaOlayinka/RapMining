Go ahead and treat yourself\nWhen you come up on some cheddar better pop that tag\nLike when I dip off in the Prada then I go off\nto the lot lay the paper down and cop that Jag\nI got a console full of ammunition and funds\nMink Roc-a-Wear and some guns\nPetty in a fresh pair of jumps, blo-packs and Bo Jax\nand Air Maxes, throw back some ones, no max for none\n(When I go up in the store a nigga never get enough)\nI'm a baller and if you want it come and get it now\n(Nigga come to a race with a car you won't catch up)\nAnd the Twista kinda wicked when I spit it now\nI be choppin up cheddar with Kanye\nChop a little cheddar up with Jay\nChop it up with the O-to-the-Kizay\nPoppin big tags with the flow and the dough, we get bi-zay!\n\n\n\n\nUh-huh, what's up? Tell you something about me..\nMy throwback game is whiffle wicked\nSaint Patties day, green pinstripe, number 20 Mark Spitz'n\nJersey ooh-wee with the matchin Nu*Wear fitted\nWhite boys say my style is bitchin\nKeeping coke in the kitchen\nKeep a glock that will shock and bring the rest\ntucked underneath my Mitchell and Ness\nI, travelling, handling with a forty-five cannon\nIt's tucked in my Marc Buchanan\nExtra clips and shells in the lambskin\nTwo deep by Pelle Pelle\nWestside how they felly fell\nMore G's on me, than a late 80's Gucci leather\nworn by the great Rakim himself\nStitch my Dapper Dan oh man with the gun in hand\nI leave your blood squirting\nNo offense, I'll put your face on the chest\nof a sweatshirt drawn by Shirt Kings\nI been fucking, a hustle, married to a racket\nsince the first Air Jordan's and Starter jackets\nI slept with a package, under mattress\nI carry guns heavy speakeasy, slight with the fight words\nI'll put something hot through your motherfucking iceberg\nGot a project chica, named Rica\nShe keep a purse full of dro' reefer\nSmall, pinkies like that\nTalk 'til the paper fat\nI rock somethin, roll chief +Sacks+ like Daddy Fat!\n\n\n\n\nPop tires in reverse, you'll be needin a nurse\nLeave you laying on your back in a Cadillac hearse\nNow your momma in all black with a matchin purse\nI know you wanna blow up, but a funeral hurts\nWhat's worse, you can hit the mall and ball 'til you fall\nHave to make a collect call, but your cell cut off\nTrot to the mailbox thinkin a check but the mail's run short\nNo more MD, DD, LD\nThat means Movie Date, Dinner Date, Lunch Date, help me please\nMy sheets is gone\nLong bread to the short bread, word is bond\nMeticulously pompously serve the song\nAct a damn donkey\nLike the pilgrims when they popped a tag on the Indians home\nDrop top rag-o with the weed gone\nChilling, bags in the trunk full of FAO Schwartz for the chill'uns\nSpent a few shillings\nSip a few chickens, lick a few kittens, just kidding\nA fresh bowl of milk is in the fridge and\nCan you pop the tags on the honeycombs\nOr are you acting mad cause the money done\nslowed, down, just a little bit\nDipped, poked out, did some shull-bit\nActing like a pitfall bull-pit\nDead game is the pul-pit\nLeave a motherpumper with his John Doe toe tag clipped\nImperial classic, a lyrical thrashing\nA miracle happening\nJay-Z, Killer Mike and Big Boi rappin and rhyming and smabbin\nPop that tag on some of this game\nHolla-tic, swallow and keep the change\n",
