I gotcha\n\nLet's take a trip down memory, lane at the cemetery\nRain grey skies, seems at the end of every\nyoung black life is this line, \"Damn - him already?\nSuch a good kid,\" got us pouring Henn' already\nLiquor to the curb for my, niggas up above\nWhen it, cracks through the pavement that's my way of sendin love\nSo, give Big a hug, tell Aa-liyah I said hi\n'Til the next time I see her, on the other side\nHe was just some thug that, caught some slugs\nAnd we loved him cause, in him we, saw some of us\nHe walked like us, talked like us\nHis back against the wall, nigga fought like us - damn\nPoor Isis, that's his momma name\nMomma ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?\nShorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him\nHot temper, momma said he act just like her husband\nDaddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him\nIsis blaming herself, she wish she could've saved him\nDamn near impossible, only men can raise men\nHe was his own man, not even him can save him\nHe put his faith in a, thirty-eight in his waist\nBut when you live by the gun you die by the same fate\nEnd up, dead before thirty-eight and umm\nThat's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world\nOld girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away\nIsis, life just, ended on that rainy day\nWhen she got the news her boy body could be viewed\ndown at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude\nHer addiction grew, prescription drugs, shift and brew\nAngel dust, dipped in WOO!\nShe slipped into, her own fantasy world\nHad herself pregnant by a different dude\nBut reality bites and, this is her life\nHe wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife\nIt was just this night when, moon was full\nAnd the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight\nHad her sounding like Lisa Lisa - I wonder if I take you home\nwill you still love me after this night?\nMike was the hardhead from the around the way\nthat she wanted all her life, shit she wanted all the hype\nUsed to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike\nHe was a Willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like\nIt was a, dude named Shy who would really treat her right\nHe wanted to run to the country to escape the city life\nBut I-sis, like this, Broadway life\nShe loved the Gucci sneakers, the red green and whites\nHangin out the window when she first seen him fight\nShe was so turned on that she had to shower twice\nHow ironic it would, be some fight that\nturned into a homicide that'll alter their life\nSee Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene\nHad a son fifteen that he never saw twice\nSure he saw him as an infant, but he dissed on him like\n\"If that was my son, he would look much different.\nSee I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark\nso it's, momma's baby; poppa's maybe.\"\nMike was still crazy out there running the streets (fuck niggas want?)\nHad his old reliable with thirty-eight gun in his reach\nIt's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak\nHe running around like life's a peach, 'til one day\nhe approached this thug that, had a mean mug\nAnd it looked so familiar that he called him \"Young Cuz\"\nTold him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you)\nInstead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub\nHe clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up)\nThere was somethin in this man's face he knew he seen before\nIt's like, lookin in the mirror seeing hisself more mature\nAnd he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord\nYou know what they say about he who hesitates in war\n(What's that?) He who hesitates is lost\nHe can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank\nThe old man didn't think he just followed his instinct\nSix shots into his kid, out of the gun\nNiggas be a father, you're Killing your son\nSix shots into his kid, out of the gun\nNiggas be a father, you Killing your sons\n\nMeet the parents..\n",
