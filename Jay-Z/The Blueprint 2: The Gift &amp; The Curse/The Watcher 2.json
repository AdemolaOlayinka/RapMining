(watcher)\nOkay, let's do this (the watcher)\n\n\nThings just ain't the same for gangsters\nBut I'm a little too famous to shoot these pranksters\nAll of these rap singers claimin they bangers\nDoin all sorts of twisted shit with they fingers\nDisrespectin the game, no home trainin or manners\nI was doin this shit when you was shittin Pampers\nI was movin them grams 'fore you, knew what a hand that hand was\nDuckin the vans, radars, the scanners\n'Fore you knew what hard white to tame was\nI was hittin the turnpike, aight with the bammers\nI was nice with my hands, cuss aight with them hammers\nI was prickin my finger 'fore you knew what a Fam was\nI had it laid out 'fore you knew what a plan was\nThree hundred mill' later, now you understand us\nY'all ain't see us comin through Vegas\nYou ever seen so much cham' bust in one night\nGrand fucked up one fight\nI was on the Peter Pan bus\nYou was Peter Pan up in your room, y'all fuckin with whom?\nAllowed me to be taught\nYou cowards is just now learnin the shit that we talk\nYou niggaz ain't know about a Robb Report\nBout a high speed Porsche, i.e.\nYou niggaz ain't know how to floss 'til I came through the door\nlike \"Eric B. for Pres,\" respect me in this BITCH!\nYou can't disrespect us cause you got a little check cut\nYou was suckin for so long, fuckin your little neck up\nNow you too big for your britches, you got a few little bitches\nYou think you Hugh Hefner, you just ridiculous\nI blew breath for you midgets, I gave life to the game\nIt's only right I got the right to be king\nNiggaz that got life really like what I sing\nCause they know is he really like, niggaz feel my pain\nKnow the shit I DON'T write be the illest shit that's ever been recited\nin the game word to the hyphen in my NAME!\nJ, A, Y, DASH, Hoffa\nThe past present nigga the future, proper\nThe holy trinity of hip-hop is us\nWe give, Dre his props BUT that's where it stops\nIt's the Roc\n\n\nI know, you got your eyes on me\nI feel you watchin me\nBut it ain't hard to see that you can't see me\nYou try, but what you think you saw\nAin't what you thought you saw\nYou bed-da off not lookin at all\n(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as befo')\n(People I used to know, just don't know me no mo')\n(But everywhere that I go, I got people I know)\n(Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)\n\n\nI'm still on top of the game\nStill droppin flames, still cock and aim\nStill at the top had the Roc for the fame\nover setbacks, there's been a lot since I came\nYou seen it all, how I got, how I gained\nThe momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain\nWhen I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim\nthe streets, they made a special spot for my name\nDre, haters wanna stop to my reign\nBut the music lives in me, every drop in my veins\nThe pride and the pain\nAll the way back from the rise of my name\nSee the world clear through the eyes of the mane\nSee the world chear for the rhymes that I gave\nWhen the beat bangs it'll drive them insane\nThe eyes that I played\nThe best to emerge in the game is The Watcher\n\n\n\n\nI'm \"Rated R,\" my brain contains graphics thangs\nIt turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends\nIt's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen\nWhich means, I can see the whole planet in the scene\nCash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket\nSome take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it\ntake away the added profit, it's catastrophic\nI take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it\nThese New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully\nThe world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me\nYo, my neighborhood is never sunny\nIn the place where the number one cause of death is money\nYou can try copin\nI've seen enough shit to leave your frame of mind broken\nI'm still alive and scopin\nBe another hundred years 'til my skies close in\nAnd I'ma die with my eyes open, the watcher\n",
