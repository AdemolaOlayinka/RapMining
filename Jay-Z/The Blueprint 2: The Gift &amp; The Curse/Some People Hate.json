This must be the way the nigga 'Pac felt when he made\n\"Me Against the World,\" \"All Eyez on Me\"\nY'all niggaz got me feelin like all eyes on me, me against the world\nMmm, y'all got me on my shit\nThought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game\nBein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood\nCome from the same hood you come from\nWe share basically the same stories\nThought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did\nsince ninety-six, every year\nSomethin must be seriously wrong with the world\nI know y'all ain't hatin\n\n(Some people hate!) Don't tell me niggaz is hatin\n(Some people hate!) Nah.. you know what I think?\n(Some people hate!) I think..\n(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind\nY'all got me on my shit\n\nRaw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public\nMy attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it\nGot a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas\nAnd fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters\nI came from the gutter, my success in this game\nis sort of like \"Pro-jectic Justice,\" a payment for brushes\nwith police officers, a peace offering\nFrom the Gods for the streets I was tossed in\n'Til I'm deceased in a coffin\nI'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often\nPlease, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers\nIt's the strengthenin of chain among us\nPlease, we ain't afraid of none of yas, who want it with us?\nAin't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon\n\n(Some people hate!) Jeah, uh, yeah\n(Some people hate!) Uh, uhh, uhh\n(Some people hate!) Yeah.. you know what I think?\n(I think they've lost their minds) They say success breeds envy\n\nI guess it's just the penalty of leadership\nI guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit\nOr niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit\n'Fore they get to rappin, start believin it\nThink they Ali and shit\nI roll with the punches so I survive\nI bob and weave, move my feet from side to side\nI'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise\nThey try to take me out the game, but I's alive\nIt's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey\nWith a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga\nYou bastards know me, the one and only\nBig homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely\nYou need Jesus in your life.. it's either that\nor y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!\n\n(Some people hate!) I know niggaz are hatin man, let me find out\n(Some people hate!)\nJealousy's a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man\n(Some people kill their brothers)\nC'mon man be stronger than that.. you know what I think?\n(I think they've lost their minds) You'll be aight though\n\nAu contraire nigga, I am here cause I earned the shit\nBy ridin out, when niggaz had learner's permit\nWe bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit\nI bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip\nBring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your 6\nI laid back in the Maybach\nNigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggaz from way back\nNiggaz wanna clown but the pound it don't play dat\nGet yourself found, drowned, where the lake at\nRun up on 'em +Notoriously+, \"Take that!\" (take that)\nAnd then we comin where your wake at\nEight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that\nFace facts, fake rap cats\ncan't take back what I took back to the Brook', look\n\n(Some people hate!)\n(Some people hate!)\n(Some people kill their brothers)\n(I think they've lost their minds)\n(And I'm hung up.. ohh..)\n",
