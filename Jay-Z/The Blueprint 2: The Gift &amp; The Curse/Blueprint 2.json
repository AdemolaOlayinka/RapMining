Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news\nI understand what y'all trying to do\nI brought the flutes this time, though\nI unleashed the flutes on them, guru\nGimme some more music in the headphone\nLet's get the proceedings proceeding this evening\nLet's do this thing (let's do it right this time)\nC'mon\n\nH, O V A\nI got my mojo back baby, oh behave\nNaw, naw, don't be afraid\nY'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay\nY'all from afar threw thoughts my way\nWhat you thought, I would naught have nothing to say? Nope!\nY'all fell into the booby trap\nI set the trap just to see dude react, and now\nAnd now you'se can't leave\nYou opened the door god, I'm at you annually\nAnd I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez\nI call a spade a spade, it just is what it is\nBut you can't give cred to anything dude says\nSame dude to give you ice and you owe him some head\n(Shortyyyy!) It's time to wake up the dead\nYou sound a little naive in them articles that I read\n\n\nH, O V A\nThe Blueprint 2 baby, on the way\nH, O V A\nI got my mojo back baby, oh behave\n\n\nCan't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes\nProphesizing on your CDs and tapes\nWon't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes\nAnd this is with whom you want to place your faith?\nI put dollars on mine, ask Columbine\nWhen the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line\nDonating proceeds off every ticket sold\nWhen I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?\nAin't I supposed to be absorbed myself?\nEvery time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help\nThey call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude\nTo take his dollars to give gifts at the projects\nThese dudes is all politics, depositing checks\nthey put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip\nAnd y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype\nCause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright\nCause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice\nIt just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write\nIs it \"Oochie Wally Wally\" or is it \"One Mic\"?\nIs it \"Black Girl Lost\" or shorty owe you for ice?\nI've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit\nSince I will not lose, they try to help him cheat\nBut I will not lose, for even in defeat\nThere's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens it up for me\nWhen the grass is cut, the snakes will show\nI gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though\nSaving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes\nAnd I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa\nI'm back before you had a chance to miss me\nMy mama can't save you this time, niggas is history\nWho you know flow vicious as me?\nYet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov\nI get the spoils cause the victor is me (me, nigga)\nYou're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be\nThe street dreamin, all y'all niggas living through me\nI gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee\nI'm a legend, you should take a picture with me\nYou should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee\nI'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea\nAnd the little homey Jungle is a garden to me\nWhat's the problem B? You not as hard as me\nNigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga\nThat's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga\nI won't rest till you on one knee\nYou want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga\nUntil you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga\n",
