    "lyrics": "2002)\nThis here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers\nI'ma bout 'ta show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)\nand a soldier's life, parallel\nAnd the one thing they got in common is pain (forget about me for a second)\nPicture split screen\nOn one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)\nOther side you got the soldier getting ready for bootcamp (soldiers)\nThey're both at war (this is life)\nStay with us\n\n\nDid you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast\nSo don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass\n\n\nYou lost him mama, the wars calling him\nFeel its his duty to fall in line with all of them\nHe's a soldier\nRose through the ranks as the head of your house hold\nNow its time to provide bank\nLike he's supposed tah\nNow just remember while he's going to November\nTheres part of him growing up\nHis shirts soaks up your tears as he holds yah\nYour heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up\nYeah i know it sucks, Life aint a rose bud\nA couple of speed bumps\nYou gotta take your lumps\nOff to Bootcamp, the worlds facing terror\nBin Laden been happenin in Manhatten\nCrack was anthrax back then, back when\nPolice was Al'Qaeda to black men\nWhile I was out there hustling sinning with no religion\nHe was off the wall killing for a living\n\n\n\n\nDays turn to nights, nights turn to years\nYears turn to \"how the fuck we make it in here?\"\nMy barracks average couple fights a day\nGet you locked in a hole wont see the light of day\nAnd I feel like I'm just writing my life away\nI never thought shit could end up quite this way\nThere's a war going on outside no man is safe from\nI'm here for the good fight only the fakes run\nI'm here for the purple heart, if I cant take one\nFor my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?\nI love my niggas more then anything else\nThis war's about my family, me needin the wealth\nYou dont understand how useless as men we felt\nTill you become a 5 star general\nShout out to my niggas that's locked in jail\nP.O.W.'s thats still in the war for real\n\n\n\nYour baby boy is getting grown\nSo your baby boy is moving on\nI've gotta chase (gotta chase it)\nIf I'm gonna make it (gonna make it)\nYour baby boy is getting grown\nSo your baby boy is moving on\nI'm gonna make it\nEven if I gotta take it (gotta take it)\n\n\nMama said pray your sons becoming a man\nThis wars taxin to 'em like Uncle Sam\nHe ain't gonna always make the right choice, understand\nEvery choice that he make he makes it for his fam\nIt's death before dishonour\nAnd if hes gone you should honor his memory\nDont cry we all gonna die eventually\nBut if he's locked in the penetentiary send him some energy\nThey all winners to me\n(What's up kid?)\n",
