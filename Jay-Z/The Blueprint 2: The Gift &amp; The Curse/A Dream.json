I said, that's big he said\nDig what he said, proceed he said\nIndeed I said, so - breathe I did\nDon't repeat what I say I said, he said nothing\nHe agreed with his head, he just nodded like this\nWhat I believe to be a yes I repeated what was said\nIt came to me like a well as even I said\n\"What's the deal, playboy?\" was the greeting he said\nFirst thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?\n\"More money -- more problems, better believe it,\" he said\n\"Careful what you wish for you might receive it,\" he said\nI see I said, jealousy I said\nGot the whole industry mad at me I said\nThen B.I. said, \"Hov' remind yourself\nnobody built like you, you've designed yourself\"\nI agree I said, my one of a kind self\nGet stoned every day like Jesus did\nWhat he said, I said, has been said before\n\"Just keep doing your thing,\" he said, say no more\n\n\nWas it all a dream - tell me\nWas it all a dream, was it a dream\nWas it all a dream\nI gotta know (\"It was all a dream\")\nWas it all a dream - was it a dream\nWas it all a dream, a dream\nWas it all a dream\n\n\nIt was all a dream, I used to read Word Up magazine\nSalt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine\nHanging pictures on my wall\nEvery Saturday, \"Rap Attack,\" Mr. Magic, Marley Marl\nI let my tape rock 'til my tape popped\nSmoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock\nWay back, when I had the red and black lumberjack\nwith the hat to match\nRemember Rappin' Duke? \"Duh-ha, duh-ha\"\nYou never thought that hip-hop would take it this far\nNow I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight\nTime to get paid, blow up like the (\"World Trade\")\nBorn sinner, the opposite of a winner\nRemember when I used to eat sardines for dinner\nPeace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri\nFunkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky\nI'm blowing up like you thought I would\nCall the crib, same number same hood, it's all good\nUh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga\n\n\nWas it all a dream - tell me\nWas it all a dream, was it a dream\nWas it all a dream\nI gotta know (\"It was all a dream\")\nWas it all a dream - was it a dream\nWas it all a dream, a dream\nWas it all a dream\n\n(\"It was all.. a dream\")\n(\"It was all..\")\n(\"It was all.. a dream\")\n(\"It was all a dream\")\n(\"It was all.. a dream\")\n(\"It was all..\")\n(\"It was all.. a dream\")\n\n\n\n\nI see I said, jealousy I said\nGot the whole industry mad at me I said\nThen B.I. said, \"Hov' remind yourself\nnobody built like you, you've designed yourself\"\nI agree I said, my one of a kind self\nGet stoned every day like Jesus did\nWhat he said, I said, has been said before\n\"Just keep doing your thing,\" he said, say no more\n",
