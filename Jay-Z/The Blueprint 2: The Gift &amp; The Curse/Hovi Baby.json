Jay-Z extravaganza\nI'd like to introduce my band right now\nJust Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe\nRight now I want you to give the drummer some\nNo ma really, give the drummer some\nUhh\n\nTouch the untouchable, break the unbreakable\nShake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)\nYeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable\nRock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)\n\n\nFollow the flow, look\nThey say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much\nfurther than the giant.. (the giant..)\nSo I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see\nfurther than I am.. (than I am..)\nAnd I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation\nwith David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)\nBut sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course\nand I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)\nBut bein tyrant, comin through your environment\nIron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back\nWith \"The Team,\" no I in that\nR.O.C., y'all not eyein that\nY'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone\n\"The Dynasty,\" no not Ming but Shawn's\nDame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team\nStop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene\nThe other reason, we got a gang of green\nIf there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga\n\nWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Jeah, jeah\n\n\nCan't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable\nShake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)\nCan't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable\nDo the impossible (it's Hovi baby)\n\nCan't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable..\n\n\nJeah, look\nI'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life\nLook behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice\nBack to the future and gotta slow up for the present\nI'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past\nHow they propose to deal with my perfect present?\nWhen I unwrap \"The Gift & the Curse\" in one session\nAin't no livin person can test him\nOnly two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him\nSeven straight summers, critics might not admit it\nBut nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it\nIf you did it I done it before, you get I had it\nGot mad at it and don't want it no more\nAnd that goes for everything from flippin that raw\nFlippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted\nGet it right, did different, did it better, did it nice\nDid the impossible then did it twice (get it right)\n\n\n\n\nYup! Hovi's home, the global phone\nThe world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back\nYou cats overfelt yourself\nYou couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel\nIn my absence cats get, absent-minded\nNow it's time to rewind and remind 'em\nwhy I'm in the position that I am\nchangin the game, my game could nail Madonna\nWell after I'm gone, they'll honor\nhistory in the makin, Pistol Pete\nleave competition shakin without missin the beat\nChasin the hi-hat all over the track\nThe snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!\nAnd plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget\nThe watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath\nCan't see me skill for skill or check for check\nIt's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck\nLive and correct I will bring it to your set\nI got now, I don't care who got next\nRapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart\nYour flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless\nYou ain't a factor, who are you foolin?\nYou all are faggots, you takin it backwards (takin it backwards)\nI'm tryin to progress with this rap shit\nNigga, nigga your whole career is a accident\nWho was gassin 'em? (Fuck outta here!)\n",
