Then leave that fool\nBe that rude if he that cool\nSave for what? Ball til your days is up\nThis place is fucked, all type of AIDS and such\nHow they make it where you afraid to fuck\nThey gave us drugs then turned around and investigated us\nLife is short, then you on life support\nso in between it all I'ma say I seen it all, watch me\n\n\nPlace yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)\nand tell me you won't ball every chance you get (uhh, watch me)\nAt any, chance you hit (that's right) we live for the moment\n(yo, watch, watch) Makes sense don't it? Now make dollars\n(Watch me) You see me around some cheese\n(Watch me) See me with hustlers around them G's\n(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed\n(Watch me) At the bar baby, round's on me\n(Watch me)\n\n\nWatch me turn somethin out of nothin, turn platinum from gold\nWatch me light the Cohiba off the Viking stove\nI take an empty bank account, fill it with oh's\nI take an empty building then I fill it with hoes\nWatch me, cop that Coupe, shine for the ladies\nhave em sayin, \"Damn I never seen a watch that blue\"\nAnd while they still mesmerized I pop that cooch'\nShit, law enforcement couldn't stop that dude\nGuess who? Fresh off of \"Volume 2\"\nBack at you, peep the numbers my album do\nThey call me Cham-pagne-hovah, wake up with a hangover\nWhen y'all think the game's over, do the same thing over\nStill with the same soldiers\nStill gettin brain and it's plain ain't a thang gon' change over\nHop out the truck, hand on my cock and nuts\nWho got the bank, I'm stoppin it up, watch me\n\n\nPlace yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)\nand tell me you won't ball every chance you get (watch me)\nAt any, chance you hit, we live for the moment\nMakes sense don't it? Now make dollars\n(Watch me) You see me around some cheese\n(Watch me) Hangin with hustlers around them G's\n(Watch me) Blowin 'dro runnin through pounds of weed\n(Watch me) At the bar bitch, round's on me\n(Watch me)\n\n\nYo the watch too rocky, need shades\nContinental sittin on blades, spinnin like waves\nGun too Brock-y, behave\nBig shot, plus I'm feelin like Rocky these days\nIce don't melt I could ski through a heatwave\nNights won't help you see Jay, it'll be day\nMy shit too bright, I rip through mics\nplus I push more powder than Crystal Light\nChick mad, said I hold my pistol too tight\nGet a grip bitch, this how I get through life\nI buy out the bar, spit Crist' through the mic\nSee Jigga in the 6 and all the shit you like\nSee Jigga givin dick to every bitch you like\nI told her, \"It's Jay-Day and Hit-You-Night\"\nYou wanna, see me again you gotta get two dice\nI got rules I can't hit you twice, you heard me?\nWatch me\n\n\nPlace yourself in the shoes of true felons (uh-huh)\nand tell me you won't ball every chance you get (that's right)\nAt any, chance you hit, we live for the moment\nMakes sense don't it?
