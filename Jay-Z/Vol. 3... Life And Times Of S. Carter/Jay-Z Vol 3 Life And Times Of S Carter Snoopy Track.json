Who got the chicks in the truck?\nToo much to sit comfortably, they lappin up\nWho shit is big pimpin? See the flow different\nI drop heavy then I let the four-fifth flip em\nI keep rappers talkin to kids, Jigga \"Sixth Sense-d\" em\nDon't mention my name and lames in the same sentence\nYou see I'm so thorough, take on your whole borough\nBe so careful I hear the whistle from the fo'-fo' barrel\nKeep the flow Hovah; icy neck, cold shoulder\nWho click is closest to La Costra Nostra?\nIt's \"The Roc\"\n",
