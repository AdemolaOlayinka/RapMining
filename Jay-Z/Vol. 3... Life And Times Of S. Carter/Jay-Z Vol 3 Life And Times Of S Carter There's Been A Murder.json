I think there's been a..\nThink there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh\nI ahh, think there's been a..\nI.. I think there's been a..\n\n\nI hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk\nKidnap and robberies like (c'mon nigga) \"You're going with us\"\nI held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss\nnot only money but all the emotions going through us\nWhy we don't cry when niggas die, that's how the street raised him\nLook in the air, say a prayer (hail Mary) hoping God forgave him\nCop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement\nWe live dangerous, often finding ourself in the eyes of strangers\n(Who the fuck is you?) My dream is big and in it my team is rich\nas seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit\nBack to live action, I'm packing, I'm still in the mix\nlike new hits, I think I'm going over your head a little bit\nBut I let you know I changed names when I roam through town\nStay free and be who I'm professional known as now\nJay-motherfucking-Z; and with that said\nback to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh\n\n\n\n\nMy infatuation with autos led to autos getting sprayed\nHouses getting broken in, quarters getting tried\nBricks getting chopped, mom's pots getting used\nOne thrown in that water, try the soda in there too\nExpensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seat, roof gone\nCoke cheap, my face is like a coupon\nI gotta do Shawn, 'cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm\nI was getting my loot on, nigga I'm too strong\nEat till the food's gone, they placed me on this earth\nThe twin brother of Rick Porter, separated at birth\nI got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler\nFuck with us, walk through the ghetto, see the place that corrupted us\nLearn why we buck at the guys that come up with us\nAin't enough bucks for us to split in this shit\nPlus ain't nobody loving us; and with that said\nback to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uh\n\n\n\n\nSee my life is like a see-saw\nAnd until I move this weight it's gonna keep me to the floor\nTravel with me through my deep thoughts\nYou all can't learn Jigga by the shit you all be reading in The Source;\nIt's deeper of course\nFollow the life of this reckless minor\nAt sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver\nPlaying, cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us\nFlipping a bird to the choppers (fuck you coppers)\nBuck-thirty on the turns\nReckless abandon, when I'm standing on this pedal\nHand on my metal, minus all this time they trying to give me\nLord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or\nsomebody to tell me that they felt me\nI tried to play the hand you dealt me\nbut you gave me five funnies and shit\nI was hungry I need menage money\nNothing less than a 520; and with that said\nback to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is *BLAM*\n\n(Think there's been a murder-errra-ahhh-hahh-ahhh)\n",
