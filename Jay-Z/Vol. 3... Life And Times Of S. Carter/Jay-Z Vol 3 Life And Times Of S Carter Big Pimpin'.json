Shit I..\nparts with nothin, y'all be frontin\nMe give my heart to a woman?\nNot for nothin, never happen\nI'll be forever mackin\nHeart cold as assassins, I got no passion\nI got no patience\nAnd I hate waitin..\nHoe get yo' ass in\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah\nAnd let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE.. check em out now\nRI-I-I-I-I-IDE, yeah\n\nWe doin.. big pimpin, we spendin G's\nCheck em out now\nBig pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B\nYo yo yo.. big pimpin, spendin G's\nWe doin - big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe doin.. big pimpin up in N.Y.C.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B\n\nNigga it's the - big Southern rap impresario\nComin straight up out the black bar-rio\nMakes a mill' up off a sorry hoe\nThen sit back and peep my sce-nawr-e-oh\nOops, my bad, that's my scenario\nNo I can't fuck a scary hoe\nNow every time, every place, everywhere we go\nHoes start pointin - they say, \"There he go!\"\nNow these motherfuckers know we carry mo' heat than a little bit\nWe don't pull it out over little shit\nAnd if you catch a lick when I spit, then it won't be a little hit\nGo read a book you illiterate son of a bitch and step up yo' vocab\nDon't be surprised if yo' hoe stab out with me\nand you see us comin down on yo' slab\nLivin ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it\nBut nigga if you hatin I\nthen you wait while I get yo' bitch butt-naked, just break it\nYou gotta pay like you weigh wet wit two pairs of clothes on\nNow get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin to the track\nTimbaland let me spit my pro's on\nPump it up in the pro-zone\nThat's the track that we breakin these hoes on\nAin't the track that we flow's on\nBut when shit get hot, then the glock start poppin like ozone\nWe keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man\nFo' real it don't get no bigger man\nDon't trip, let's flip, gettin throwed on the flip\nGettin blowed with the motherfuckin Jigga Man, fool\n\nWe be.. big pimpin, spendin G's\nWe be.. big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nWe be.. big pimpin down in P.A.T.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B\nCause we be.. big pimpin, spendin G's\nAnd we be.. big pimpin, on B.L.A.D.'s\nCause we be.. big pimpin in P.A.T.\nIt's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B.. nigga\n\nUhh.. smokin out, throwin up, keepin lean up in my cup\nAll my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck\nEverybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall\nIf he up, watch him fall, nigga I can't fuck witch'all\nIf I wasn't rappin baby, I would still be ridin Mercedes\nChromin shinin sippin daily, no rest until whitey pay me\nUhhh, now what y'all know bout them Texas boys\nComin down in candied toys, smokin weed and talkin noise\n",
