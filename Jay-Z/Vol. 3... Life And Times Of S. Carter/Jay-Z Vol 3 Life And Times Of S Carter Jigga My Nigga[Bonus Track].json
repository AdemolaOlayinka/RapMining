I heard the same\nYou heard the name\n\n\nYeah, uhh, I got a\nlicense to kill so I stare at the gat\nRoc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggaz scared of that\nGot a new motto this year, \"Don't Fuck With My Ones\"\nKnock on your door, three in the mornin,\n\"It's just us and the guns!\"\nSee I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns\nI got the, mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy\nNiggaz get fly, let em defy gravity\nFo'-five rapidly lift your chest cavity\nStreets won't let me chill\nAlways been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill\nMuh'fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain y'all\nmore than one, like five divided by four\nShit, this just the hate that's been provided by y'all\nReciprocated and multiplied by more\nYou likely to see Jigga in a widebody or\ndrop-top Bentley Azure, holla at me y'all\nUh\n\n\nI don't give a fuck\nif I sold one or one million, but I think you should\nCause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood\nAll black in the club, the outcome ain't good\nThem niggaz act like wolves, how come? They could\nCause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash\nTil the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass\nThe necklace chipped up, the charm it flash\nCould fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash\nSee the reason why chicks let me palm they ass\nAll I gotta do is let em call me Shawn de'Glass\nLet me sit up in they whip til I launch it back\nSnap they neck, then shoot em til they arch them back\nThe calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat\nKill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back\nMonster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that\nAnd e'rybody sing-a-long to the track, c'mon\nUh-huh uhh uhh\n\n(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?\n(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?\n(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh\nNiggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO?\n(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?\n(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?\n(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh\nNiggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO?\n(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?\n(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?\n(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh\nNiggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right, WHO?\n(Jigga) What's my motherfuckin name?\n(Jigga) And who I'm rollin with huh?\n(My niggaz) Uh-huh-uh-uhh-uhh-uhh\nNiggaz better get it right, bitches better get it right..\n(Jigga) ...\n",
