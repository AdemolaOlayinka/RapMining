(Brand new Duro)\nWould ya hate me?\nI know ya love me (Feel this yo, uh)\n\n\nUh, uh, uh\nSee me comin through hair done just a slinging my shit\nWith something Gucci on clinging to my hips\nFrontin with the Star Tech ringing in the whip\nIcy ears, neck, fingers for years\nGot the show wild with the toes out\nShit I don't fuck with no stingy nigga\nI rock Prada, Chanel, and Fendi nigga\nWhat I'mma do with your little blunts and Henney nigga?\nI'mma Major Coin with a pretty Bentley nigga\nUh my niggas will ride for me\nYou should see all the things they buy for me\nUh, it's obvious how I spend my time\nAround ballers all day don't have to spend a dime\nCallin' up room service when it's dinner time\nGet my tan on in the tropics in the winter time nigga, uh, uh, uh\n\n\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 Roc)\nI know ya hate me (Cuz you know we got shit locked)\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 Roc)\nI know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)\n\n\nAy yo, we gon' stop this here\nGet this clear the general of the Roc in here\nBeanie Siegal hottest thing on the block this year\nKeep the ego we been bound to the top ya hear\nForget about it you don't know me yo stop the stares\nI've been about it pop you then pop ya peers\nYou know how I do six coup, top be clear\nYou know how I play low layer Roc-A-Wear\nCatch Siegal in the kitchen balloon in the pie\nY'all from whom to buy\nY'all niggas know if y'all cross Mac\nY'all soon to die\nCuz you know I bring heat like June and July\nSpit like August\nI'm the truth I'm not lying\nI'm the reason why Jay feel comfortable retiring\nI gotta laugh cuz y'all work hard at this shit\nThink about yo I just started this shit\nJust imagine if I put my heart in this shit\nScary sight y'all niggas feel me right\nGod damn yo I barely write\nBut every rhyme be in check like a pair of Nikes\n\n\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 roc)\nI know ya hate me (Cuz you know we got shit locked)\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 roc)\nI know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)\n\n\nYo, yo, well I'm gold now\nMemph Man Coming Of Age and I'm grown now\nSittin on chrome now\nI'm the youngest gun, I get it on with anyone\nI've been in thirty beefs shit I'm barely 21\nGuns I hold em like offensive linemen\nBring em back to the streets like a brick on consignment\nInterlining of the Mark Buchanan\nSpark two hammers\nMemph Man gold marks the understanding\n\n\nWe don't engage in war we elope\nOrange juice style beat niggas to a pulp\nWe broke nigga you just told 3 jokes\nMe, Biggs, and Dame we get some things\nSee the six dames me and Biggs live in the Range\nMine's platinum his Champagne\nNiggas whisper cuz if they talk they gets slain\nY'all's was looking for me on the charts the bricks came\nLeft the same night in the morning the chicks came\nI just use rap to put shit in my name\nThe death's just a matter of time the hit's been arranged\nContracts signed the shits in your name\nJust to lame rap niggas I'm the king\nMotherfuck the ring mami kiss the chain\nI don't got game to waste on y'all\nI'm don't think with my dick or chase my balls\nI'm a hustla hit me with an eighth of raw\nAnd when I get on top I'mma blaze all y'all\nKeep em laced some more I know you want some things\nI drink a lot of water mami come clean\nChicks I pump her then dump her\nCars we got em bumper to bumper\nRap niggas y'all days are numbered\nNobody drop nothin' next summer, yeah\n\n\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 roc)\nI know ya hate me (Cuz you know we got shit locked)\nWould ya love me? (If we couldn't cop the drop)\nWould ya hate me? (If we couldn't drop the top)\nI know ya love me (Cuz you know we pop 4 roc)\nI know ya hate me (And you know we got shit locked)\n\n\nYeah R-O-C for the 2 triple O\nYa heard me\nYou are about to witness a dynasty like no other\nBeanie Siegal, The General\nAmil-lion, Diana Ross of the ROC\nMemph Bleek, Young god\nHa, ha\nJigga Man, get ya mind right niggas\n",
