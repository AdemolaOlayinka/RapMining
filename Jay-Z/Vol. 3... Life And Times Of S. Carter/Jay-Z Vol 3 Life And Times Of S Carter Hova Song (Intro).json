It's Hova the God\n\n\nMakes you think about the people in your life\nThen I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here\nHe'd say, \"Jay, what's it about? What's life about?\nIf you don't go through as a man's a man\"\nHe'd say, \"Suck it up, take the fall, do the time\nthat's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are\"\nHow many years you been around this thing of ours?\nCommision, 125 years\nWhat's it about?\nIt's about rules, parameters\nYou take the beatin for the friend you don't lay down\nyou don't betray who you are, what you are\nYou gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory\nThey don't roar, they don't rap\nYou know why? That's the rules, you don't break them\nYou was born to be somethin I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble\nOkaay so you humble me now, what you got?\nYou got a war, you got global war\nYou got a worldwide crime syndicate now\nThere's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings\nThere's no feelings for this game\nSo.. five ten years from now\nYou're gonna wish there was American Commision\nFive ten years from now...\nThey're gonna miss Jay-Z\nOahhhkayyyyy, I'm reloaded!!!!!\n",
