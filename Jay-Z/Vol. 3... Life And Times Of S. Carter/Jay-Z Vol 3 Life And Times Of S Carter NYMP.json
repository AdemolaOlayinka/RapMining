Brooklyn..\n\n\nYo; I come through, gettin money, sittin on twenties\nNiggaz throwin me shade, but ain't shit sunny\nHot shells only thing niggaz could get from me\nCocktails thrown in your living room, KA-BOOM\nI'm so confrontational;\nthey shoulda never let me go on probation yo\nI'm a hustler; except that..\nno correctional facilities can correct that\nI took a step back, I viewed myself, seen where my head was at\nIt's where that dough is homey, gotta get that\nGotta get away, some try but head back\nUhh, street smart niggaz got left back\nSome died, they left stacks\nMe, I ball right, and on top of that I'm dog nice\nJigga been cold as fuck before ice\nNot before Christ, but a long fuckin time\nGet your mind right niggaz\n\n\nN.Y.M.P., the realest\nUh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz\nUhh uh-huh, uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz\nMarcy.. feel me..\n\n\nI looked Death in the face years back\nI held tears back, I gathered myself and stared back\nI'm from where you don't crack, the weak don't live\nYou gotta bounce back homey, the streets don't give\nI take and rape villages, who gon' stop him?\nNot Rudy Guiliani, not Hillary Rodham\nStill I still pop him\nShit I grassy knoll and hilltop him, it's all political now\nI think big when I spit at you now\nBetween my dog and the figures, the four gonna get'cha\nBetween life and death, they killed my spirit\nSo what little life I got left, y'all can expect me to ball\nI ? myself, teacher said I was a lost cause\ncause I used to roam them halls\nStill I spit knowledge, dropped out of high school, skipped college\nWho woulda thought I'd make it \"Big\" like Ms. Wallace?\n\n\nUhh, yeah, N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz\nBrooklyn, what? N.Y.M.P., the realest niggaz\nUhh, uh-huh-uh-UHH, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz\nMarcy.. Brooklyn, N.Y.M.P. the realest, feel me\n\n\nEducated, thug mu-sic niggaz\nThis is Brooklyn, this is gangsta, this is project\nReal shit, N.Y.M.P. the realest niggaz\nMarcy, Brooklyn, stompin grounds\nFuck with me\n",
