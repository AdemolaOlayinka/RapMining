    "lyrics": "Dreamed of you this morning\nThen came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me\nIf you could only see\nHow much i love you\nThat's all that's all that's all baby\nOh no, I'll never give up on you\nI never felt that before\nBut there's always....\nThat's all that's all...\n\nThis is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out\nBack-back-backing them Beemer's out\nSeems as our plans to get a grant\nThen go off to college, didn't pan or even out\nWe need it now, we need a town\nWe need a place to pitch, we need a mound\nFor now, I'm just a lazy boy\nBig dreaming in my La-Z-Boy\nIn the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin\nMama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard\nBut that's too far away, niggas are starving\nAin't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target\nI got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows\nI see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose\nI see rides, sixes, i gotta get those\nLife's a bitch, I hope not to make her a widow\n\n\nOh no, I'll never give up on you\nI never felt that before\nIts just American dreamin'\nOh no, I'll never give up on you\nI never felt that before\nIts just American dreamin'\nOh no, I'll never give up on you\nI never felt that before\nAmerican dreamin'\nBut there's always....\nThat's all that's all...\n\nNow see, the life's right there\nAnd it seems right there\nIts not quite near,\nAnd its not like we're professionals movin' the decimals\nKnow where to cop? Nah! got a connect? No!\nWho under Heaven know how to be successful\nNeed a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode\nThey say its celestial, its all in the stars\nIt's like Tony LaRussa\nOn how you play your cards\nYou all ain't fucking with me!\nThe ironies are\nAnd at all costs better before he was bars\nNow lets start, on your mark\nGet set, lets go-get out the car!\nGoing in circles, its a vicious cycle\nThis is a crash course, this ain't high school\nWake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again\nYour own reality show, the season begins\n\n\n\nStep One in this process, scramble up in your projects\nAnd head to the heights where big coke is processed\nYou gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct\nPlease speak slow, cause he no speakey no English\nIf he takes a liking after a couple of trips\nIf your money is straight, he's gonna give you consignment\nYou're now in a game where only time can tell\nSurvive the droughts, i wish you well...\nSurvive the droughts? I wish you well?\nHow sick am i? I wish you HEALTH\nI wish you wheels, i wish you wealth\nI wish you insight so you could see for yourself\nYou could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'\nAnd the cops is comin', you could read they mind\nYou could see from behind, you could redefine\nThe game as we know it, one dream at a time\nI'm American dreamin'\n",
