Nobody owns me though.\"\n\n(Your gangster is not defined)\nYour gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand over his expectations. Never forget where you came from.\n(Your gangster)\nYour gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch, but rather how many rocks you move while on your watch.\n(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes.)\nConservatives, labor, the seller, the buyer, the product, the producer.\n(See you are what you are in this world.)\nThe gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern gangsterment.\n(Gangsterment)\nGangsterment allows you to make up your own laws and create brand new words.\nGangster mentality.\n(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white, mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends, taxed by the governmentality, charted by forbes.\nIf you believe in Jay-Z then you too can be a gangster.)\nThe you too can be a gangster by any means necessary. By any means necessary, by owning that dream. I mean it's a long walk to freedom but, while deep,\ndeep, deep inside the bush.\n(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)\nDamn it feels good to be a gangster.\n(To be a gangster swagger is not a must, it's a liability, a cliche, a bad suit, cut the bullshit. You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that.)\nWhich we call, the American Gangster.\n",
