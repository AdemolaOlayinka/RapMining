Sig so rude\nTell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food\nNow see if I care if this verse get aired\nEven if you mute it the curse is there, yeah\nI'm so raunchy, bitch get off me\nKeep my flea collar on, you lil ticks get off me!\n\nI missed the part where it stopped being about Imus\nWhat do my lyrics got to do with this SHIT?\nSCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me\nStill that ain't the blame for all the shit that's happened to me\nAre you saying what I'm spitting,\nIs worse than these celebutantes showin' they kitten, you kidding?\nLets stop the bullshittin'\nTil' we all without sin, let's quit the pulpit-ing\nSCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me\nStill that ain't the blame for all the shit that's happened to me\nLets stop the bullshittin'\nTil' we all without sin, let's quit the pulpit-ing, c'mon!\n\nThis is that ignorant shit you like\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice\nC'mon, I got that ignorant shit you love\nNigga, fuck, shit, maricon, puta, and drugs\nC'mon, I got that ignorant shit you need\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick plus weed\nI'm only trying to give you what you want\nNigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it don't front\n",
