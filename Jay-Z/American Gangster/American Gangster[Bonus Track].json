Blige Reminisce on\nI hear his voice in my mind, like, nigga live on\nSo I get on that fly shit I been on\nSpin on corners in enzo with rims on\nBut for info, puffin on Endo-Nesia\nGive me amnesia\nI ease up, that right, I'm high nigga\nI want the sky,\nThe world when I'm done\nI'm give it to my sons\nLet 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up,\nSixes kit it up, man I did it up, done\nThe rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names\nI came, if the sky should fall\nAnd it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars\nDon't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the beamer\nTook trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina\nIn Ibiza I had pizza in the club\nLadies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love\nNow they wanna ya boy like Mike in his prime\nBillie Jean the goddamn boy ain't mine\nAnd the Roc break up, had the people losing hope\nCan't lie they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes\nNow I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's\nThrowing the diamond up, repping the logo\nRose gold rose flow, I'm okay though\nWhat Don't kill me makes stronger than before so\nHere we go and I'm not domino\nWhen it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw\nI might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand\nYeah that's my goal\nAnd then I bid you Freddy Adu\nProdigal Child, y'all not ready for the future\nThen I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle\nMy name will be viewed such\nHere's to the man that refused to give up\nI want the sky nigga, Chuuuuuuch\n",
