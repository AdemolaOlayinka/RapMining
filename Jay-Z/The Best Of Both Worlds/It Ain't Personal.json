(sup nigga)\nFake hugz (uh-huh) fake whassup\nFake love, fake fuck, fake thugs\nGotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up\nHop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up (uh-huh)\nAbout my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one\n\n\nWe used to get money together, phone honies together\nPushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather\nYou claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever\nCause this is business, it ain't personal\nSame dream, same team, same schemes\nWe even sold to the same damn fiends\nAin't no rules in this war for this green\nThis is business, and it ain't personal\n\n\nI wish, I wish - that success, we could all\nget a piece of it (word) but that ain't real dog (no)\nCause in these streets it's war, the industry much more\nBut rich or poor, I'ma keep it real my nigga\nInvest in chips and watch my money hill get bigger\nAnd do things like, pull up to some clubs\nin the skirts with Jigga, and yellin out HEY!\nWhat the fuck, pop that Cris' my nigga\nAnd then he wants to know how many chips I done sold\nWell it ain't y'all business what's behind my doors\nBut y'all niggaz don't appreciate shit\nHelped you out and you still actin like a little bitch\nThen you wonder why I put yo' ass in the tenth row\nwhen you asked me for some tickets to my TP-2 show\nLawwwwwwd tell me, why we don't like to see us grow\n\n\n\n\nA-Alike (uh-huh) be alike (that's right)\nWe don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike\nAnd your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed\nNope; Hov's still here like Rogaine\nAsk your boy what he did to the Hov' game\nHow he jeapordized the whole game\nNow when we see each other it's so strange\nI don't know whether to hug him or slug him (damn)\nI don't know whether to cap him or dap him\nI don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin\nBut what I do know, all the niggaz that you know\nlocked up doin a few doe, but who knows?\nMaybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too (right)\nBut I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do\nDo me a favor, place yourself in my shoes\nThe game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules\n",
