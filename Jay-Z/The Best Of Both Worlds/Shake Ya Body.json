Kelly the John Gotti\nof R&B thug and me I would say I'm probably\nthe hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and\nput it in a song, ma how could you go wrong ha? ha? ha? ha?\nWorse than a armed robbery\nKnow that I'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky\nYou can go on clockin me, ain't nuttin gon' stop me\nHigh as Allah I be, movin in peace but I\nmove with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets\nwill never remove my piece, ha? ha?, got me\nNiggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy\nMove with the glock-50, got some Tupac with me\nLet's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses\nMami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic\n\n\nMake a hole make a hole and let the Queen come past\nI come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass\nPush big things here, bet most of y'all crash\nBack to trainin lightweights, you in the wrong weight class\nHaters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem Shake\nWe \"Slam\" dance like Onyx, check my ebonics\nYou got, heat nigga you thinkin we won't blaze?\nGotta come hard cause these are the last days\nWhen I, do it I do's it, ain't no more to it (word)\nAsk (?) I puts my back into it\nFrom car dealers to Macy's, to cashiers that brace me\nWe train like the Navy for whatever the case may be\nI pass on the 6, they don't impress me much\nI want the bulletproof 7 cause the doors lift up\nThey pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?\nI got the best of both worlds, holdin me down\n\n\n\nUh-huh!\n",
