Kel\nThe best of both worlds, please believe it\nBrookland, Chi-Town, to all the beautiful ladies in the world\nDedicated to TT my niece, everybody in the world, talk to 'em Kel\nThat's right, Tone this is mean and vicious man, so mean and vicious\nRockland, Roc-a-Fella, the best of both worlds, come on\n\n\nLord forgive me I'm ballin' out of control\nGot the spirit of a hustler pouring out of my soul\nMami I love you but ain't no stopping my stroll\nIf you wanna be down with me you gotta rooolll\nLike a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold\nYou gotta know that I'm out chasin' doooough\nI'm ain't stunting these hoes\nStunting my growth if I fuck 'em I'm fleeing them\nI need something to hold\nThen I'm home to you\nI might roam like a cellular phone\nBut I never leave you alone I\nSolemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you\nIt's still a part of me there but I\nSolemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood\nPumping yay since I was yay high\nI'm in love with the life\nSo except me for the bastard that I am\nYou're still in love with me right?\n\n\nBaby I can't figure it out\nSaid you pussy tastes like honey\nBut I can't stop huggin' the block\nAll night tryna get this money\n\nStuck between these two worlds\nWhat I'm gonna do with both these girls\nTwo main squeezes in separate cities\nBoth found out man, shit ain't pretty\nStuck between these two worlds\nWhat I'm gonna do with both these girls\nHard to choose between her and these streets\nCuz the game keeps calling me\n\n\nBaby girl had me off my grind, off my clock\nI would often find I was off my block\nCouldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot\nThey never thought that a pause or stop\nWas in my pores to push rock raw\nTake a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw\nGot a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low\nLike a one against the grain\nGot the sun against my brain\nA girl in my ear\nI like her for her\nI'm a dig into this shit, I like it like I like her\nSometimes I can't figure it out\nI'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out\nShe know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house\nLock down while his niggas is out (out)\n",
