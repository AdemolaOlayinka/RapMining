Yes, yes\n\n\nSomebody's girl is at this party (woo!)\nShakin that ass to this (uh-huh)\nSomebody's girl is at this party (woo!)\nDrink that glass of Cris' (that's right)\nSomebody's girl is at this party (uh)\nSittin in V.I.P.\nSomebody's girl (yeah) is at this party (that's right)\nAnd she's comin home with me\n\n\nUmmmmmm.. I don't mean no harm\nBut your boy young Hov' got a mean ol' arm\nGot all the young ladies wanna lean on him\nAnd I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on\nNow - where's her man is not my concern\nIt's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out\nClear her whole area out\nAnd bring this whole party little nearer to my house\nNow - where's her spouse? I don't know\nSo, I don't ask, I don't probe\nI just - get in 6, get out on Rov'\nLet her, sip on Cris', go out on tours\nNow - back at the lab, I'm actin bad\nCause the, pool is warm, a booze is on\nJust a - select few, the fools are gone\nIt's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on\n\n\nSomebody's girl is at this party\nShakin that ass to this\nSomebody's girl is at this party\nDrink that glass of Cris'\nSomebody's girl is at this party\nSittin in V.I.P.\nSomebody's girl is at this party\nAnd she's comin home with me\n\n\nUhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock\nHardhead, go through walls like sheet rock\nAnd she's comin with me, when the beat stop\nWhen the party is done, I party with hon\nNow - is it my fault you neglect your broad\nand she wanna party with me, no ex at all?\nNo ex-boyfriend, no ex involved\nJust the highway exit that we exit off\nAnd I - fall back, I let her talk\nI inquire sometime, I admire her mind\nI - like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes\nI'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues\nI'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules\nAnd her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin\nthat of which she has never seen\nSo she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?\n\n\n\n\nThe moral of the story if you love your bitch\nyou better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch\nYou better - slow your roll, trick some bread\nWhen she wanna go out, you like Craig and 'em said\n\"See ya when I see ya,\" now she's callin me up\nAnd I'm like, \"Geah, of course I wanna chill\"\nNow she with the real, and you all fed\nLike, \"I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!\"\n",
