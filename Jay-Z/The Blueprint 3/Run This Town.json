Auh!)\nAnd ain't nobody fresher\nI'm in Mason\n(Ah!)\nMartin Margiela\nOn the tape we're screamin'\nFuck the other side, they jealous\nWe got a banquette full the broads\nThey got a table full of fellas... (?)\nAnd they ain't spending no cake\nThey should throw they hand in\n'Cause they ain't got no spades...\nMy whole team got dough\nSo my banquette is lookin' like Millionaire's Row\n\nLife's a game but it's not fair\nI break the rules so I don't care\nSo I keep doin' my own thing\nWalkin' tall against the rain\nVictory's within the mile\nAlmost there, don't give up now\nOnly thing that's on my mind\nIs who's gonna run this town tonight\nHey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey\nHey-hey-hey-hey-hey\nHey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey\n(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)\nHey-hey-hey-hey\n\nIt's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow\nTo everybody on your dick, no homo\nI bought my whole family whips, no Volvos\nNext time I'm in church, please no photos\nPolice escorts\nEverybody passports\nThis the life that everybody ask for\nThis a fast life\nWe are on a crash course\nWhat you think I rap for\nTo push a fucking Rav 4?\nBut I know that if I stay stun-ting\nAll these girls only gonna want one thing\nI could spend my whole life good will hunting\nOnly good gon' come is as good when I'm cumming\nShe got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string\nAnd up top, unh...\nTwo bee stings\nAnd I'm beasting\nOff the riesling\nAnd my nigga just made it out the precinct\nWe give a damn about the drama that you do bring\nI'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring\nReebok\nBaby\nYou need to drop some new things\nHave you ever had shoes without shoe strings?\nWhat's that 'Ye?\nBaby, these heels\nIs that a may?\nWhat?!\nBaby, these wheels\nYou trippin' when you ain't sippin'\nHave a refill\nYou feelin' like you runnin', huh?\nNow you know how we feel\n\nWe gonna run this town tonight!\n\nWassup!\n",
