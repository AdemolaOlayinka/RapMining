Hold up pardon my back\nI'm talkin' bout life And all I hear is\nOh yeah he keeps talkin' bout crack\nI ain't talkin' bout profit I'm talkin' bout pain\nI'm talkin' bout despair I'm talkin' bout shame\nI ain't talkin' bout gossip I ain't talkin' bout Game\nI ain't talkin bout Jimmy I ain't talkin' bout Dame\nI'm talkin' bout real shit Dem people playin'\nWhat is you talkin' bout I don't know what y'all sayin'\nPeople keep talkin' bout Hov take it back\nI'm doin' better than before Why would I do that?\nAin't nothing cool bout carryin' a strap\nBout worryin' your moms And buryin' your best cat\nTalkin' bout revenge While carryin' his casket\nAll teary-eyed Bout to take it to a matress\nI'm talkin' bout music I ain't talkin' bout rap\nYou talkin' bout who's hot I ain't talkin' bout that\nThe conversation is changed Lets yap about that\nI don't run rap no more I run the map\n\n\nThey Talk, We Live, We see what They say, They say, They say\nThey Talk, We Did, Who cares what They say, They say, They say\n\n\nStill they can't' focus on them They be talkin' bout me\nTalkin' bout what I wear Talkin' bout where I be\nCheck out my hair These ain't curls these is peas\nPeasey head still get paid I'm combin' through G's\nPlease, We ain't focused on naps\nCuz I don't run rap no more I run the map\nA small part of the reason the President is black\nI told him I got him when he hit me on the jack\nTalkin' bout progress I ain't lookin back\nYou know I run track Try not to get lapped\nPeople keep talkin' bout Hov left em flat\nTry to re-write history Lets talk about facts\nDame made millions Even Jaz made some scraps\nHe could've made more But he didn't sign his contract\nAs far as street guys We was dealin' crack\nThat's just how the game goes I don't owe nobody jack\nGrown men want me to sit em on my lap\nBut I don't have a beard and Santa Claus ain't black\nI repeat, You can't sit on my lap\nI don't have a beard Now get off my sack\nScream at me\n\n\n\n\nBlueprint 3\nAnd now that that's that Lets talk about the future\nWe have just seen the dream as predicted by Martin Luther\nNow you could choose ta Sit in front of your computa\nPosin' with guns Shootin YouTube up\nOr you could come with me to the White House get your suit up\nYou stuck on being hardcore I chuck the duece up\nPeace out Medusa\nWelcome to the Blue-ah-Print-ah Tre piece Jay-Z your tutor\nToota of my own horn Beep beep move-ya\nRas clot when rude boy come through with the roof up\nSo I could see the sky\nCause everybody talkin' Hov I think we know why\n",
