We off in Vegas drinking and partying\nWe got chicks in swimsuits modeling\nWe in the twin stretch Maybachs dipping low\nThe way the wrist shine it's so magical\nYou know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)\nNigga what you heard it's Kells and Hov\nWith the second coming of Best Of Both\nIn the first week I predict a million sold, we talking...\n\n\nBig chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga\nBig cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)\nAny day they could dig your grave\nShit, so big is my inspiration, dig\nNo reward that's the risk is taken\nIn which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places\nI on the other hand relish the situation\nThank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious\nI went overboard, look at this big bracelet\nI overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it\nFrom the time that I bought it I just replaced it\nI risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this\nWord to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this\nMa you rolling I'm as real as it gets\n\n\n\n\nBig chips! I can't take this\nThe way you move your ass slow like Matrix\nYou make me wanna toss chips in Vegas\nBefore I toss chips first, get naked\nI can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it\nSuperstar honey, so mean and vicious\nGot a lot and coming, I'm so mean and vicious\nBark bark farmer, this chicken laying platinum ex-farmer (preach!)\nSo go low mama, give it a go\nAs I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio!\nGirl you so good I'm swerving like whoa! whoa!\nUh oh! Uh uh oh! From the club to the stretch\nOut the stretch to the Hotel, into the hotel suite!\n\n\n\n\nBig chips! I'm a boss I said\nTilt my hat and I cross my legs\nLike old ladies at the park, I toss my bread\nAnd the pigeons start flocking, balling like Bishop Loughlin\nAnd stick Cochran on any DA, to try to stop him\nSo any gunplay that is an option\nI been doing this since niggas was woppin\nRocking Izods with the matching socks, and\nSlap boxing in the back park and when the girls start watching\nTry to get real, you had to drop 'em\nSee I ain't never been a fronter\nOr fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want you number\nEither you're coming or I one you\nEither you know what you want ma, I don't even want you\nYou play pretty if you wanna\n\n\n\n\nAll around the world, stop where the sun sets\nSpending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nYou wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nSay we goin around the world, stop where the sun sets\nSpending big chips you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)\nDo you wanna go (uh oh, uh uh oh!)\n\n\nUh, come on, Tone, I see you, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters\nWhat's really good, we're in the islands chilling in the shade and shit you know\nBlue waters, yellow sand, uh\nEither I'm high or, I think I just saw a dolphin\n",
