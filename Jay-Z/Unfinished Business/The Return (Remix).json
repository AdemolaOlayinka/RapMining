(one, two, three, come on!)\n\n\nMirror mirror on the wall\nWhose is the freshest of them all?\nI love 'em all, but none of y'all\nIs Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly\nWith the suicide doors, fuck 'em all\nWe got hits like a thirty shot clip\nWhen we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor\nHolla at your boy, boys\nWhen we boys, so we bringin' out them toys\nI ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's\nWiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change\nNigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank\nWe can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain\nWe can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing\nThat I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings\n\n\nMeeting Michelle at the hotel\nWhile Jay and Tone on the way to the afterparty\nGot the ladies sayin', oh\n\n\nBest of both worlds, and we rock the club\nyouknowhatimsayin\nBoy H-O, Kells, we not playing\nLosers lose, so when we does what we do, we win\nAnd win again, like deja vu\nThen we win again, like M.J. do\nThree-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue\nYoung Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move\n\n\nIn this arena, arena\nAll we wanna see is them hands up, hands up\nThis is for them hustlin' boys and girls\nIt's the return of best of both worlds\n\n\nWell once upon a time, they left the glove and the star, kid\nHe swore he was the man, but he was nothing but garbage\nLet me rephrase that, bubblin' with pride\nDid have skills, but he was ugly inside\nInstead of uplift folks, sittin' on the non sense\nHurtin' people feelings like he didn't have a conscience\nLike 'I love you', when he's hittin' that stash\nThen degraded, the shorty, like he didn't have class\nEven let a gay jew man tack his jheri\nThen, got the nerve to call the next cat a fairy\nSwindlin', forgot the god above him\nFinally, fan base trinklin' down to nothing\nNo concern for his estate, though, was yearnin' for a break\nBitter and evil, didn't learn from his mistake\nThe moral of the story is, don't be a pair of knickers\nBe good, boys and girls, and you can be as great as\nRick is\n\n\n\n\nMy baby momma's robe, my rent is overdue\nIt took half the pay, and now my life is filled with rainy days\nBut I stashed some dough, how much, you'll ever know\nIt's Doug Fresh, Slick Rick, Kells and Jay-Z\n",
