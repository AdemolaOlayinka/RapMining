    "lyrics": "2003)\nSean Carter was born December 4th\nWeighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces\nHe was the last of my 4 children\nThe only one who didn't give me any pain when i gave birth to him\nAnd that's how i knew that he was a special child\n\n\nThey say \"they never really miss you til you dead or you gone\"\nSo on that note i'm leaving after the song\nSo you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long\nAtleast let me tell you why i'm this way, Hold on\nI was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adaness Revees\nWho made love under the Siccamore tree\nWhich makes me\nA more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim\nAt 10 pounds when i was born i didn't give her no pain\nAlthough through the years i gave her her fair share\nI gave her her first real scare\nI made it from birth and i got here\nShe knows my purpose wasn't purpose\nI ain't perfect i care\nBut i feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear\nNow i'm just scratchin the surface cause what's burried under there\nWas a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared\nI went to school got good grades could behave when i wanted\nBut i had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted\nHold on\n\n\nShawn was a very shy child growing up\nHe was into sports\nAnd a funny story is\nAt 4 he taught hisself how to ride a bike\nA two wheeler at that\nIsn't that special?\nBut, i noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up\n\n\nNow all the teachers couldn't reach me\nAnd my momma couldn't beat me\nHard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, SO\nWith that distain in my membrain\nGot on my pimp game\nFuck the world my defense came\nThen Dahaven introuced me to the game\nSpanish Jose introduced me to cane\nI'm a hustler now\nMy gear is in and i'm in the in crowd\nAnd all the wavey light skinned girls is lovin me now\nMy self esteem went through the roof man i got my swag\nGot a volvo from this girl when her man got bagged\nPlus i hit my momma with cash from a show that i had\nSupposedly knowin nobody paid Jaz wack ass\nI'm geting ahead of myself, by the way, i could rap\nThat came second to me movin this crack\nGimme a second i swear\nI will say about my rap career\nTil 96 came niggas i'm here\nGood-bye\n\n\nShawn use to be in the kitchen\nBeating on the table and rapping\nAnd um, until the wee hours of the morning\nAnd then i bought him a boom box\nAnd his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts\nBut that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble\n\n\nGood-bye to the game all the spoils, the adreneline rush\nYour blood boils you in a spot knowing cops could rush\nAnd you in a drop your so easy to touch\nNo two days are alike\nExcept the first and fifteenth pretty much\nAnd \"trust\" is a word you seldom hear from us\nHustlers we don't sleep we rest one eye up\nAnd the drought to find a man when the well dries up\nYou learn to work the water without workin thirst til die YUP\nAnd niggas get tied up for product\nAnd little brothers ring fingers get cut up\nTo show mothers they really got em\nAnd this was the stress i live with til i decided\nTo try this rap shit for a livin\nI Pray i'm forgiven\nFor every bad decision i made\nEvery sister i played\nCause i'm still paranoid to this day\nAnd it's nobody fault i made the decisions i made\nThis is the life i chose or rather the life that chose me\n\nIf you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when i fade to black\n\nIf you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack\nMaybe you'll love me when i fade to black\n",
