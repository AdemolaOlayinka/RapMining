For life\nOnce again it's the life, yessss\n(I don't know why, I.. get so high on)\nIt's intoxicatin man, y'all don't know why you do what you do\n(Get so high on, get so high - high off the life)\n\n\nThe allure of breakin the law\nIs always too much for me to ever ignore\nI gotta thing for them big body Benzes, it dulls my senses\nIn love with a V-Dub engine\nMan I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted\nBey Venay kicks, or them Marvin Kaye wrists\nMy women friend get tennis bracelets\nTrips to Venice, get they winters replaced with\nThe sun, it ain't even fun no more I'm jaded\nMan, it's just a game, I just play it to play it\nI put my feet in the footprints left to me\nWithout sayin a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy\nMan my brother hustled so, naturally\nUp next is me, but what perplexes me\nShit I know how this movie ends, still I play\nThe starrin role in \"Hovito's Way\"\n\n\nIt's just life, I solemnly swear\nTo change my approach, stop shavin coke\nStay away from hoes, put down the toast\nCause I be doin the most.. oh no!\nBut every time I felt that was that, it called me right back\nIt called me right back, man it called me right back - oh no!\n\n\nI'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin distilled vodka\n'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real\nPeal the top up like a toupee\nMix the water, with the soda\nTurn the pot up make a souflee\nAll of y'all can get it like group page in your 2-way\nI'm livin proof that crime do pay\nSay hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads\nPuttin cars in they name for the stars of the game\nPuttin 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train\nAll in the name of love\nJust to see that love locked in chains and the family came\nOver the house to take back, everything that they claimed\nOr even the worst pain is the distress\nLearnin you're the mistress only after that love gets slain\nAnd the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust\nNow it gets tough to ever love a-gain\nBut the allure of the game, keeps callin your name\nTo all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain\nTo all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes\nWe all hustlers, in love with the same thang\n\n\n\n\nI never felt more alive than ridin shotgun\nIn Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns\nAnd I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need\nWhat the game did to my pulse, with no results\nAnd you can treat your nose and still won't come close\nThe game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts\nAnd I'm just a moth, addicted to the floss\nAnd doors lift from the floor and the tops come off\nBy any means necessary, whatever the cost\nEven if it means lives is lost..\nAnd I can't explain why, I just love to get high\nDrink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice\nI'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times\nI may not even be alive\nHow mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure\nDyin young, leavin a good lookin corpse\nOf course\n\n\n\nOnce again it's the life\nI said it's the life\nOnce again it's the life - oh no!\n(I don't why I) why I (get so high on)\nGet so (get so high on) uh-huh\n(get so high - high off the life!)\nHahahahahahaha - woo!\n",
