Delores Tuck-it\nOr you Bill O'Reilly, you only rylin me up\nFor three years, they had me peein out of a cup\nNow they bout to free me up, whatchu think I'm gon' be, what?\nRehabilitated, man I still feel hatred\nI'm young black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but\nYou never had me like Christina Aguiler-y\nBut catch me down the Westside, drivin like Halle Berry\nOr the FDR, in the seat of my car\nScreamin out the sunroof death to y'all\nYou can't kill me, I live forever through these bars\nI put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head\nThe whole hood'll want ya, you startin to look like bread\nI send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin bout Feds\nNigga them body-snatchers, nigga you heard what I said\n\n\nI make 'em wait for you 'til five in the mornin\nPut your smarts on the side of your garment\nNigga stop fuckin with me\nR. -- I. -- P.\n\n\nThat's right there nigga, nigga I'm wild\nNigga I keep trash bags with me\nNever know when you gotta dump a nigga out\nThis sin-surr, this some sin-surr SHIT right hurr!\n\n\nGrown man I put hands on you\nI dig a hole in the desert, they build The Sands on you\nLay out blueprint plans on you\nWe Rat Pack niggaz, let Sam tap dance on you\nThen, I Sinatra shot ya God damn you\n... I put the boy in the box like David Blaine\nLet the audience watch, it ain't a thang\nY'all wish I was frontin, I George Bush the button\nFront of all you in your car lift up your hood nigga run it\nThen lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it\nYour boy got the goods y'all don't want nuttin of it\nLike, castor oil, I Castor Troy you\nChange your face or the bullets change all that for you\n... y'all niggaz is targets\nY'all garages for bullets, please don't make me park it\nin your upper level, valet a couple strays\nfrom the 38 special, nigga, God bless you\n\n\n\n\nYeah I'm threatening ya, YEAH I'm threatening ya!\nWho you thank you dealin with?\nThey call me Threats, nigga I been makin threats\nsince I been in kindergarten nigga!\nHuh, ask about me, see if you ain't heard\n\n\nWhen the gun is tucked, untucked, nigga you dies\nlike numchuks held by the Jet L-I\nI'm the one, thus meanin no one must try\nNo two, no three, no four, know why?\nBecause one's four-five might blow yo' high\nYou ain't gotta go to church to get to know yo' God\nIt's a match made in heaven when I 'splay the 7\nPut you on the nigga news, UPN at 11\nWhere you been, you ain't heard, got the word that I'm\nthat I'm so sin-surr?\nI'm especially Joe Pesci with a grin\nI will kill you, commit suicide, and kill you again\nThat's right\n\n\n\n\nWhattup? Motherfucker I keep three motherfuckers what?\nNigga I'll throw a Molotov cocktail through your momma's momma's house\nNigga what the - where everybody live!\nUndercover nigga take your teeth out your mouth nigga\nChew your food up and put the shit back in your mouth nigga\nand help you swallow\nNigga I take a mop handle off nigga\nAnd sweep nigga - hold on, I'll be - nigga what?\n",
