Riddle me that\nThe rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at\nCan't none of y'all mirror me back\nYeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime\nI'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead\nBack to take over the globe, now break bread\nI'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express\nOut the country but the blueberry still connect\nOn the low but the yacht got a triple deck\nBut when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep\nGrand openin, grand closin\nGod damn your man Hov' cracked the can open again\nWho you gon' find doper than him with no pen\njust draw off inspiration\nSoon you gon' see you can't replace him\nwith cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS\n\n\n\n{What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}\n\n\nLook what you made me do, look what I made for you\nKnew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you\nWhen you first come in the game, they try to play you\nThen you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you\nFrom Marcy to Madison Square\nTo the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yea)\nAs fate would have it, Jay's status appears\nto be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye\nWhen I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5\nIt ain't to play games witchu\nIt's to aim at you, probably maim you\nIf I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens\nCocksucker take one for your team\nAnd I need you to remember one thing (one thing)\nI came, I saw, I conquered\nFrom record sales, to sold out concerts\nSo muh'fucker if you want this encore\nI need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore\n\n\nOWWWW! It's star time\nThis man is MADE! He's KILLIN all y'all jive turkeys\nDo y'all want more of the Jigga man?\nWell if y'all want more of the Jigga man\nThen I need y'all to help me, bring him back to stage\nSay Hova, c'mon say it!\nHO-VA! HO-VA! Are y'all out there?\nAre y'all out there? C'mon, louder!\nYeah, now see that's what I'm talkin bout\nThey love you Jigga - they love you Jigga!\n\n\nI like the way this one feel\nIt's so muh'fuckin soulful man!\n(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)\nYeah okay\n\n\nSo this here is the victory lap\nThen I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back\nAfter a year of them 16's, it's one point two\nAnd that's two point four, and I'm only doin two\nYou wanted to gain attention new dudes\nI can get you BET and TRL too\nYou wanna be in the public, send your budget\nWell fuck it, I ain't budgin!\nYoung did it to death, you gotta love it\nRecord companies told me I couldn't cut it\nNow look at me, all star-studded\nGolfer above par like I putted\nAll cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous\nHow sick is this?\nYou want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust\nSend Hip a grip, then you got' spit\nA little somethin like this, WOO!\n\n{What the hell are you waiting forrrr?}\n",
