    "lyrics": "I'm just, tryin to stay above water y'know\nJust stay busy, stay workin\nPuff told me like, the key to this joint\nThe key to staying, on top of things\nis treat everything like it's your first project, knahmsayin?\nLike it's your first day like back when you was an intern\nLike, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry\n\n\nUhh, uhh, yes, yes\nY'all wanna know, why he don't stop\nY'all wanna know, why he don't flop\nLet me tell you pe-eople why\nCame from the bottom of the block I\nWhen I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit\nHad to pull the opposite out this bitch\nHad to get my ri-ide on\nEyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to\nHad to had to get these chips\nHad to make moves like Olajuwon\nStarted out sellin dimes and nicks\nGraduated to a brick\nNo exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip\nLegendary like a schoolboy\nCrushin merely nearly every every chick\nHeavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped\nAnd got left on some \"Just +Me, Myself and I+\"\nOn some Trugoy shit\nHad your boys threw place up, to a place of no return\nHad to play with fire and get burned\nOnly way the boy ever gon' learn\nHad to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn\nNow I'm on top in the spot that I earned\n\n\nIt's my life - it's my pain and my struggle\nThe song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing\nTreat my first like my last, and my last like my first\nAnd my thirst is the same as - when I came\nIt's my joy and my tears and the laughter it brings to me\nIt's my ev-ery-thing\n\n\nLike I never rode in a limo\nLike I just dropped flows to a demo\nLike it's ninety-two again and\nAnd I got O's in the rental\nBack in the Stu' again, no prob' livin was a whole lot simpler\nWhen you think back, you thought that\nyou would never make it this far, then you\ntake advantage of the luck you handed\nOr the talent, you been given\nAin't no, half steppin, ain't no, no slippin\nAin't no different from a block that's hidden\nGotta get it while the getting's good\nGotta strike while the iron's hot, 'fore you stop\nThen you gotta bid it, good riddance\nGoodbye, this is my second major breakup\nMy first was, with a pager\nWith a hooptie, a cookpot, and the GAME\nThis one's with the stool, with the stage, with the fortune\nMaybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME\n\n\nIt's my life - my pain and my struggle\nThe song that I sing to you it's my ev-ery-thing\nTreat my first like my last, and my last like my first\nAnd my thirst is the same as - when I came\nIt's my joy and my tears and my laughter it brings to me\nIt's my ev-ery-thing\nTreat my first like my last, and my last like my first\nAnd my thirst like the first song I sang\n\n\nWoo! It's like the blues - we gon' ride out on this one\nTa-tah, be-hah\nYo Hah, 'member you was makin them dashes\nfor them niggaa at radio and shit?\nClark Kent, that was good lookin out nigga\nCarlene - who ever thought we'd make it this far homey?\nSha, they can't stop us, knahmsayin? Lenny S\nDame whattup? Robbin the bank\nNiggaz thought we was crazy man, 'member uhh\nYou had that fucked up ass handwritin\nYou was writin all the numbers that we was spendin now\nfor the videos we was doin ourselves, whattup?\nOriginal Flavor, your accountant was crazy wrong and shit\nBut we we still put it together\nBigs, whassup? 'Member we went to St. Thomas and uh\nBut y'all my nizzle, your dog peed on homey leg and shit\nat his crib - I think that was Rudy\nAnd they was havin a lil trouble with the pool\nYou and Ta-tah was laughin\nEmory was there, whattup Emory? What up Ta?\nHip-Hop, whattup man?\nAy, ay Hobb, you ain't, you ain't have no uhh\nYou ain't have no muh'fuckin seat on your, on your bicycle\nNow you uhh, the head of black music\nThat's what I'm talkin bout right there homey - G, whattup G?\nYessir, e'rybody in the Roc\nHey Guru, I know you spoiled man\nI be takin them shits in one take\nYou gon' have to punch niggaz shit, STICK IT, you gon' be tight\nOG One, whattup?\nI'm a little upset that you wasn't involved in this whole process\nBut it's all good - whassup Dash?\nMy whole family, my nephew, cousin Angie, whassup? Te-Tee\n(B, B, B, B) Mom, you made the album, how crazy is that?\nBob Allah, rest in peace\nMy pops, rest in peace (Sup A.J.?)\nBiggie Smalls, rest in peace\nUh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh\nNigga, I'm bout to go golfin man\nAy, I might even have me a cappuccino, fuck it!\nI'm goin somewhere nice where no mosquitos at nigga\nHolla at me - it's your boy!\n",
