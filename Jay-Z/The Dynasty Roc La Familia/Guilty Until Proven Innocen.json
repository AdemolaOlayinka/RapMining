Okay\nBefore me there was many; after me there will be none\nI am the one\nUh-huh, okay, I see how we playin\n\nYeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait\nNiggaz had to have it way before it's release date\nJigga get irate, press get it fucked up\nTook me one point eight but I had to get it straight\nGet the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape\nJigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate\nI get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind\nthat what's mine is mine, nobody get to take\nI don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down\nMy mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know\nI know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama\nArrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor\nBut I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most\nOut on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast\nI ain't tryin to collide with folk,\nbut I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke\nI guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!\n\n\nYou can't touch me, no you can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nTry to charge me but I'm not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nI've got all of my mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nTell me.. what y'all want from me?\nI'm not guilty\n\n\nI see how you comin at me now, I'm cool\n\nI'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich\n.. I go to the block and pitch\nI go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick\nI go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit\nLook in my eyes dog, right in my pupils\nIf I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?\nPress try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin my game\nSeemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indichted\nGot big money, big lawyers to fight it\nJust like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in\nY'all all knnow it, Jigga's a fighter\nPlus I'm clausterphobic, back on the streets before you know it\nAnd my word niggaz, I heard you niggaz\nI'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers\nFuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever\nB.I.G. is here, the soul of Tupac hovers - above us\n\n\nYou can't touch me, no you can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nTry to charge me but I'm not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nI've got all of my mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nTell me.. (I am the one)\nWhat you want from me? Not guilty\n\n\nUhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch\n\nGot lame bitches tryin to fuck with my case\nSame lame bitch I bust in her face\nHoney just mad I got her fuckin replaced\nPlus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe\nBut I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick\nBut what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch\nYou heart the rhetorhic, Jigga hit me over the head\nwith a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?\nNaw, how do y'all equate your pain\nWould it all go away if I bought you a Range?\nI got one or two of those, nothin gon' change\nFor nothin else, you gotta live with yourself\nTry and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road\nin what, most would describe as a Rolls\nNO, that's that Continental T\nThe only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty\n\n\nYou can't touch me, no you can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nAnd you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\n(I am the one) I've got all of my mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nTell me.. what you want from me?\nNot guilty\n\n\nI, am, the, one\n\nY'all, cats, can't touch me\n\n\nSo you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nSaid Jigga, Kelly, not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nAnd I got, all my, mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nI don't, know why, y'all can't see that\nY'all, cats, can't touch me\nY'all, dudes, can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nI got, all my, mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nSo tell me, what you, want from me\nY'all, cats, can't touch me\nY'all, niggaz, can't touch me\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nAnd I got, all my, mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nSo tell me, what you, want from me\nY'all, cats, can't touch me\n\nJigga, Kelly, not guilty\nI got, all, my mamis\nTell me, what you, want from me\nY'all, cats, can't touch me\n",
