You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin?\nIt's good, it's love, it's all love\nWe got cases of Belvedere, we gon' play truth or dare\nWe gon' really get to know one another\nAll you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right\nKnahmean? I'm here for you, yo\n\nRelax yourself, let your conscience be free\nYou now rollin with them thugs from the R-O-C\nAin't no place on the planet that you'd rather be\nbut in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game\nCross over to the Roc, make yourself hot\nThe topic of discussion in every nail shop\nIt's a secret society, all we ask is trust\nand within a week, watch your arm freeze up\nBrassiere get right, A to a D cup\nWeave get tight, pedicure your feet up\nEars get iced, gear get spiced\nFrom hoodrat to superstar, there's your life\nFuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell\nSay bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel\nSay hi to Gucci, Prada as well\nTake a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself\n\n\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nYou gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nYou gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nI need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nAnd I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family\n\n\nYo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice\nNow I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya\nhow to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures\nHow to play it cool when police come to pinch us\nRelax mami, let the Belvy flow\nInhale the 'dro, exhale it slow\nI could teach you how to roll, teach you bout fly kicks\nTeach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit\nWhen the beeper goes off, please don't reach\nlike you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek\nGet your mind right baby, goin through mine crazy\nWhen I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy\nTrack my last call, contact my broad\nwith a bitch ?? had physical contact in the mall\nYou got issues {inhales} problems you need to iron out\nI will, holla, for now you on time out\n\n\nYou gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C\nC'mon little mama, c'mon\nYou gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nC'mon little mama, c'mon\nI need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nC'mon baby girl, c'mon\nAnd I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nC'mon little mama, c'mon\n\n\nP-I-M-P-ology\nI played you and you paid me\nBelieve me when I tell you girl I know you a freak\nfor fuckin with me, that ain't all you can be\nJust put your mind to it you can go real far\nI know times gettin hard on the boulevard\nThey say, pimpin is dead; man, pimpin ain't dead\nThese hoes just scared and they blind tryin and dyin to be lead\nBut who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em\nGet they mind right and feed 'em\nNow I don't need 'em (uh uh) but I can do that there\nPut on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair\nso I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place\nGot yo' bitch all on my line and now she up in my face\nIs this yo' bitch is that yo' bitch cause if she's not she mine\nShe fallin fo' a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line\n\n\nGet out my limelight bitch and get your mind right\nC'mon little mama, c'mon\nGet your mind right bitch, get your mind right\nC'mon baby girl, c'mon, c'mon\n\nYou gotta play your part when you're rollin with the R-O-C\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nYou gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me\nGet your mind right ma, get your mind right\nI need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat\nGot ta get your mind right baby, get your mind right\nAnd I need gangsta girls for my gangsta family\n\n\nGet your mind right mami, get your mind right\nGet your mind right ma, get your mind right huh?\nGot ta get your mind right baby, get your mind right\n",
