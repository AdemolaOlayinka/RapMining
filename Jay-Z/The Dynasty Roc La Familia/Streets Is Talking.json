Y'know, ehh\nLook..\n\nIf I shoot you, I'm brainless\nDifferent toilet, same shit, and I'm sick of explainin this\nI'm waitin on arraignment, my nigga is the plantiff\nYeah, I know what you thinkin - fucked up ain't it?\nI shoulda known better, and I planned to\nbut dog they be takin me out of my zone like a nigga with a handle\nI sat back and watched it, put the gats back in the closet\nI tried to tie my hands like an Iraqi hostage\nLet niggaz take shots at me, no response\nI just - flip and, pop my collar like the Fonz\nYou give a nigga a foot he'll take you one step beyond\nHe'll try to play you twice, the third time is the charm\nYou wanna conversate with the writer of the Qu'ran\nor Old Testament, don't test him then\nI know what y'all thinkin dick, pause\nYour future's my past, I've been here before\nI know when you're schemin, I feel when you plottin\nI got, mental vision, intuition\nI know where you goin I read your mind's navigational system\nEverybody whisperin - pst pst pst ss perspirin\n\n\nWhen the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know.. geah geah\nYeah yeah yeah, yeah..\n\n\nYou see me with a bodyguard that means police is watchin\nAnd I only use his waist to keep my glock in\nBut when shit goes down you know who's doin the poppin\nAnd if you don't know, guess who's doin the droppin\nS dot again, y'all got him in a bad mood\nBad move; that's bad news\nHow many times have I got to prove?\nHow many loved ones have you got to lose\nbefore you realize that it's probably true?\nWhatever Jigga say, Jigga probably do\nShit I paid my dues, I made the news\nI came in the door for dolo, blazed the crews\nAnd the streets say Jigga can't go back home\nYou know when I heard that? When I was back home\nI'm comfortable dog, Brooklyn to Rome\nOn any Martin Luther, don't part with your future\nDon't ever question if I got the heart to shoot ya\nThe answer is simply too dark for the user\nAnd as a snot-nose they said that he got flows\nBut will he be able to drop those before the cops close in?\n'Fore the shots froze him, and he's dead and gone\nfrom what the block has spoken, my God\nEverybody stressin, who's his baby's moms?\nWho he got pregnant, let me tell you, ahh...\n\n\nWhen the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know.. chicka-uh-ah, ah-chk-ah-uh-ah\nChicka-ch-ah, chk-ah-ah-ah\nWhen the, streets is talkin, niggaz is gossipin\nBitches all in your shit, what's the cause of it?\nI need to know.. gi-gi-gi, geah yeah uh, yeah yeah uh\nYeah, yo, yo\n\n\nI seen my first murder in the hall, if you must know\nI lost my pops when I was eleven mmm twelve years old\nHe's probably somewhere where the liquor is takin it's toll\nbut I ain't mad at you dad, holla at your lad\nI grew up pushin snowflake to niggaz that was pro-base\nThe stress'll take a young nigga, give him a old face\nAll I did was smoke joke, think and drink\nCopped 'caine and complained, front row watch game\nI seen niggaz before me, with a chance to write they own script\nslip up and change the story\nI seen young niggaz go out in a blaze of glory\nbefore reachin puberty, scared a nigga truthfully\nI took trips with so much shit in the whip\nthat if the cops pulled us over the dog'd get sick, SNIFF\nSmell me nigga? The real me nigga, minus the rumors\nHolla if you feel me nigga\n\n\nThe streets is not only watchin but they talkin now?\nShit they got me circlin the block before I'm parkin now\nDon't get it twisted, I ain't bitchin, I'm just cautious now\nSo, under the park the extra cartridge now\nHit his click Sig' up you fell at it you're dense\nI get word to the street like Bell Atlantic express\nI feel the vibes and I hear the rumors\nBut fuck it, I'm still alive and I'm still ?? ?? Allah\nNiggaz wanna press me, put my back to the wall\nBut pressure bust pipes I know, I spat it to y'all\nTo know me is to love me, you see me, can't be me, hate this\nFuck you I got guns like Neo in +Matrix+\nCross the Family, think Mac's sweet like payroll\nor soft like Play-Doh get knocked off like Fredo\nCorleone, they find you with a hole in your dome\nI roll with niggaz that'll follow you and go to your home\nThought you ball, but nigga you fall to my defense\nCatch you while you reachin, clip you then I cross you then I'm leavin\nApply full court pressure\nlike four-four ?? get you out of here, pull pressure\nto the trigger, bullets fly in three's\nYou forever rest under bullshit, dirt lies and leaves\nI do bullshit, dirt, tell lies then leave\nLook in my eyes, realize it's Beans\nNiggaz wanna despise the team; till I play head coach\nand straight up, divide they team\nTrade they man for some pies and a couple of things\nTil the bullet.. ah, motherfuckers!! Yeah..\n",
