I I thought I was makin things better\nI made it worse\n\n\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll un-der-stand\n\n\nDear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell\nWritin this scribe, thinkin bout how you must feel inside\nYou tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow\nGod damn I ain't the young man that you used to know\nYou said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like\nbling bling ice I was wrong in hindsight\nShit we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse\nI know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out\nBut your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules\nI brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews\nAnd who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs\nCo-workers saw me on the corner slingin Larry Love\nMeanwhile, you workin hard like, two or three jobs\nTryin to feed me and my siblings, makin an honest livin\nWho am I kiddin I, call myself easin the load\nI made the load heavy, I need money for commissary\nTry to understand, please\n\n\nLet him hold you, let him touch you\nSoon you'll un-der-stand\n",
