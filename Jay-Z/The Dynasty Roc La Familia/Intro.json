Amil-lion...\nIt's the Dynasty niggaz... 2000 to infinity...\nThis is ghetto to ghetto.. gutter to gutter..\nStreet corner to street corner.. project to project..\nWorldwide... walk with us niggaz...\nHoffa... Dash... it's the Dynasty niggaz\nCheck it out...\nUhh... walk with me... talk to me... yo..\n\nThe theme song to (The Sopranos)\nplays in the key of life on my, mental piano\nGot a strange way of seein life like\nI'm Stevie Wonder with, beads under the doo-rag\nIntuition is there even when my vision's impaired, yeah\nKnowin I can go, just switchin a spare\nOn the highway of life, nigga it's sharp in my sight\nOh! Keen senses ever since I was a, teen on the benches\neverytime somebody like Enus was mentioned\nI would turn green, me, bein in the trenches\nHim, livin adventureous not worryin about expenditures\nI'm bravin temperatures below zero, no hero\nNo father figure, you gotta pardon a nigga\nBut I'm starvin my niggaz, and the weight loss in my figure\nis startin to darken my heart, bout to get to my liver\nWatch it my niggaz, I'm tryin to be calm but I'm gon' get richer\nthrough any means, with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture\nNever read the Qu'ran or Islamic scriptures\nOnly psalms I read was on the arms of my niggaz\nTattooed so I carry on like I'm non-religious\nClap whoever stand between Shawn and figures\nNiggaz, say it's the dawn/Don but I'm superstitious\nShit is as dark as it's been, nothin is goin as you predicted\nI move with biscuits, stop the harder niggaz actin too suspicious\nThis is, food for thought, you do the dishes\n",
