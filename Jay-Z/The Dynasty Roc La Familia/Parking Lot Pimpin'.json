Pick one nigga, I got a six stashed\nContinental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab\nBig cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny\nSix-four switches, slam doors on 6's\nBig trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass\nI turn automobiles to hotels on wheels\nI got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill\nBitches love when I cruise up the boulevard\nThey have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard\nThey know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad\nSpin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage\nJust Mac ?? God, the sunlight hit the ice it's flawless\nRun lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless\nBitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office\nCause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es\nWhen the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious\nNever trust grimy-ass New Yorkers\n'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous\nStandin in the Azure with white air forces\n\n\nYou can catch me in the parkin lot\nHollerin at bitches, parkin lot pimpin'\nEveryday we be off the chains\nWorkin with grain, sittin on them thangs\nTryin to find out where dem dollars at (dollars at)\nSo when I holla at you, holla back (holla back)\nEveryday we be off the chains\nAin't nuttin different, parkin lot pimpin'\n\n\nHolla at me mami! Sigel..\n\nYou can catch Mac in the parkin lot, pimpin crazy\nS-5, Navy 'Cedes, sittin on 80\nThat's four dubs, not S-4 dub\nStash box, push (Hot Wheel) like (Matchbox)\nBitches wanna push my world, they flash box\n160, push my wheel, mash cops\nCause 160 took my wheel to cash drop\nRun 60, you Big Will, match cop\nLookin through the rearview and Mac was wylin\nNew driver, screwdriver, the cracked steering column\nPushin somethin stolen, blastin, picture me rollin\nBaghdad, couldn't picture me ??\nNow the truth different, Mac come through Coupe roof missin\nI'm the truth til my fuckin roof missin\nMac stay stuck in the Coupe to school pigeons\nFeathers gettin plucked in the truck from loose chickens, listen\n\n\n\n\nYo, aiyyo I dip dip dive, what can I say?\nI can't fit 'em all inside the Escalade\nSo I called up, murder to further my parkin lot pimpin\nTold 'em get the Impala so I can start dippin\nLay back, seat recline, they notice the hand\nCar movin slow, driven by the invisible man\nEverything on the dash, digital and\nI got a fast stashbox don't make me spit at you man\nIn the parkin lot, where I spark a lot\nI come to show my new feet, slide off with a few freaks\nBleek, turn up the beats..\n.. turn up the heat then we burn up the streets, bitch!\n",
