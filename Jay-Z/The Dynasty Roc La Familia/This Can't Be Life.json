Mine dog, of course it's real\nPassin judgment, you niggaz second-guessin Beans\nCause you don't eat swine don't make you Amin\nDog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an\nI guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine\nStop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body\nMake 'em feel feel hell on earth before Allah drop thee\nI feel the line's drawn here, nuttin more can stop me\nTill them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me\nThere's only three things that make Mac not act like Beans\nAmatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin\nMy seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave dog\nShit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave dog\nI come back in the afterlife\nLike fuck it I done touched hell twice; what's the meanin?\n\n\n\n\nYeah.. uhh..\nNow as I walk into the studio, to do this with Jig'\nI got a phone call from one of my nigs\nSaid my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids\nAnd when I heard that I just broke into tears\nAnd see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is\nBut when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib\nSo I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news\nNow we both depressed, countin our blessings cause Brad's two\nPrayin for young souls to laugh atlife through the stars\nLovin your kids just like you was ours\nAnd I'm hurtin for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours\nI just know that heaven'll open these doors\nAnd ain't no bright side to losin lifel; but you can view it like this\nGod's got open hands homey, he in the midst.. of good company\nWho loves all and hates not one\nAnd one day you gon' be wit your son\nI could've rapped about my hard times on this song\nBut heaven knows I woulda been wrong\nI wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love\nIt wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us\nThis can't be life\n\n\n\n\nThis can't be life..\n",
