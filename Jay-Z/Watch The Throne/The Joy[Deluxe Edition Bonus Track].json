Yeezy\u2019s back in style\nNow one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget\nWhat\u2019s more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters\nNah, you ain't listen, they black, they \"sisters\"\nThey momma named them after white bitches\nSo next time you see me on your fallopian\nThough the jewelry\u2019s Egyptian, know the hunger\u2019s Ethiopian\nStupid questions like \u201cIs he gon' be dope again?\nHave you seen him? has anybody spoke to him?\u201d\nThis beat deserves Hennessy, a bad bitch\nAnd a bag of weed; the Holy Trinity\nIn the mirror where I see my only enemy\nYour life\u2019s cursed, well mine\u2019s an obscenity\n\n\nThis is my momma shit; I used to hear this\nThrough the walls in the hood when I was back in my pajama shit\nAfros and marijuana sticks, seeds and the ganja had it\nPopping like the sample that I\u2019m rhyming with\nPete Rock, let the needle drop\nI seen so much as a kid they surprised I don\u2019t needle pop\nTaking sips of pop, six pack of Miller nips\nPink Champale, Ballantine Ale\nBally\u2019s on my feet help me balance out well\nThat and the shit I used to balance on the scale\nI got it honest from the parties from my momma\u2019s\nVirgin Marys try to judge her\nI\u2019m like \u201cWhere the Madonnas now?\u201d\nGive all glory to Gloria\nThey said \u201cyou raised that boy too fast, but you was raising a warrior\u201d\nWe victorious, they\u2019ll never take the joy from us, uh\n\nKeep your hands up, get mine up\nDon\u2019t let them take your fire\nYeah, okay\n(It\u2019s Pete Rock, Kanye, one, two, okay)\n",
