Turn around, gave them beats to Jay\nAnd I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy\nI guess I'm getting high off my own supply\nDowntown mixing fabrics trying to find the magic\nStarted a little blog just to get some traffic\nOld folks'll tell you not to play in traffic\nA million hits and the web crashes \u2013 damn!\nSouth Park had 'em all laughing\nNow all my niggas designing and we all swaggin'\nIgnore the critics just to say we did it\nThis ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it\n\nSweet King Martin\nSweet Queen Coretta\nSweet Brother Malcolm\nSweet Queen Betty\nSweet Mother Mary\nSweet Father Joseph,\nSweet Jesus\nWe made it in America\nSweet baby Jesus, ooh\nOh sweet baby Jesus\nWe made it in America\nSweet baby Jesus, ooh\nOh, sweet baby Jesus,\nWe made it in America\n\nI pledge allegiance, uh, to my Grandma\nFor that banana pudding, our piece of Americana\nOur apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer\nStraight out the kitchen, shh don't wake Nana!\nBuilt a republic, that still stands\nI'm trying to lead a nation, to leave to my little man's\nOr my daughter, so I'm boiling this water\nThe scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order\nHold up, here comes grandma, what's up YaYa?\nWhat's that smell? Oh I'm just boiling some agua\nNo papa, bad Santa\nThe streets raised me, pardon my bad manners\nI got my liberty, chopping grams up\nStreet justice, I pray God understand us\nI pledge allegiance to all the scramblers\nThis is the Star Spangled Banner\n\nSweet King Martin\nSweet Queen Coretta\nSweet Brother Malcolm\nSweet Queen Betty\nSweet Mother Mary\nSweet Father Joseph,\nSweet Jesus\nWe made it in America\nSweet baby Jesus, ooh\nOh sweet baby Jesus\nWe made it in America\nSweet baby Jesus, ooh\nOh, sweet baby Jesus,\nWe made it in America\n",
