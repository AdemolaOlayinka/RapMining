    "lyrics": "How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?\nThere's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?\nHow can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga\nhe never even met that he dont even know and shit?\nI think this rap shit is all beef\n\nY'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress\nGot up out the streets you think a nigga could rest\nCan't even enjoy myself at a party unless\nI'm on the dance floor hot ass vest\nYou think I'm freakin' these chicks right?\nI'try not to brush against they chest\nYou get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped\nSwear to everything when I leave this earth\nIt's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt\nYou could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine\nWe'll lose two lives, yours and mines\nGimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve\nat the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve\nTold the judge didn't budge it was him or me\nand I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged\nPut my mercy on this court and my faith in God\nAnd pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky Me\n\n\nYou only know what you see,\nYou dont understand what it takes to be me.\n\nI hate all girls with alterior motives\nThat's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters\nHate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters\nHear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed\nNiggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own\nHate a nigga like that faggot, get your own\nHate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome\nKnowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon\nYou know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop\nAnd you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock\nI'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,\nIt aint no turning back. Bring It On\nHate the price of fame cause it cost too much\nCan I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?\nHate the way you make this hate flow all through us\nSteady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me\n\n\nYou only know what you see,\nYou dont understand what it takes to be me\nYou only know what you see,\n(Since I was 4 years old, I been told, everything that glitters ain't gold)\nYou dont understand what it takes to be me\n(And now that I've arrived\nI see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)\n\nNigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly\nBut I know any type of success breeds envy\nI know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me\nLeave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny\nBut G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive\nAnything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up\nAnd ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up\nDont grieve for me my art remains\nlike a dart from the speaker to your heart\nSpiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal\nPlan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life\nThough I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife\nNext time your thinking heist better be precise\nCause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here\nI have no regrets even though I wanna see grow\nMy godsons Boogie, Sonny and Rimo\n",
