Knew you had it\n'cause you took too long\nas Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on\nHuffin' and puffin' gun in my hand\ntold you step outside\nHoping you said no but you hurt my pride\nmade our way down the steps\nmaybe you thought it was just a threat\nor maybe ya life was just that crazy\nand you was beggin' for death\ntry to justify this in my young mind\nbut ya drillin' it\nand my ego hurt combined\ndrove me berzerk\nSaw the devil in your eyes\nhigh off more than weed\nconfused I just closed\nmy young eyes and squeezed\nWhat a sound\nopened my eyes just in time\nto see ya stumbling to the ground\nDamn what the fuck I done now\nrunnin' around in a circle\nthinking I'm assed out\nhot gun burnin' my waist\nran straight to Jazz' house\nLike a stranger damn I just shot my nigga\nand ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga\nLeft the scene how could I go out that way\nStill you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day\nYou must love me.\n\n\nWhat after all the wrong I've done\nI know you must\n\n\nEverything in my power and within my frame\nto protect you from this life and\nkeep you away from the game\nBut you was one of the few people\nthat I can trust\nand the fact of the matter I slang\nthese pies for us\nYou put the pressure on me dearly\nrarely would you let it go\nWas a thousand and one times\nI had to tell you no\nWhen it was one of those days\nwhen nobody was around\nand I needed emergency trip\nout of town\nSearched my mental rolodex\nfor all the numbers I know\nAs you stared in my face\nasking me could you go\nI'm agreed said sender\neverything'll go smooth\njust tell her what to do\nand everything'll go through\nStrapped her body with them thangs\nas you boarded the plane\nCouldn't explain these strange feelings\nthat I caught and the pain\nI'm thinkin' why would I send you\nwhen I knew it ain't right\nI'm thinkin' what would\nmake you sacrifice ya life\nYou must love me\n\n\nAfter everything that I've done wrong\nI know inside you must love me\nI know that you love me\nYou showed me I know it\nI know\nSay that you love me\nsay that you love me\nI know you must love me\nOh yes you do\nInside I know it\nyou've always shown it\nyou love me yea yeah\nOh yeah\nI know that you love me\n",
