    "lyrics": "1997)\nSomebody's pulling me closer to the ground\nI ain't panicked, I been here before\nSeems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage\nIn front of that crowd\nAnd showed them who was who, and what was what\nMan look at these suckers\nI ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler\nIt just so happens that I know how to rap\nOkay, I'm reloaded!\n(music drops in)\n\n\nI did it again niggaz\nFucked up, right? I know\nI know what y'all niggaz asking yourself\nIs he gonna ever fall off?\nNo...\n\n...a lot of speculation\non the monies I've made, honeys I've slayed\nHow is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?\nHustlers I've met or, dealt with direct\nIs it true he slay the beef and slept with a tech?\nWhat's the position you hold? Can you really match\na triple platinum artist buck by buck by only a single goin gold?\nRoc-A-Fella ship fold, and you're left out in the cold\nIs it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O\nFor the millionth time askin me\nQuestions like Wendy Williams, harrassin me\nthen get upset when I catch feelings\nCan I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave\nWhile I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinnin on my sleeve\nUh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?\nLike you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?\nWhat you doin in L.A., with phillipinos and ese's\nLatinos and Cheve's, down by Pico withh Frederico\nI answer all your questions but then y'all got to go\nNow the question I ask you is how bad you want to know? BLAOW!\n\nRoc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh\nKnow my style\n\nMotherfuckers can't rhyme no more, bout crime no more\nTil I'm no more, cause I'm so raw\nMy flow expose holes that they find in yours\nWasn't for me, niggaz still be dying for whores\nBut I hate when a nigga sit back, admirin yours\nYoung blood you better get that, we frying baccars\nNiggaz don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse\nAnd don't listen to the rappers, they dying to floss\nI used to be O.T., applyin the force\nShoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss\nCome back with the click playing Diana Ross\nI'm the boss and this is how it's gonna be\nBurnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V\nI got mouths to feed till they put flowers on me\nAnd kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise\nTombstone read 'He Was Holdin No Leaks'\nStarted from the crack game and then so sweet\nFreaked it to the rap game, Jigga the old-G\nOn MTV, telling em how I sold D\nAnd used to back work up out of apartment 4-B\nMe and my homie, started out coldies\nPicked the mailbox lock cause I ain't have no key\nHad the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'\nThen I went low key, but now I'm back it's on\nMotherfuckers\nJigga, uh-huh, yeah\nRoc-A-Fella y'all\nUhh, feel this\n",
