Feel me\nPeople, told ya motherfuckers, told ya\n\"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke\" -\nUhh, Roc-a-Fella\nGeyeah\n\nWe treat this rap shit just like, handlin weight\nWhat they want we give it to em, what they abandon we take\nHit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake\nPut his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake\nWhen it's hot, get on my money spot in every state\nLike the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate\nBut first we scope shit, advertise in every area\nLet the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit\nGon' need a middle man, so we look to radio\nLet em test the product, give em a promo show\nJust a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe\nThen we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five\nAin't tryin to, kill em at first just, buildin clientele\nSo when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale\nBut when demand grows it's time to expand yo\nYou don't want no garbage papi it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'\n\n\"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game\" -\n\"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke\" -\n\n\nGe-ge-geyeah\nI got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk\nGot your whole block now, pumpin my work\nMy CD's is like keys for you Willie's who\nlike to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's\nAnd my singles like gems, you know the treys\nGet you high for a while, but the, high don't stay\nYou need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks\nCause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit\nNever pitchin for a label, Jigga's the hook-up\nYou know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggaz is cook up\nJust blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota\nThey know my shit stretch without the baking soda\nWent from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key\nPriority's work wasn't right so I switched factories\nNow I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked\nNow watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, ha ha\n\n\"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game\" -\n\"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke\" -\n",
