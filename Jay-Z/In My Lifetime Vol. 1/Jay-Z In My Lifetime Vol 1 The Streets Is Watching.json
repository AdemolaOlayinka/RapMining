Hectic\nHad to call upon my wolves to send, niggaz the message\nI said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here\nI'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare'\nHey there's money to be made and, niggaz got the picture\nStopped playing with my paper and, we got richer\nThen hard times fell upon us, half of my staff\nhad warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant\nI felt like life was cheating me, for the first time\nin my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me\nWas this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that?\nI'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back\nlike bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad\nWas niggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack?\nAin't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack\nand knock a lot like two trains that's on the same track\n'Fore I get my life together like the oars I bring back\nIn the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot\nGot my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop\nSet up shop with a quarter of rock, here's the plan\nFor three straight weeks, niggaz slaughtered the block\nBut you know the game is 'lluted, fucked up me and my dues\nOne drop can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops\nand this unstable way of living just, had to stop\nHalf of my niggaz got time, we done real things\nBy ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all niggaz rhymes\nPublic apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street\nBut that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets\nThe life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime\nAnd the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind\nI figured, 'Shit why risk myself I just write it in rhymes\nAnd let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine'\nThe mindstate, of a nigga who boosted the crime rate\nso high in one city they send National Guards to get me\nYa dig?\n\nThe streets\n",
