    "lyrics": "1987)\nIt's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you\nWithout a strong rhyme to step to\nThink of how many weak shows you slept through\nTime's up, I'm sorry I kept you\nThinking of this, you keep repeating you miss\nThe rhymes from the microphone soloist\nAnd you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon\nAs you hear it, pump up the volume\nDance wit the speaker 'till you hear it blow,\nThen plug in the headphone 'cause here it go\nIt's a 4 letter word when it's heard, it control\nyour body to dance (You got it) soul,\nDitects the tempo like a red alert\nReaches your reflex, so let it work\nWhen this is playing, you can't get stuck wit\nThe steps, so get set and I'm a still come up wit\nA gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go\nDef wit the record that was mixed a long time ago\nIt can be done but only I can do it\nFor those that can dance and clap your hands to it\nI start to think and then I sink\nInto the paper like I was ink\nWhen I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines,\nI escape when I finish the rhyme...\nI got soul\n\nYou got it\nI know you got soul\n\nPicture a mic, the stage is empty\nA beat like this might tempt me\nTo pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain\nGrab the mic like I'm on Soul Train\nBut I'll wait 'cause I mastered this\nLet the others go first so the brothers don't miss\nEric B. break the sticks (you got it)\nRakim will begin when you make the mix\nI'll experiment like a scientist\nYou wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list\n'Cause I'm a manifest and bless the mic I hold\nYou want it next? then you gotta have soul\n'Cause if you ain't got it, I'm a make an encore\nTake the mic, make the people respond for\nThe R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be\nIf you wanna get on after me\nThink about it, wait, erase your rhyme\nForget it and don't waste your time\n'Cause I'll be in the crowd if you ain't controlling it\nDrop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it\nThis is how it should be done\nThis style is identical to none\nSome try to make it sound like this but you're getting me\nSo upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me\nI drip steam like a microphone fiend\nEager to MC is my theme\nI get hype when I hear a drum roll\nRakim is on the mic and you know I got soul\n\nYou got it\n\nI got soul (you got it) that's why I came\nTo teach those who can't say my name\nFirst of all, I'm the soloist, the soul controller\nRakim gets stronger as I get older\nConstant elevation causes expansion\nI write my rhyme while I cool in my mansion\nThen put it on tape and in the city I test it\nThen on the radio the R's requested\nYou listen to it, the concept might break you\n'Cause almost anyone can relate to...\nWhoever's out of hand, I'm give him handles\nLight 'em up, blow 'em out like candles\nOr should I just let him melt?\nThen give him a hand so they can see how it felt\nI'm not bold just cuz I rock gold\nRakim is on the mic and you know I got soul\n\nYou got it\n\nNow I'm a stop to see what you got\nGet off the mic before I get too hot\nI want to see which posse can dance the best\nIt should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh\nNow if your from Uptown, Brooklyn- bound,\nThe Bronx, Queens, or Long Island Sound,\nEven other states come right and exact,\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where you're at\nSince you came here, you have to show and prove\nAnd do that dance until it don't move\n'Cause all you need is soul self-esteem will release,\nThe rest is up to you, Rakim 'll say peace\n\nYou got it\n",
