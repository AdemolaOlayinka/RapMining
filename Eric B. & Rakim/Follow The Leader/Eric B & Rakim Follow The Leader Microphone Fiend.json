Beware, it's the reanamator!\nA menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon\nAn assasinator, if the people ain't stepping\nYou see a part of me that you never seen\nWhen I'm fiending for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend...\n\n\nAfter 12, I'm worse that a Gremlin\nFeed me Hip-hop and I start trembling\nThe thrill of suspense is intense, your horrified\nBut this ain't the cinemas of \"Tales From the Darkside\",\nBy any means neccesary, this is what has to be done\nMake way 'cause here I come....\nMy DJ cuts material....\nGrand imperial.\nIt's a must that I bust any mic you're hand to me,\nIt's inherited, it's runs in the family\nI wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back,\nIf that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack.\nNow I don't want to have to let off, you should of kept off\nYou didn't keep the stage warm, step off!\nLadies and Gentleman, You're about to see\nA pasttime hobby about to be\nTake it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm\nHype as a hyperchrondriac 'cause the rap be one-\nHell of a antidote, something you can't smoke\nMore than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke\nMore than cracked up, you should have backed up\nFor those who act up need to be more than smacked up\nAny entertainer, I got a torture chamber\nOne on one and I'm the remainder!\nSo close your eyes and hold your breath,\nAnd I'm a hit'cha wit the blow of death\nBefore you go, you'll remember you seen\nThe fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend\n\nThe microphone fiend...\n",
