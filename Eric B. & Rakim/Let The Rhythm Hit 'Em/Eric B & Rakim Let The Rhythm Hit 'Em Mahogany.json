    "lyrics": "1990)\nMe and Eric B was coolin' at the Paladium\nSeen a all-world covered girl, I said \"Hey lady I'm\nSorry if You're in a rush - Don't let me hold ya up\nOr interveen or interrupt, but. . .\nYou got the look - I wanna get to know ya better\nI had to let her know - but yo, I didn't sweat her\n'Cause if you woulda seen what I was seein'\nAlmost looked Korean, but European.\nWhen she spoke, her accent was self-explanatory -\nEven her body language told the story\nHer name was Mahogony - twin's name was Ebony\nI said \"My name is Ra - and this is Eric B\"\nSince the music was loud, I said \"let's take a walk,\nSo we could talk and see New York.\nShow time doesn't start until one o'clock\nAnd once I entered your mind I wouldn't wanna stop\nCaressin' ya thoughts till we was thinkin' the same\nCalm ya nerves, massage ya brain\nEach mic is a mineral, poetry's protein\nVerse is a vitamin - Affects like Codine\nSo tell me how you feel and I'll reveal\nA pill that'll heal ya pain - 'cause I'm real\nShe musta OD'd 'cause she couldn't resist\nShe spoke slowly when she told me this, she said\n\n\n\nOver Me, She's goin' crazy\nShe'll rub me on my chest and call me Mr. Sexy\nShe said she'd have my kids and help me make my next G\nTell me I ain't finesse Mahogony . . .\n\n\n\n\nSo I prescribed her, something to revive\nAnd surprise her, she's liver and much more wiser\nThan the light I shine when my brain cells spark,\nCome to me so we can glow in the dark\nAnd soon, you can represent the moon\nAs long as I keep ya in tune\nI'll tell ya who ya are and why ya here\nTake it in stride 'cause it might take a year\nIt's funny - how time flies when ya havin' fun\nWe got close and it was almost one\nShe kissed me slow, but you know how far a kiss can go\nF*ck around and miss the show\nSo I told her to hold that thought real tight\nWe can finish where we left off later on tonite\nBack to the scene of the crime on time\nAs they introduced the 'Fiend of the Rhyme'\nShe stood with a birds-eye view of me\nThinkin' of later on of what she would do to me\nThe back of the room I could see her eyes gloom\nPatient, but hopin' that the show was over soon\nAs the place was ripped in half, she made her way to the front row\nSo I said \"let's go\"\nI packed my mic as they screamed for an encore\nThe speakers were blown, plus my mic was sore\nBesides I got places to go, ladies to see\nAnd she could tell me how crazy she was over me\nWe drove off - she said she liked the way that I performed\nAnd couldn't wait to get 'soft and warm', I said,\n\"I've been watchin' you, watchin' me\nLooks I received made it hard to MC\nI can take a hint, so I knew that she\nWanted my \"Agony Agony Ag-on-y\" in her bod-y\nShowed her some sights, then I took her to the Condo\nShe was pipin' hot, but I kept my calm So\nShe asked how come I don't smile\nI said, \"Everything's fine, but I'm in a New York state of mind!\"\nAs we reached the kingdom, she said bring some\nChampagne, she'll entertain then sing some\nSentimental, songs real gentle,\nIt hit the spot and you know where it went to\nAs we embraced I felt her heart pumpin'\nI knew she was in the mood for somethin'\nSo I laid on my back and relaxed\nIt wasn't the Perignon that made her collaspe\nOver me\n",
