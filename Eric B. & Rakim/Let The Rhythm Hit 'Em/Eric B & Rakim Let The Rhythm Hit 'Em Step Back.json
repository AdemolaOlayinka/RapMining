On tour, I explore\nFrom street to street, to speak, from beat after beat\nMy cypher's complete, when I build with people I meet\nSo here's the info straight from the source in fact\nPaid the cost to be the boss, STEP BACK\ngive me room to exercise the mind\nThree-hundred and sixty degrees'll be fine\nThe weight of the world is what we hold\nThat's a six, followed by twenty-one zeroes\nSix ?? sums is a lot of weight\nMy truth is the strength and my thought won't break\nWhat it take, concentration, to rebuild our\nnation but we got to have mind power\nAnd we can make it work, because I know we can\nAnd if somethin go wrong, make another plan\nIt's up to us, so strive and be wise and\nwhen we reach the top, don't stop risin\nAnd I'll keep comin up with more of\nthe most requested songs that you all love\nReach out and touch the mic, take control\nStill gettin +Paid+ and I still got +Soul+\nAnd the only thing I ever wanted you to follow was poetry\nMind takes X-rays, so listen closely\nFrom the darkness came the light, clear out of a dark night\nNow I'm here to spark the mic\nSend out truth, for other groups and substitutes\nwith run-on rhymes and weak dubs and loops\nThey'd rather hear the arsonist, they insist\nNo need to reminisce, see if you can step to this\n\n\n\nStep back\n\n\n\n\n\nSo just step\n\n\n\n\n\nJust step, the rhymes create energy\nCharged up, by the cut, and it's sendin me\nfor a trip through the mind so I can locate\na laid back rap at a slow rate\nIt ain't hard at all, cause I invented it\nAs the days go on, you hear them with it\nBrother bustin braincells, thinkin of a rap\nwith the same old style, we had enough of that\nWe all need somethin to step to\nAnd don't forget to, cause I won't let you\ndance without hopin that this come on next\nAnd if it go off, the DJ can't flex\nCause here's the tempo, I'ma regulate the pace\nHere's the step, go find some space\nAnd what we gonna do is in unison, KICK\nShake your head, you're influenced with music\nBy now you're intoxicated, cause I prove I made it\nthe pep your step so soon you get rejuvenated\nFrom side to side, you pause and clap\nBut if you came to rap.. (step back)\n",
