    "lyrics": "Planet Earth was my place of birth\nBorn to be the SOLE controller of the universe\nBesides the part of the map I hit first\nAny a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst\nThe rough gets going, the going gets rough\nWhen I start flowing, the mic might bust\nThe next state, I shake from the power I generate\nPeople in Cali used to think it was earthquakes\n'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard\nSo I vote God and never get scarred and gauled\nBut it seems like I'm locked in hell\nLooking over the edge but the R never fell\nA trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip\nStand on my own two feet and come equip\nAny stage I'm seen on, I'M LIKE A PHENOM\nI stand alone and need nothing to lean on\nGoing for self wit a long way to go\nSo much to say but I still flow slow\nI come correct and I won't look back\n'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where\nyou're at\nEven the (ghetto)\nI learn to relax in my room and escape from New York\nAnd return through the womb of the world as a\nthought\nThinking how hard it was to be born\nBEING EQUIPPED wit no physical form\nMillions OF CELLS wit one destination\nTo reach the best part, it's life creation\n9 months later, a job well done\nMake way, 'cause here I come\nSince I made it this far, I can't stop now\nThere's a will and a way and I got THE know-how\nTo be all I can be and more\nAnd see all there is to see before\nI'M Called and go back to the essence\nIt's alot to learn so I study my lessons\nI thought the ghetto was the worst that could\nhappen to me\nI'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me\n'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves\nExileD from the original man, a straight way\nNow that's what I call hard times\nI rather be here to exercise the mind\nThen I take a thought around the world twice\nFrom knowledge NEWBORN back to knowledge precise\nAcross the desert, that's HOT AS THE ARABIAN\nBut they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian\nREaching for the city OF Mecca, visit Medina\nVisions of Neffertiti then I seen a\nMind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I\nStop and think about the brothers and sisters in\nAfrica\nReturn the thought through the eye of a needle\nFor miles I thought and I just fought the people\nUnder the dark skies on a dark side\nNot only there but right here's an apartheid\nSo now is the time for us to react\nTake a trip through the mind and when you get back\nUnderstand you're third eye seen all of that\nIt ain't where you're from, it's where you're at\nEven the (ghetto)\nEven the (ghetto)\nNo more props, I want property\nIn every borough, nobody's stopping me\nBecause I'm thorough, rhymes are making real estate\nfor me to own\nWherever I bless a microphone\n007 is back and relaxing\nOn POINT N' reactin' and ready for action\nI'm so low key that you might not see me\nIncognito and taking it easy\nQuiet, it's kept on a hush hush\nIn front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush\nBe calm, keep a low pro, and play the background\nHOPIN' the wack rapper'LL put the mic back down\nSo rip it, break it in half, go head and slam it\n'Cause when it's time to build, I'm a mechanic\nI'm bonding and mending, attaching and blending\nSo many solos, there is no ending\nPeople in my neighborhood, they know I'm good\nFrom London to Hollywood, wherever I stood\nFootprints remain on stage ever since\nAs I walk the street, I leave fossils and dents\nWhen I had sex, I left my name on necks\nMy trademark was left throughout the projects\nI used to get rich when I played celo\nWhen I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know\nSo I collect my cash then slide\nI got my back, my gun's on my side\nIt shouldn't have to be like that\nI guess it ain't where you're from, it's where\nyou're at\nEven the (ghetto)\nI'm from the (ghetto)\nWord up, peace\n",
