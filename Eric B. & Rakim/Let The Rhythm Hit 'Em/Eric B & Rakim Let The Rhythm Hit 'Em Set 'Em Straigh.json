    "lyrics": "I came to set em straight, and let em know\nWhoever's holdin the best, just let him go\nCause here's the inside scoop on the fiend\nThey wanna know why I'm seldom seen\nCause who needs the TV screens and magazines\nor shootin through the city in fly limousines\nThere's one thing I don't like, it's the spotlight\n.. cause I already got light\nThey be like, \"Yo we had a get together last week\nand we know everyone was there except the Black Sheik\"\nBecause my schedule is tight, I gotta write\nI'm deep in the archives, and keepin em hyped\nIt's been a long time, since you heard a strong rhyme\nNone of these are weak so when you bite on mine\nwe can trace the hits and then name that style\nMC'sll be out of a job for a while\nI reposess your indentification\nSo hand in your application\nPut your mic on strike until you're unemployed\nContract is up and I'm stampin it void\nYour selection ain't that selective\nSo I'ma put you in your proper perspective\nOn the dancefloor, and doin the SHAKE\nReady to let em brake, set em straight\n\n\nSomebody said I set em up and pulled the plug on em\nBut instead I let em go on so I could bug on em\nGo 'head and flow, cause I close the show\nSwing a song for the ladies and rhyme real slow\nFor instance.. once I commence..\n.. the crowd is convinced\nSo now you know who to put your money on\nHurry up, before your money's gone\nCause I'm the most common denominator\nOrchestrate a rhyme much greater\nI'm like a world almanac, so tell the media\nGivin em information like encyclopedia\nSo bring a dictionary, so you can look it up\nso you know what I mean, when I hook it up\nNo misconceptions although I complicate\nbut this concept'll set em straight\nThey even said that I was locked in jail\nSo now I guess I'm out on bail?\nThe only Island I was on was the Strong one\nAnd if I did my bid, it'll be a long one\nCause if I sold weight, I'd be upstate\nin the penile, waitin for a brake\nCause sellin drugs is for handicaps\nI got too many skills besides bustin rough raps\nIf I go to jail, it won't be for sellin ki's\nIt'll be for muderin MC's\nThe beat'll take over your heart, then I start\nto cut em in half, cause rhymes are razor sharp\nSecure the exits, all MC's remain\nCause we got a crowd to entertain\nAnd I know, when I go, I'll flow dangerous\nBrain'sll bust, what you tryin to explain to us?\nYou got lost, and couldn't go on\nCame up short, so here's one to grow on\nElevate off a high IQ\nIn time, you'll find I'm true\nCause once I start on a piece of art\nfrom sun to moon and light to dark I build the Ark\nNow you can float off the rhymes I wrote\nI'm sure that we'll hit shore without a boat\nYou could bring a battleship and still get shipwrecked\nAttacked with a torpedo, what did you expect?\nDriftin up the creek, without a beat or a paddle\nCastaway on a raft and stand fragile\nRescue your crowd, which ain't a hard job\nMe and my knowledge put together, I'm a lifeguard\nDealin with actual facts it sold out fat\nhere and now, but I go so far back\nto bring you up to date, so we can elevate\nIt's no time to wait, or anticipate\nCause I'm never late, I'm gonna motivate\nSo I can let em brake, and set em straight\n",
