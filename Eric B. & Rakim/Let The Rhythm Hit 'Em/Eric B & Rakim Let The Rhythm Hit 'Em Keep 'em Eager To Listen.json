    "lyrics": "1990)\nMe and the rap's laid back\nNonchalant and relaxed in the track\nPut together well, so it ain't hard to tell\nEasy to recognize, so my records'll sell\nOn the microphone, well known with a low tone\nShow and prove when the stage show is shown\nAll you hear is screams when I'm hit by the laser beams\nLadies fiend, rappers are choosin up teams\nSo who could beat up, just before we meet up\nBefore I kick a rhyme, I kick my feet up\nto let you know, everything's under control\nUnder surveillance, takin over your soul\nSo let me handle this, gettin scandalous\nAll my jams are hits, never plan to miss\nCrowd is captured, released at my permission\nPeep em, as I, keep em eager to listen\n\nOpponents are found paralyzed from the mic down\nLeft with a little sight ears still hear the sound\nTry to clear your mind but it's still there\nGive him about a year, then give him a wheelchair\nI damage and deteriorate, til your brain dead\nNo huss cuss what I discuss'll bust his head\nHere's some hearin aids when your eardrums fail\nYou get scars, so you could read it in braille\nClose your third eye, then I do body work\nAnd I keep the same procedure til somebody's hurt\nMy DJ'll sew up cuts like an M.D.\nAnd I still move crowds like an M.C.\nEntertain and tear you out of your frame\nLeave you in a puddle of blood, then let it rain\nThen I get deep, so try to withstand\non my level to think, or sink like quicksand\nHe couldn't hang, so I cut the rope short\nWatchin em fall, cause they need more support\nThis is the way that I done, all of my competition\nPeep em, as I, keep em eager to listen\nKeep em eager to listen\n\nThe performance I give em is, somethin like a hypnotism\nSwingin back and forth, til you can keep the rhythm\nAt the tone of my voice, you will become\neager to listen dance in a trance til you see the\nR on stage, no cheers, all ears\nAll three of your eyes on me, so it appears\njust like you thought it would be, but even better\nLive and direct on stage, instead of the\nradio or video or studio rehearsin\nI'm at my best in the flesh in person\nThe main attraction, center of attention\nThe crowd'll go crazy, soon as I mention\nit's time to communicate, so let's conversate\nI get my point across, when you respond I make sense\nSo now we could continue the mission\nAs I, keep em eager to listen\nAs I, keep em eager to listen\n\nI used to always say one day\nI'll play in the NBA cause I'll slay\nopponents well, and also excel\nas a black quarterback in the NFL\nI throw to score so I can hear the crowd roar\nKeep em, out of they seats and on the floor\nAnd when I win, it'll pump my adrenaline\nMy record is undefeated, and I'll win again\nI'll never lose or hear boos from the audience\ncause they participate, and applaud me since\nI bring em what they want to hear\nAnd they'll fill up the atmopshere\nwith people that came to party, and have a good time\nSo when I'm gone, I'm sure, you understood the rhyme\nBecause I promise to accomplish the mission\nCause I, keep em eager to listen\n",
