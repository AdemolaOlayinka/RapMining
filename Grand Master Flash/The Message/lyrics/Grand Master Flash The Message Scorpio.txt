Ah, Scorpio

He is DJ Flash and he came here to give you a blast
And we are the Furious Five and we're rocking, shocking all the way live

Higher baby
Break it down
Show no shame now
Throw your hands, way up high
And everybody's gonna try to reach the sky
Because you can't stop, won't stop playing the game
And I know that you can do it if you show no shame
Hey girl, don't be shy
Shake your body the way I, the way that I like it
With no shame girl
That's the way
Shake it baby

And Rahiem who beliefs things
And Cowboy is the real McCoy
And Dell and master, cuts much faster
And me and Rob, doing the job
And Jigsaw is giving me more
And Steve Jerome is the king of the throne
And Merob is the place to be
And Kid Creole is selling? goso?
