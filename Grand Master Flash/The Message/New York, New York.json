Rrrrrrrah!\nStand at a skyscraper reachin into heaven\nWhen over in the ghetto I'm livin in hell\nJust play ball or be an entertainer\nCause niggas like me can't read too well\nNobody loves me, nobody cares\nI dreamed about a life but I'm livin in a nightmare\nParanoid schitzo, set back, snowbound\nBad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!\nIf only I could sleep just ten more minutes\nI might find the strength to make another day\nIf I didn't have to get up, and do my thing\nI would probably sleep my whole life away\nI messed up a nice dream, somethin bout ice cream\nWhipped cream fruits and a cherry on top\nNow I gotta get up and face the world, huh\nThe pressure is on it ain't never gonna stop\nI sho' gotta learn to use my mind\nI don't wanna be kissin nobody's behind\nJust standin on line lookin like a jerk\nGotta get off my butt and do a full day's work\nI ran into a pothole, got into a car crash\nShoulda been thinkin and tried to fake whiplash\nA crowd gathered round, they're callin me fat\nWho you lookin at wit a face like that?\nNew York New York big city of dreams\nEverything in New York ain't always what it seems\nYou might get fooled if you come from out of town\nBut I'm down by law and I know my way around\nOn 42nd Street, lookin for some action\nWomen standin on the corner sellin satisfaction\nOne young punk just leanin on the fence\nTryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nReally is a prankster, tried to be a gangster\nReal big wheel when a gun is in his hands\nJust did a stick-up, just got picked up\nOne dead punk, killed by the man\nNew York New York big city of dreams\nAnd everything in New York ain't always what it seem\nYou might get fooled if you come from out of town\nBut I'm down by law and I know my way around\nToo much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah\nToo much, too many people, too much! HUAHH!\nA baby cries and a mother dies\nAnd the tears fall from the doctor's eyes because\nIn this room, on this day\nThe Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh\nThe gift of life really means a lot\nAnd in the ghetto your life is all you got\nSo you take to the streets, tryin to exist\nIn the trash and slime of a world like this\nWhat you watch, on TV\nA tells you what life is supposed to be\nBut when you look outside the only thing you see\nIs the poverty stricken, reality, heh\nAbandoned places, angry faces\nMuch hate and hunger throughout the races\nYou say, \"I'm grown and I'm on my own\nSo why don't everybody just leave me alone!\"\nNow you stay at home, talkin on the phone\nDoin ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone\nThey never took the time to tell you bout sex\nSo you had to learn about it in the discotheques\nNine months later, the baby is there\nAnd the nigga that did it said, \"I don't care!\"\nYou don't have enough money to help feed two\nSo you have to choose between the baby and you\nThe sky was cryin, rain and hail\nWhen you put yo' baby in the garbage pail\nThen you kissed the kid and put down the lid\nAnd you tried to forget what you just did, huh\nThe muffled screams of a dyin baby\nWas enough to drive the young mother crazy\nSo she ran in the rain tryin to ease the pain\nHuh huh, and she drove herself insane\nNew York New York big city of dreams\nBut everything in New York ain't always what it seem\nYou might get fooled if you come from out of town\nBut I'm down by law and I know my way around\nAh too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah\nToo much, too many people, too much! HUHHH!\nNew York New York big city of dreams\nBut everything in New York ain't always what it seems\nYou might get fooled if you come from out of town\nBut I'm down by law and I know my way around\nToo much, too many people, too much... ha hah hah hah\nToo much, too many people, too much\n",
