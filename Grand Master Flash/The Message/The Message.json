    "lyrics": "It's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\n\nBroken glass everywhere\nPeople pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care\nI can't take the smell, can't take the noise\nGot no money to move out, I guess I got no choice\nRats in the front room, roaches in the back\nJunkies in the alley with a baseball bat\nI tried to get away but I couldn't get far\nCause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car\n\nDon't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nStanding on the front stoop hanging out the window\nWatching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow\nCrazy lady, living in a bag\nEating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag\nSaid she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango\nA Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses\nDown at the peep show watching all the creeps\nSo she can tell her stories to the girls back home\nShe went to the city and got social security\nShe had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own\n\nMy brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV\nSays she watches too much, it's just not healthy\nAll My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night\nCan't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight\nThe bill collectors, they ring my phone\nAnd scare my wife when I'm not home\nGot a bum education, double-digit inflation\nCan't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station\nNeon King Kong standing on my back\nCan't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac\nA mid-range migraine, cancered membrane\nSometimes I think I'm going insane\nI swear I might hijack a plane!\n\nMy son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school\n'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool\nAnd all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper\nIf I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper\nOr dance to the beat, shuffle my feet\nWear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps\n'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny\nYou got to have a con in this land of milk and honey\nThey pushed that girl in front of the train\nTook her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again\nStabbed that man right in his heart\nGave him a transplant for a brand new start\nI can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark\nKeep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run\nI feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw\nHear them say \"You want some more?\"\nLiving on a see-saw\n\nA child is born with no state of mind\nBlind to the ways of mankind\nGod is smiling on you but he's frowning too\nBecause only God knows what you'll go through\nYou'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate\nAnd your eyes will sing a song called deep hate\nThe places you play and where you stay\nLooks like one great big alleyway\nYou'll admire all the number-book takers\nThugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers\nDriving big cars, spending twenties and tens\nAnd you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh\nSmugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers\nPickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers\nYou say \"I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool\"\nBut then you wind up dropping outta high school\nNow you're unemployed, all null and void\nWalking round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd\nTurned stick-up kid, but look what you done did\nGot sent up for a eight-year bid\nNow your manhood is took and you're a Maytag\nSpend the next two years as a undercover fag\nBeing used and abused to serve like hell\nTil one day, you was found hung dead in the cell\nIt was plain to see that your life was lost\nYou was cold and your body swung back and forth\nBut now your eyes sing the sad, sad song\nOf how you lived so fast and died so young so\n",
