Now make dollars\nCats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis\nAnd rack up frequent flier mileage\n\nGotta let it show, I love the dough, hey\nI love the dough, more than you know\nGotta let it show, I love the dough, hey\n\nI'm poppin Magnums while Jigga bag somethin\nWatch is platinum, got jet lag from\nflights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes\nMake the best CD's and the best tapes\nDon't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals\nBiggie be Richie like Lionel, shit\nYou seen the Jesus, dipped to H classes,\nIce project off lights, chick flashes\nBlind your broke asses, even got rocks in beards and moustaches\nRock top fashions\nAin't shit changed, except the number after the dot\non the Range, way niggas look at me now, kinda strange\nI hate y'all too\nRather be in Carribean sands with Rachel\nIt's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal\nBitches used to go, \"Ewww!\"\nStill tote steel, trying to see five mil\noff the sin-gle, for real\nYou ain't fazing the amazing\nWhile your gun's raisin, mine is blazing\nSee you on see me all talking to sweetness\nTake it for weakness and leave quick\nBlocker, rocker, fellow, Bad Boy collabo\nTwo MC's with mad dough, jewelry on!\n\nI love the dough, more than you know\nGotta let it show, I love the dough, hey\n\nMiracu-lous, pockets stay full\nNiggas skip the bull cause we matadors\nSnatch the P-89's that we pack in the drawers\nAnd we, clappin doors in your Acuras\nSnap like, cameras or amateurs\nMake you all dance, hold a hammer to yours\nJig and Big rock ice, no cracks in flaws\nEverybody got a part to play, back to yours\nRun up in your crib now, crack your doors\nWatch the real players live, it's a habit to floss\nPlay the charts like the Beatles, y'all dap to loss\nAnd toast Cristal on behalf of y'all\nToo bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours\ntruly, do we, we laugh at y'all\nLittle bastards y'all\nUhh, uhh\nWe hit makers with acres\nRoll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us\nLost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq\nCountry house, tennis courts on horseback\nRiding deciding cracked crab or lobster\nWho say mobsters don't prosper\nNiggas is actors, niggas deserve Oscars\nMe I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain\nReminisce on dames who, coochie used to stink\nWhen we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links\nNow we buy homes in unfamiliar places\nTito smile everytime he see our faces\nCases catch more than outfield-ers\nHalf these rappin cats, ain't seen war\nCouldn't score if they had point game, they lame\nSpeak my name, I make em dash like Dame\n\nI love the dough, more than you know\nGotta let it show, I love the dough, hey\n",
