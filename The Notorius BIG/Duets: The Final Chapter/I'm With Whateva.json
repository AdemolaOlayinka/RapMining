(Jones, Capo)\nCash Money (Santana)\nDipset (Lil Weezy)\nLet's Ride\n\nCause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)\nIt's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Watch It)\nCause real g's know the feeling (It's Murda)\nIt's hard body, no remorse for the killing (Weezy)\n\n\nMad trees and bitches in dungarees\nThe city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees\nI love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze\nI'm from another breed, them sss, southern g's\nI sip phemetrazine, I lean, I stand tall\nI'm mean, I'm mad raw, I'm coming like fastball\nSteee-rike, Yup, so get it right\nNigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life\nYou ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife\nIn a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork\nSo be smart and play your own part\nIf you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart\nAnd we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell\nHey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail\nYea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich\nWeezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6\n\n\nAll night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn\nGot my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?\n(Watch it) I ain't going out without a fight\nI'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight\nI'm with whatever and I ain't going out without a fight\nI'm with whatever, It'd be your life before my life\nAt night, I can't sleep, I toss and turn\nGot my hand on my pistol, when will these motherfuckers learn?\n\n\nIt's showdown time, throwdown time\nSame d-off, four pound time\nClack Clack, go get yours, I'll go get mine\nCheck it man, I'm wit whatever\nGoodness gracious the paper\nWhere the cash at? Where the stash at?\nI'll blow that ass back for fronting on a nigga like me\nYou got nothing on a nigga like me, you'll see\nI'm on the grind from sun up to sun down\nIf I'm lying, may lightning come down and strike me right now\nI'll turn a dollar to a twenty to a fifty to a hundred\nKeep it coming til I'm full on my stomach\nI'm stuck in my ways, I'm stuck puffing my hase\nHand on my pistol, front of it sprays\nI'm stuck living the life of a ghetto nigga\nTrying to get rid of the life, alright?\n",
