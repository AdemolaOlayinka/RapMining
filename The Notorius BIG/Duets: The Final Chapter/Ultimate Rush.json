To get this nookie, be fortunate\nJust like tastin pussy with pork in it\nPeople stop when I'm walkin in, I'm twist-in twistin 'em\nBack on ten, I'm talkin 'bout like when Mase come back again\nMy ski's is immaculate, my paper stackin keep trackin\nI'm mackin yo slackin, reaction makes ya'll dicks grin\nI'm mo' better than gold diggers with figures\nMo' bigger than Jigga's and even Paris Hilton's\nDamn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines, me one, give you none\nSent am-ilia, all you wanna do is sniff me\nThe ultimate rush, get high baby\nDamn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines, me one, give you none\nSent am-ilia, all you wanna do is sniff me\nThe ultimate rush, the drugs baby\n\n\n\n\nNow Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love with 'em\nHit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business\n\n\nI like the kind of whine and dine, who grindin all the time\nYo ex girl was a fly, but now lucked up on a dime nigga\n\n\n?? with you, all you wanna do is lay around\nAnd stay around and get mad when I play around\n\n\nI like to lay never work, put your money in my purse\nTo the mall, I go search matchin shoes for my skirt\n\n\nTuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get wit me\nWednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say\n\n\nMe and my friends got your Benz, attractin mens\nAnd spendin dividends, blowin like the wind\n\n\n\n\nSo I guess you think I'm slippin cause I ain't flippin\nBaby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin\n\n\nI ain't trippin nor flippin, I'm just liquor sippin\nAt the bar, tippin wit your money, can you pay the difference?\n\n\nIt seems like it's a waiste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme\nI hear you jump in every car, except for mines\n\n\nNigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a super star\nFace way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall\n\n\nAll I do all day is drink Tanqueray\nThinking of a way to put a smile on your face\n\n\nMake me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features\nMy waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek\n\n\nShould I whine and dine? You put ring on your fingers\nWhile sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers\n\n\nSex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers\nI flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger\n\n\nYou better slow your role baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me\nYou know the pin number, just page me when you will baby\n",
