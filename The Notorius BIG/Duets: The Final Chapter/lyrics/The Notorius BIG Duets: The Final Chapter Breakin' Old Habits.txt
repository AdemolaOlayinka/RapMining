Slim Thugga..
I roll scrap glock 40 in my left
I rap but still think like im grindin in the trep
Trynna dept to the change from the streets to the game
Cant be selling cds n still selling dem thangs
Cause bitches drop names n bring alot of piorblems
N puttin somthing in dey head the only way u gona solve em
Jack a stay plottin watchin ur every move
N the minute u snooxe will be the minute u lose, dude
Das the rules so I jcruise wit the 2's
To fix the damn fools dat think im slippin wit my juice
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Das y u see me on the same block wit the same crew
N everybody sitting fat living good
N im the only nigga dat be rappin in my hood
I was raise by the hustlas n gain by the g's n taught by the bosses howda stack that cheese


U got rich n g shits still a part of u cause breakin old habits so hard to do
U still watch for da haters n the rugged crew cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When I was shot dat nigga like I started to cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out da dealership crackin up wit cigarsin the coup man cause breakin old habits so hard to do


Damn it feel good to see people up on it flip 2 keys in 2 weeks n didnt flawlet
My brain is haunted wit mean dreams gs's wit bb's on it, supreme skeems to get richer the Richie quickly
Niggas wanna hit me if they get me dress my body in linen by Armani
Check it, my lyrical carjack make ur brun splat high callable gacks is all I fuck wit now keep the rough shit
In my circumfrence mad bitches, wit mad noochies bulletproof vestes under they coochies spitting my oozie dont lose me,
My trigger niggas represent driving dirty in jay 30 getting bent
Until my hit hos my murder mamis
I b smoking trees in Belize when they find me while u still killing niggas wit my lali like cami and cyber supres cypress fucking roy on the floor wit
The finest
While I just slip coke smoke pounds of chope got lawyers watchin lawyers so I wont go broke now check it, dem country niggas call me frank white im
Spurtin off in my lawf of cousrse I kno my shits tight, suprise open my eyes still suprise got my shorty flying in wit keys taped to her thys wit lovely
Utincils suhen my suhen my china thing she half black half orientak 86 she got me rentals


U got rich n g shits still a part of u cause breakin old habits so hard to do
U still watch for da haters n the rugged crew cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When I was shot dat nigga like I started to cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out da dealership crackin up wit cigarsin the coup man cause breakin old habits so hard to do


I use to drive a chevy monte carlo bricks n blow all in it
I was taught to sell dis shit u putcho nose all in it
Let my bitch drive da benz but dem roads off limit
N how u call urself pimpin wit hos all in ur bidness
Wut it is the music bidness of the streets make the decision
I do dis in my sleep n u way outcho division pimpn
Dis game we play fo keeps n da rules remain hiddn
Dis aint a place fo laying da snitchin shit is forbidn
I was sittin in da kitchen n weepin wit hopes of getting back
All dat I forget to go blow see even 50 stacks
N now am sittin back thinkin bout the time
When a nigga get a 100gs think he went down
When I look for loyalty  in the game it ain't fair
N thangs aint da same they change it aint fair
Real niggas there doin dey time n aint here
U commit da same crime come home da same year


U got rich n g shits still a part of u cause breakin old habits so hard to do
U still watch for da haters n the rugged crew cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When I was shot dat nigga like I started to cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out da dealership crackin up wit cigarsin the coup man cause breakin old habits so hard to do
