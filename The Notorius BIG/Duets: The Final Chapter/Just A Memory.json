B.I.G.\nLet's go\n\n\nNiggaz in my faction don't like asking questions\nStrictly gun testing, coke measuring\nGiving pleasure in the Benz-ito\nHitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's\nHope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats\nRun up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets\nSix up in your wig piece, nigga decease\nMuah!, may you rest in peace\nWith my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours\nFour-four, and fifty-four draw\nAs my pilot, steers my Leer\nYes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear\nHere's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying\nThe kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying\nSo don't you get suspicious\nI'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious\nAs I leave my competition, respirator style\nClimb the ladder to success, escalator style\nHold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all\nBig don't fold y'all, (big don't fold y'all)\nI spit phrases that'll thrill you, (thrill you)\nYou're nobody till somebody kills you (I don't wanna die)\n\n\nDo you know where your going too\nJust a memory...everybody dying\nWhen I throw my clip in the AK\nMay you rest in peace\nYour nobody till somebody kills you\n\nDo you know where your goin too\nJust a memory...so you better pack a pistol\nEverybody dying, death controls y'all\nYour nobody till somebody kills you\n\n\nLabel limbo, I treat it like the wind blows\nMy back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk\nSpin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke\nSoul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke\nTrust me they can't touch P, in one touchie\nTurn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy\nAdmire the verses, their inspired by the hearses\nThat carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing\nImagine the glamour that comes out the flow\nOf a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa\nThe wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing\nAnd the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, (yes!)\nOn the flipside, the steel I'm gripping\nYou thought all the floss had me slipping?\nThink again, blink again let me know that your bluffing\nLead give permanent concussion, your nothing\n\n\n\n\nHa ha ha ha ha check out the fisad\nOn the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar\nA mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car\nBentley coupe another short of the arnage\nEven as a youth I was laudering the stoop\nUnderneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue\nI was pushing keys in a V with no roof\nRich, black, two big guns and no coof\nThings at the label, well they tend to get unstable\nAnd that pretty much leave Malice at the table\nOr over the stove with the flame to the ladle\nBecause Im a provider as long as I am able\nThis here hughe the most foolish of blues\nWhen I tell my mom the price\nShe damn near sent me to my room\nIt's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S\nYou don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh\n\n\n\n\nBiggie Duets...\nBorn Again...\nLife After Death...\nLegacy lives on..and on, and on\nThese motherfuckers still can't see you BIG\nshit you ain't even here..\nMotherfuckers better step their game up..\nGreatest of all time, Greatest of all time!\nMotherfuckers...\n",
