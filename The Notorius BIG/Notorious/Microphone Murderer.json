(\"Paaaapeerrrr! \")\nFlippin on Old Gold, cold as the rhymes you stole\nPuffin' on dime bags and I been told.\nMy words are harder than a brick, Chinese arithmetic\nA thick stick and my dick!\nMakes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme G\nYou get what you pumpin' is Tic-Tac time Z.\nThe B.I.G. moves swifter than a ninja\nEven on stickups I'm the masked avenger! (\"Paaaapeerrrr! \")\nKeep my eyes open and the case closed\nNo eyewitnesses, no names or expos!\nJust the heavyset one with the big gun\nAnd a sweet tongue shakin down everyone.\nLoot like Michael Jackson kicks like Bo Jackson\nBenz like Freddie Jackson. - No need to ask in the crew!\nOooh! - No frontin', no fakin' moves\nFightin' or fuckin'. - Resort to the stick and move. (\"Paaaapeerrrr! \")\nSmack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree\nRhyme is mine cause I said it's me!\nStep to a Big Man grippin the mic stand\nKeep a bankroll and so do 50 Gran'.\nAnd - I give you my hand cause you deserve a pound\nTryna blow up the spot - in my part of town.\nBraves, because you get no praise\nI teach you like a {CENSORED} did the A's. (\"Paaaapeerrrr! \")\nRecognize, I don't fuck with the St. Ides\nB.I.G. down with \"O.G.B.\"\n\"Old Gold Brothers\" for the others that missed me\nThe crew stay deep on Bedford and Quincy.\nRhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand,\nYou want it to be on, there's a Tec in the garbage can!\nI pull bitches like Kim Fields, Brooke Shields\nShelley Long, Connie Chung. - I can go on and on! (\"Paaaapeerrrr! \")\nWord is bond I'm a don!\nI split 'em and run up in 'em I fuck 'em and then I duck 'em.\nI hit 'em in the shitter and forget her!\nAnd it gets better! - B.I.G. - are the letters! Niggaz know the pedi'...\n\nThat's the end!\nWhat you want me to do?\nDAMN!\n",
