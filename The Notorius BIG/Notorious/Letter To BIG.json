I ain't even good with writin\nI don't even write shit\nI just felt, I had to write this letter to BIG\nNiggas is actin like..................letter to BIG\nUh, yo\n\n\nDear Christopher Frank White Wallace\nYeah it's your boy Kiss I just wanna holla\nIn your memory I keep the Coogi in my closet\nKangol on the rack, a fresh pair of Wallies\nYou know I'm still the liquor and the weed child\nAnd still got Branson on speed dial\nAnd everybody's the king now\nYou ain't gotta be nice gettin shot is the thing now\nMafia was doin there best they seperated\nNow Roc and Gutta doin a stretch, uh, yeah\nKim is still in it to win it\nI seen Money L awhile ago but I ain't heard from Cease in a minute\nPeople in power is queer\nI could go on for a year 'bout how it would be if you were still here\nThe game got cheaper, rappers is more commercially successful now\nBut the heart's alot weaker\nYou know me still got the flow that'll pop speakers\nFirst option on offense the top feature\nIt's easy BIG all you need is a protool set\nAnd I ain't touch the paper that I was supposed to yet\nEverybody that's somebody show respect\nOnly a matter of time before they notice that\nI'm an impecable lyricist\nAnd with the right mechanics, I could take over be clear of this\nThey well aware of Kiss the light of the city\nAnd I ain't on the label no more but I'm tighter with Diddy\nI got my own plan handle mine like a grown man\nLong as I know I'm nice, fuck it I'm my own fan\nRemixed the joints you had\nBut, they could never ever duplicate your swag (Never)\nMeanwhile I'm a keep it so on my lil' plans\nAnd you might bump into a few of my lil' mans\nUp there steppin with God\nDown here Mister Cee in BK still reppin you hard\nTianna so pretty, CJ turned into a Lil' Biggie\nJust a little lighter but so witty\nOn your born day, we get the highest\nGroovy still the best with the garments, he keep me the flyest\nTonight, Patron is dead\nOnly right that I take a bottle of Bacardi Limon to the head\nAnd before I end it, I gotta say thanks\n'Cause not only was your time well-spent, it was splendid (thanks)\n...Miss you, my nigga\nOne Love (So we tried to hard to understand)\n\n\nSo we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away\n(That was my letter to B.I.G., nahmean?)\nYou were everything - you were everything\n(I felt it was only right, I really smoked with them niggas)\n\n\nSo we'll just keep our heads to the sky (Drink wit 'em)\n(Sat wit 'em, talked wit 'em)\n'Cause we know we're gonna see you in the next lifetime (Real shit)\nBut it's never easy saying good-byyyyye\n(See you when I get there, Biggie)\nSaying - good-byyyyyyyyyyye (Love you)\n\n\nSo we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away\nYou were everything (Why you had to go awaaaaaay?)\nSo we tried to hard to understand, why you had to go away\nYou were everything (Oooo-hooo-oooo-hooo-oooo-hoooo...)\n",
