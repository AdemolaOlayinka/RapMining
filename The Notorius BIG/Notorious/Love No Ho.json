You look like you got problems, man!)\nAyo man!\nPssh, man...\nIt's this fuckin' BITCH man!\nShit I know I ain't 'sposed to have no feelings for these hoes out here man, but...\nThis bitch on the back of my mind man! (word?)\nYeah man!\nDone wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man! (Let me hear it!)\nWant me to drop the drama kid? (Yeah!)\n\nYeah, dedicatin this to you man\nCause my man 50 Gran' told me straight up and down man\nI ain't 'sposed to love no ho!\nKnahmsayin'?\nI tried to tell her 50!\nI got three rules in life!\nI'm not to be played with... played on or played out!\nI'm a drop it like dis!\n\nLyin' in my bed. - I'm lookin' at four walls\nEcho in my head sayin I got a lot of gall.\nGrippin my cap, my pen in my teeth\nThinkin' what this ho said, she called me a: \"Thief\"!\nShe said I stole her heart. - And didn't leave a trace\nI told her I was sorry and she said get out my face.\nWalked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket\nPlayin' +Love Is A House+! -Aand thinkin' how she jocked it.\nWhen she had the key - to open up my door\nAdore - that Prince scam that got me on the floor.\nI know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it,\nI say: \"Go buy a pie! \" - The girl would go bake it.\nMakin' a record was important to me\nMore important than her that's what made her flee, see?\nThe mistake was not payin' no mind\nAll her posse said we was two of a kind.\nI call her back twice. - Your sister said you're broke\nShe said: \"When you left, your ears was full of smoke! \"\nChokin' on a cigarette you don't even smoke\nJumped in the train station put in a token.\nCoulda been my partner, my amigo my peer,\nJust waitin for them three words that all girls wanna hear.\n\"I love you! \" HUH! - You would start to cry if\nI would reply with I-L-Y!\nThen I tell your friends - that you played me out\nSaid I wouldn't say: \"I love you! \" Just to make you shout!\nSo I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone,\nYour sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home.\nI heard you in the back cryin' up a storm\nScreamin how you wish that I never was born.\n\"I hate him! I hate him! \" That's what she kept sayin'\nShe'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin'.\nBut now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line,\nJust say that you hate me! - Or say that you're mine!\nI said: \"When I played ball you was in the stands!\nWhen I was sick, you held my hand!\nIt was hard to say before, but now I can\nBitch I love no ho! - FUCK YA! \"\n\nI don't give a fuck about'cha\nTake a long walk off a short peer bitch!\nTry to take bankrolls...\nBum bitches outta here 50, man!\nNow check it!\n\nCome to my crib she say: \"B.I.G. listen!\nI don't like the way you been dissin'!\nFeel like I been kissin other bitches cause my lips feel chapped\nI tell you it's on the blunts, you ain't tryna hear that! \"\nNow I'm Henny'd like a fuck? - What's the riff?\nWho I'm sleepin with? - I ain't got the time to shoot the gift\nTo hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll.\nI ain't fuckin' nobody. - Case closed!\nYou hit the lights and decide to doze off,\nNo kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off.\nAnd my dick is harder than a rock,\nNobody to cockblock but you's a hardrock!\nThe fuck you think I am, gay?\nI ain't got no time to play I ain't got nuttin' to say.\nBounce out the crib! - Just to see my man, 50\nAnd what's up with B.I.G.\nAnd the O.G.B.! - You know they keep plenty hookers!\nAnd I ain't a bad looker.\nSo I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh!\nShit is cool! (Dude: Trust no hoes! - All they want is bankroll!)\n\nThat's what I'm tryna tell you now, baby!\nMy man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers, knahmsayin?\nI ain't lame to this!\nCan't spell game without me, the B.I.G.!\n",
