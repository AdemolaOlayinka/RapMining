Junior M.A.F.I.A.! (Remix)
Uhh, Junior M.A.F.I.A.!

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Yeeeeeeeeah, yeeeeeeeeeah!
So goooooood, so goooooood!
I loooove you sooooooo much!
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...

First things first, I poppa! - Freaks all the honies! (uh-huh!)
Dummies! (uh!) - Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money.
Those the ones I like cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation.
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs,
Heart throb? Never! - Black and ugly as ever!
However - I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks! (uh!)
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me (uh-huh!) navajos creep me in they tee pee! (uh!)
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet
Stop it! (uh!) - If you think they gonna make a prophet!
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns! - Get it?
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it (uh!) then split it!
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. (uh!)
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya!
I'm clockin ya, Versace shades watchin' ya! (uh-huh!)
Once ya grin, I'm in, game begin! (uh!)
First I talk about how I dresses this,
In diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses! (whooo!)
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper! - Help ya reach the (uh-huh!)
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late, and sing the break! (uh!)

Baabyyyyyy, heeeeere I am (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Aaaaall, I neeeeed is ooooone more chaaaaaance! One more chance...
IIIII can heeelp (uh!) you fiiiiiind, yourseeeeelf! (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Cause you, don't neeeeeed (uh!) noboooo-dy eeeeelse! - One more chaaaance... ("Remix! ")

She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz,
There I is! (uh!) - Major Payne like Damon Wayans (uh-huh!)
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan.
Schemin'! (uh!) - Don't leave ya girl round me
True player for real, ask Puff Dad-dy! ("yeeeah! ")
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel. (uh!)
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell (uh-huh!)
She beeped me, meet me at twelve! (uh!)
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, payin car notes? ("yeeeah! ")
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke! ("uh-huh! ")
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat! (uh-huh!)
Nuttin left to do but send her home to you,
I'm through! - Can ya sing the song for me, boo?

One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)

So, what's it gonna be? - Him or me? (uh!)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls. (uh-huh!)
The envy of all women - crushed linen!
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em. (whoooo!)
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'!
High fashion - flyin' into all states (uh!)
Sexin me while ya man ! ("uhh, uhh! ")
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds. (uh!)
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent (what?)
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president! (uh!)



Bad Boy, Bad Boy!
