{First things first! } I Poppa - freaks all the honies (uh-huh!)
Dummies! (uh!) - Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money!
Those the ones I like cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration - unless it smells like sanitation!
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob? Never! - Black (uh!) and ugly as ever!
{However, I stay Coogi down to the socks}
{Rings and watch filled with rocks! } (uh!)

{Girls pee pee when they see me, Navajos creep me in they teepee! } (uh!)

{Stop it! (uh!) - If you think you're gonna make a profit? }
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns! - Get it?
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it, then split it (uh!)
In two {as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.}

{Low Down, Dirty even, like his brother Keenan! }
Schemin'! (uh!) - Don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real {ask Puff Dad-dy! } (uh!)
You ringin bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel, uh!
{Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell! }
{She beeped me, meet me at twelve! }
Where you at? - Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes? (yeeeah!)
While I'm swimmin in ya women like the breast stroke! (uh-huh!)
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat! (uh-huh!)
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you;
I'm through! - {Can ya sing the song for me, Boo? }

So, what's it gonna be, him or me? (uh!)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls! (uh-huh!)
The envy of all women - crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em. (whoooo!)
(Finest women I love with a passion!)
(Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin!)
(High fashion - flyin' into all states?)
(Sexin' me while ya man masturbates!)
(Isn't this great?) Your flight leaves at eight
(Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds, uh!)
Lyrically I'm supposed (uh!) to represent
