    "lyrics": "Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves\nGazelle shades, and corn braids\nPitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies\nShootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly\nLoungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews\nwith the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues\nTurn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three\nNiggaz is gettin smoked G, believe me\nTalk slick, you get your neck slit quick\nCause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit\nTotin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project\nhallways, shootin dice all day\nWait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit\nWe get hype and shit and start lifin shit\nSo step away with your fist fight ways\nMotherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though\n\nNo more cocoa leave-io, one two three\nOne two three, all of this to me, is a mystery\nI hear you motherfuckers talk about it\nBut I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it\nAnd I'm down with the shit too\nFor the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu\nInstead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin\nSlugs in his back and, that's what the fuck happens\nwhen you sleep on the street\nLittle motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep\nAnd we comin to the wake\nTo make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake\nBack in the days, our parents used to take care of us\nLook at em now, they even fuckin scared of us\nCallin the city for help because they can't maintain\nDamn, shit done changed\n\nIf I wasn't in the rap game\nI'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game\nBecause the streets is a short stop\nEither you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot\nShit, it's hard being young from the slums\neatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from\nAnd now the shit's gettin crazier and major\nKids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers\nGoin outta town, blowin up\nSix months later all the dead bodies showin up\nIt make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie\nBut I gotta go identify the body\nDamn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?\nEverytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out\nShit, my momma got cancer in her breast\nDon't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed\n",
