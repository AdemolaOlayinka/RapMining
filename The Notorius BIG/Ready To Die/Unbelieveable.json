Biggie!\nYou know how the weed go, unbelievable\n\nB-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G.\nGet it? Biggie\nAlso known as the bon appetit\nRappers can't sleep need sleepin Big keep creepin\nBulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin\nDumb rappers need teachin\nLesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that, oh I, thought he was wack\nOh come come now, why y'all so dumb now\nHunt me or be hunted, I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways\nTo summer sautee, I'm the winner all day\nLights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway\nMy forte causes caucausians to say\nHe sounds demented, car-weed scented\nIf I said it, I meant it\nBite my tongue for no-one\nCall me evil, or unbelievable\n\nBuck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupe's\nLeave no witnesses, what you think this is\nAin't no amateurs here, I damage and tear\nMC's fear me, they too near not to hear me\nClearly, I'm the triple beam dream\nOne thousand grams of uncut to the gut\nIt seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill\nTryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer\nThe gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver\nGet ready to die, tell God I said hi\nAnd throw down some ice, for the nicest MC\nNiggaz know the steelo, unbelievable\n",
