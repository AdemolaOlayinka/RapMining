Why not?\nWhy blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot\nNow check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed\nBelieve me, sweety, I got enough to feed the needy\nNo need to be greedy. I got mad friends with Benzs\nC-notes by the layers, true fucking players\nJump in the Rover and come over\nTell your friends jump in the GS3,\nI got the chronic by the tree\n\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nThrow your hands in the air, if you's a true player\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nTo the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nIf you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?\n'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby\nBaby\n\nStraight up, honey. Really, I'm asking\nMost of these niggaz think they be mackin but they be acting\nWho they attracting with that line, \"What's your name, what's your sign\"?\nSoon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind\nAnd ask what your interests are, who you be with,\nThings to make you smile, what numbers to dial.\nYou gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew\nYou go call your crew\nWe can rendezvous at the bar around two\nPlans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease\nPull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt\nSo we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly\nA t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape\nConversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do\nWhat we came to do, ain't that right, boo. True\nForget the telly, we just go to the crib\nAnd watch a movie in the Jacuzzi, smoke Ls while you do me\n\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nThrow your hands in the air, if you's a true player\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nTo the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nIf you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?\n'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby\nBaby\n\nHow ya living Biggie Smallz?\nIn mansion and Benzs\nGiving ends to my friends and it feels stupendous\nTremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream\nStill tote gats strapped with infrared beams. What?\nChopping Os, smoking lye and Optimos\nMoney hoes and clothes all a nigga knows\nA foolish pleasure, whatever\nI had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure\nHowever living better now, Gucci sweater now\nDrop top BMs I'm the man girlfriend\nHoney, check it, check it\nTell your friends, to get with my friends, your friends\nAnd we can be friends\nShit, we can do this every weekend. That's right\nAight? Is that aight with you?\nYeah... keep banging\n\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nThrow your hands in the air, if you's a true player\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nTo the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies\nI love it when you call me Big Poppa\nIf you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?\n'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby\nBaby\n\nUh, check it out,\nMy full shit, for that ass,\nUh, Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls,\nJunior M.A.F.I.A., represent baby bay-bay!\nUh!\n",
