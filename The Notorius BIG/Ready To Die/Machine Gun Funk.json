    "lyrics": "So you wanna be hardcore\nWith your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps\nBut I can't feel that hardcore appeal\nthat you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin\nThis ain't Christopher Williams, still some\nMC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some\nTo let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy\nI get up in that ass like a wedgie\nSays who? Says me, the lyrical\nNiggaz sayin, \"Biggie off the street, it's a miracle\"\nLeft the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me\nJust for niggaz actin shifty\nSticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker\nEspecially when I'm drunk off the liquor\nSmokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is\nnatural to eat you niggaz like chocolates\nThe funk baby\n\n\n\n\"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk\" (LOTUG, Chief Rocka)\n\n\n\nAll I want is bitches, big booty bitches\nUsed to sell crack, so I could stack my riches\nNow I pack gats, to stop all the snitches\nfrom stayin in my business, what is this? Relentless\napproach, to know if I'm broke or not\nJust cause I joke and smoke a lot\nDon't mean I don't tote the glock\nSixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen\nUntil we motherfuckin meet again\nHuh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now\nCome on the ave, I'm real hard to find now\nCause I'm knee deep in the beats\nIn the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats\nFor the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the (car sirens)\nI'll make you prove that it's bulletproof\nHold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks\nI got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick\nThe funk baby\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side\nHow I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside\nBed-Stuy, the place where my head rests\nFifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test\nThe rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya\nHigh as a motherfuckin helicopter\nThat's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor\nBeatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina\n(What's Love, Got to Do)\nwhen I'm rippin all through your whole crew\nStrapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns\nI got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons\nNiggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life\nMaking money smoking mics like crack pipes\nIt's type simple and plain to maintain\nI add a little funk to the brain\nThe funk baby\n",
