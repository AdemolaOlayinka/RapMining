    "lyrics": "My father died the day I came outta my mother's hole\nAnd left the burden on my soul until I was old enough\nTo understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much\nHe loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he shake Junt\nBringin' pops to school today for twelve years I cheated\nTold the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and\nBring that dude to life then he wasn't at the meeting\nMade a U-turn on the weather like the fuck am I thinking\nBirthdays, Christmas my only fucking wishlish was CD's\nAnd a new fitted instead I got some CD's\nI hated, some Ritalin, some white socks\nI was hyper cause I didn't get attention from my real pops\nCops say I'm supposed to be in jail but they don't know it's me\nStatistics say that niggas with no father ain't go be shit\nWell I guess I had one because nigga I'm it\nYou smell that? That's the odor of success bitch\nI know I'm not the only bastard, in America\nSo I'm gonna need some help, on this next part, scream it with me niggas\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car nigga (Fuck you)\nEat a dick nigga, bitch\nFather's Day was the worst when it came to gifts\nCause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get\nNow my momma mentioned the day before she would like\nCause she's playin' both roles like her occupation was dyke, fuckin' right\nI ain't look up to Obama and Nixon, I looked up to the Hugo's and Dixon's\nThe niggas in the vision rap about the shit they cookin' in the kitchen\nPushin' keys like them niggas that were bangin' on the Keynes\nMy father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie\nHe bought me hoodie a couple albums\nLike that's gonna make up the years and the tears\nAnd the money that my momma spent on rent and clothes\nYou fuckin' dicked out, I swear to God if I see you\nI'mma get out the M-16 and let a fuckin' clip out\nCause in 16 years, you let your kid down the existence, none\nI don't give a fuck either like father like son I'm done\nHe ain't give a fuck about me\nHe ain't give a fuck about you\nHe ain't give a fuck about we\nSo what the fuck we gon' do?\nFuck you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I graduated)\nWithout you (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nNigga eighteen (I'm good)\nFuck you (I'm good)\nGot a car nigga (Fuck you)\nEat a dick nigga, bitch\nThe cold is nice, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather\nThe skin is thick, no need for leather, your father called\nHe said you're better without him, I'm not the only fuck\nWithout them, how to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed up\nTake it to the shop, then what?\nFuck it, mommas proud of her asmatic thin fuck\nLuck on my brim Supreme keeps me warm\nWhen the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer\nThe bummer is the fact that I'm black\nAnd I hang with white neos who's nero stays frio\nNow this consulor is tryna tell me that I'm emo, she don't give a fuck\nD-low where's the trigger, I'll let this bullet play hero\n",
