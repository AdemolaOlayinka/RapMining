No, nigga fuck the system\nOdd (I'm a young man)\nFuture (I'm a little boy)\nWolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)\nGang (Let's parade in gold)\nGood kids make bad grown ups\nStay gold, stray old, maturin' means that your life sucks\nIn my wolf suit, I roam where the wild things at\nStill growin', still learnin', not knowin' that I'm Matt\nI don't wanna grow up, I know that shit for a fact, nigga eighteen\nOdd (I'm a young man)\nFuture (I'm a little boy)\nWolf (Yes I'm over-joyed)\nGang (Let's parade in gold)\nThey say I'm immature, I say that they depressed\nI talk to unicorns, I'm wearin' a uniform\nOf a nigga that don't give a fuck about time\nYou live your life all serious while I'm enjoyin' mine\n",
