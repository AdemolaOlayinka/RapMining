    "lyrics": "I was taught to act my shoe-size, never my age\nI always judge a book by the cover, never the page\nI never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage\nThat he felt when he dealt with physological phase\nThey say that I never cease to amaze\nWhile half my mental belongs in a cage\nThe ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch\nIf you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit\nSelling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest\nBut then they'll get my mom for 18 years of posession\nShe showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection\nThe pigs fly away in the morning\nBut I ain't get to see you today\nAnd if I wanna go outside\nI gotta make sure that I can play here\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nWell you ain't been looking through my eyes\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly, no\nRight next to the fat lady hitting high notes\nWent to sleep at seven then we woke up from the dream\nWore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme\nSo I guess that's where I hide my things\nCaged, and the wonder is seen\nMiddle finger missing so I can not give a fuck\nI can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck\nSo I'm chasing the dreams, no realities\nHoping that maturity won't be too mad at me\nBut If so, I'll take the scorn and indeed happily\nLong as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet\nFatherless kids orphans like me and Domo is\nA fuck that we will never give is like our pops\nBut what we did was found our niche and made a stitch\nJust like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit\nThe pigs fly away in the morning\nBut I ain't get to see you today\nAnd if I wanna go outside\nI gotta make sure that I can play here\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nI bet you've never seen a pig fly\nWell you ain't been looking through my eyes\nAnd my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight\nDon't go home tonight, chill, don't go home tonight)\nAnd my circus is all night (Don't go home tonight, chill\nPlease stay, don't go home tonight, don't go home tonight)\nI'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow\nThe therapist said hell, oh would my mama wonder\nI was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers\nLike Food for Thought was my father but I ain't had the hunger\nMy self esteem is like me, tall and full of flaws\nMy pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall\nI know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves\nBut I wear mine on my head, Supreme\n",
