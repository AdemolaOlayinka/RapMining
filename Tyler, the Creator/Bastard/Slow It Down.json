    "lyrics": "We come through throbbin' like thunder storms\nMake them feets get wet and funky up in they under arms\nI'm too explosive for your ears like I'm throwin' bombs\nWith the exclusive on the channel, bitch I know it's on\nNiggas get mad like cheerleaders, they throw they pom-poms\nSuck a dick, eat salam gettin' they nails done in salons\nHodgy Beats is like limp balm\nIf you talk shit, I'll make you cry and tell your big moms\nI got nice hands, niggas eat out my big palms\nHaters must be starvin' nowadays I make California Vietnam\nAnd I'm goin' to embalm my creativity\nInto a CD-rom, so you can feel this shit up on\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, yeah\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, oh my God\nTurn it up nigga, where's the bass?\nCould you bring the keys? Yeah\nTurn it up, nigga where's the bass?\nDrop the drums\n=Pink chinchilla, cause I'm like Thrilla\nMy t-shirts are bathin', a bathin' gorilla\nYou niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda\nBut I ate that whole plate like a fat bitch dinner\nI'm never the winner, always the loser\nI don't choose to win, but I will choose her\nHer kitty-cat fish loves his tuna\nI never use a fork I always spoon her\nGo nuts, instrumental flow much\nEuropean model white bitch is eatin' donuts\nFuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch\nMakin' shit come like I'm go-go gadget\nI'm mental, it's instrumental\nMake your future therapist ask for dental records\nAnd I hope this record have you stabbin' niggas with colored pencils\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, yeah\nTurn it up, where's the bass?\nBring the keys, oh my God\nTurn it up nigga, where's the bass?\nCould you bring the keys? Yeah\nTurn it up, nigga where's the bass?\nDrop the drums\nYo, bubble gum that Reese's Pieces\nYou're feelin' life, I'll mug your teachers\nI've got Muslims crawlin' on Jesus\nI fucked Kelly, where is Regis?\nFound Alicia, now she keyless\nCold as ice, and now I'm creamless\nMurdered every bod from my squad\nSo technically, now I'm teamless, O.F. is so prestigious\n",
