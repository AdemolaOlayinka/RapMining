    "lyrics": "I'm saying, you know, like\nAll I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down\nYou know, like, you know, grow up!\nDon't grow down, grow out\nYou go from being a kid, doing your thing, hanging out with friends\nMonths later you're world famous\nYou're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it\nYou know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler\nFuck you Tyler!\n\nWatch me get this money nigga, tired of being hungry nigga\nNothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'mma punch a nigga\nNever made of plastic, I'm a savage, you look lunch my nigga\nPassing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga\nWe ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no mollies, bitch\nI'm hockin', spitting got some niggas out here poppin' ollie switch\nBuncha novices, Odd Future the squad, its thick\nThem young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense\nWe the last of a dying breed\nAnd we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs\nYou stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please\nMy pocket's solid, making profit off the highest tees\nBitch, twerk as I get on the verse, cursin'\nNigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person\nWatch me get this money, I'm up when the bird's chirpin'\nMake actions, fuck rehearsing\n\nNigga, summer, fall, winter-time, 24/365\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time\nFlying out at any time, getting money, any grind\nYou niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine\n\nIn a world where kids my age are popping mollies with leather\nSitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather\nCan name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether\nOr not they got one, tried to change their life for the better\nI was a drama club kid, I'd run with a fun dip, my nuts itched\nI was defiant, always said, \"Fuck shit\"\nHated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one\nAlso hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some\nSee I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's\nAnd I be gassin' in my buzz like some bees in a Shell\nFucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele\nAnd bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some braille\nI bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well\nI tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself\nThese fucking rappers got stylist, it's cause they can't think for themselves\nSee, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but\nReally, boy? Posers looking silly boy\nI'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi\nNot a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is (Diddy Riese)\nNa'kel Smith. Transworld page 64\nPoppin' like oil, ollies, and fire flames\nI'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game\nThe fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name\nI'm 'bout as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes\nBut he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hate dentists\nGod damn menace, 666 and he's not finished\nAnd my shit's missing, he hates women, but loves kittens\nSee y'all niggas trippin' man\nLook at that article that says my subject matter is wrong\nSaying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs\nLook at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me\nThough I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat\nLook at the kid who had the 9 and tried to blow out his mind\nBut talk is money, I said, \"Hi,\" I guess I bought him some time\nLook at the ones in the crowd. That shit is barnacles, huh?\nThey thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?\nBut then again, I'm an athiest that just worships Satan,\nAnd it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements\nAnd MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing\nBruh, they never played it, I just won shit for their fucking ratings\n\"Analog\" fans are getting sick of the rape\nAll the \"Tron Cat\" fans are getting sick of the lakes\nBut what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints\nBut I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank\nOver and over, shit, who gives a fuck what I think?\nMy fans don't think turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct\nFuck buying studio time. I'mma go purchase a shrink\nRecord the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch\n\n\nThis shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering.\nSo much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me\nBut Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump you fucking pussy?)\nI'm seeing it's a drop in my occular, jumping like they told me\nThat the 40's half off, like you know that cliff.\nDon't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot).\nOr get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids\nSo maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you).\nMalt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and\nAll of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!).\nDirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs\n(Oh, shut the fuck up!).\n\nSamuel's here!\nWhere's Wolf?\nFucking faggot.\nSalem was mine, bitch!\nWas that good enough, you fucking pussy?\n",
