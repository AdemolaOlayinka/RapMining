Hated by everyone thats the way it seems\nI don't know whats shorter, his damn temper or my self esteem\nI sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone\nBecause none of the cool kids would let me join a team\nDepression on the stalk again\nMy best friend is an inhaler because it will not let me cough\nWhenever I am losing Oxygen, bully hand around my neck\nBecause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again\nI brought that on myself, see I should know my place\nBut not at lunchtime, see\nI know better then to show my face around them\nBut the day I do it will be everywhere\nWhen I share these feelings Finally they gon' fucking care\n\nGrab a couple friends, start a couple riots\nCrash a couple\nGather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers\nOdd future hooligans causing up a ruckus\nIts Us. Nigga.\nI said its us, nigga.\n\nMurder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you\nWas when I... \"uh\" with all them burners, you\nThink that I'm some punk bully bitch who ain't gone trouble you\nWell I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind umm\n\"Who are you again?\" I'm Sammy and thats Tyler\nAnd we came to get wild and style in these trench coats!\nDon't start asking whats packin in these trench coats!\nBut just know if you start acting I'm grabbin for these trench coats!\nMy step-father called me a fag, I'll show him a fag\nI'll light a fire up in his ass\nAnd recently them assholes that be fuckin' with me in class.\nSo I'mma keep them motherfuckers there and make sure they pass Huh.\nMy prom date, she distance my offer\nSo I'mma and toss her in the principles office\nOh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend?\n(Yeah but my parents)\nOh don't worry you will probably never see them again\n\n\nBum bum bo bum bum\nBum bum bum bum bum\nBum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum\nBum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe\nWe are the Sams, and we're dead its just four of us\nWe come in peace we mean no harm and we're inglorious\nWe took their heads but we just took back what they took from us\nI guess we lost ours\n\nMusic had nothing to do with my final decision\nI just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention\nBut nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had\nSince I was a kid but I'm growing up so they missin'\nI didn't mean to hurt anybody I'm sorry\nI wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the army\nI'm hardly ever angry, roger rabbit framed me\nMomma I'm the same fucking kid that you made see?\nI don't wanna go to jail I just wanna go home\nAnd I want those fucking kids at school to just leave me alone\nAnd I... I hear helicopters make them dip\nI'm fucking reloaded I told you all that I ain't takin' shit\nYou better backup before this mac starts to lift up\nI'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up\nThe difference between us and our class is tan khakis\nI got 99 problems and all of them is being happy\n",
