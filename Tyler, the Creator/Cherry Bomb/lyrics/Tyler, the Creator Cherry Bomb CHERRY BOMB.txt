Tyler, the Creator
Cherry Bomb
2015)
I really made this song just so I could perform it
I don't even know how to perform it
Aw, nah
Boy don't cut that wood
Found out his flowers don't smell that good
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need anybody else's nose to win
Look, I am a god
No, I don't pray to society
All you other niggas wear camouflage
I'm in a field wearing pink and blue
What weak niggas see me?
Nigga, Young creators will scream with me
Nigga, you ain't got drive you just beep-beep 
They wanna talk shit from the back seat
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off
Let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Float in the air
It's cherry bomb
You muthafuckas want wolf, then come get it
You muthafuckas want wolf, they don't want wolf
(Muthafuckas!) Just take me to the gun store
I don't got enough time for you bum ass niggas
I choke your dad, hit your mom, cuz I don't know that nigga
Come and light my fire, I'll blow your fuckin' face off
Nigga, I'mma goddamn pilot
And I decide when we gon' take off
Let's get it

Tie the knot
Kick the chair
Strangled in the air
It's cherry bomb
You muthafuckas want wolf?!
They're like "this that cherry bomb"
I'm a firecracker and I'm ready to blow
You fire me up, I lose control
