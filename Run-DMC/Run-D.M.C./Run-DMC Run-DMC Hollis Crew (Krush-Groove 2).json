So I can see\n\nHuh-huh\n\nGot rhymes so def, rhymes, rhymes galore\nRhymes that you never even heard before\nNow if you say you heard my rhymes, we're gonna have to fight\nCause I just made the super-def rhymes last night\n\nMicrophone master, super rhyme maker\nI get def as the others get faker\nIt's me, D.M.C. in the place to be\nAnd I still got the same old harmony\nI'm the devastatin mic-controller\nThe word wizard and the chief rock roller\nBad b-boy made for the b-girls\nRock ruler rhymes as the turntable twirls\nSupreme being who was born to talk\nAnd over sucker MC's all day I walk\n\nA few years ago my name was Joe\nAnd then I went to a party, cold stole the show\nStole it as sure as birds have wings\nNow they're callin me DJ Running Things\nGot Kurtis Blow down with the two\nAnd my man Larry Lah makes beats for you\nKeepin up the funky beat is the Hollis Crew\nSo Dee, take the mic cause you know I'm through\n\nIn case you wonder what all this means\nWe're funky fresh from Hollis, Queens\nRun and Kurt both down with me\nAnd that's the way it's meant to be\nI'm the microphone master D.M.C.\nDevastatin mic-controller personality\nAnd to the sucker MC's who did not learn\nIf you don't this time we shall return...\n",
