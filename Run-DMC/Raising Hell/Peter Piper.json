Nimble what nimble and he was quick\nBut Jam Master cut faster Jack's on Jay's dick\nNow Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep\nAnd Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep\nAnd Alice chillin somewhere in Wonderland\nJack's servin Jill a bucket in his hand\nAnd Jam Master Jay's making out our sound\nThe turntables might wobble but they don't fall down\n\nNow Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing\nBut Jam Master's gettin loose and D.M.C.'s the king\nCause he's adult entertainer\nChild educator\nJam Master Jay king of the crossfader\nHe's the better of the best best believe he's the baddest\nPerfect timin when I'm climbin I'm a rhymin apparatus\nLot of guts\nWhen he cuts\nGirls move their butts\nHis name is Jay hear the play he must be nuts\nAnd on the mix real quick and I'd like to say\nHe's not Flash but he's fast and his name is Jay\n\nJay's like King Midas as I was told\nEverything that he touched turned to gold\nHe's the greatest of the greater get it straight\nHe's great\nPlaying fame cause his name is known in every state\nHis name is Jay\nTo see him play\nWill make you say\nGod damn that DJ made my day\nLike the butcher the baker\nThe candlestick maker\nHe's a maker a breaker\nAnd a title taker\nLike the little old lady who lived in a shoe\nIf cuts were kids he would be you\nNot lyin y'all he's the best I know\nAnd if I lie my nose will grow\nLike a little wooden boy named Pinocchio\nAnd you all know how the story go\n\nTricks are for kids he plays much gigs\nHe's a big bad wolf and you're the three pigs\nHe's a big bad wolf in your neighborhood\nNot bad meaning bad but bad meaning good\n\nWe're Run-D.M.C. got a beef to settle\nD's not Hansel he's not Gretel\nJay's a winner\nNot a beginner\nHis pockets get fat others get thinner\nJump on Jay like cows jump moons\nPeople chase Jay like dish and spoon\nAnd like all fairy tales end\nYou'll see Jay again my friend\n",
