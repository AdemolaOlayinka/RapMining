DUMB GIRL!\n\n\nI wish I knew, why a girl like you\nwants to do all the things that you do\nI know you want a man, but you should understand\nthat J.C. ain't D, you shouldn't be his fan\nYou're not this fine, you're out of your mind\nAnd I wrote this rhyme just for your kind\nDon't be misled, remember what I said\nThe rhymes of rappers surely knock some sense in your head\nDUMB GIRL.. DUMB GIRL!\n\n\n(NOW..) Now you're the flyest girl, in the whole school\nbut they don't call you fly - they call you fool\nBecause you don't go to class, you will not pass\nYou like to go but you should slow because you're goin too fast\nAnd I can tell that you're dumb when you walk in the place\nWalkin round with your thumb cold stuck in your face\nAlways sinnin never winnin cause you're last in the race\nYou get high and tell a lie and think that makes you the ace\nDUMB GIRL.. (stupid!) THE GIRL IS..\n\n\nNow you're a stupid sex fiend, with no will power (POWER)\nHit four guys in the bathroom at your last baby shower\n\n\nAll the guys call you fast (FAST) but I call you slow (SLOW)\nAlways sniffin or givin (GIVIN) somebody a blow (BLOW)\nGivin every guy a try (TRY) at the wink of an eye (EYE)\nThere's somethin that you're missin, that money can't buy (BUY)\nWhen it comes to love, you're even hated by Cupid (CUPID)\nYou're (silly) dilly (dumb) and you're JUST PLAIN STUPID!\nDUMB GIRL.. (stupid!) DUMB GIRL!\n\n.. the girl is ..\n\n\nI hope you to listen to the words, that I speak\nI'm not playin, what I'm sayin, can never be weak\nYou should use your brain, but you don't have one\nAnd when it comes to sense you don't have none\nYO YO you should know where I'm comin from\nBut you're just dumb (diddy) dumb (diddy diddy) DUMB DUMB!\n\nDUMB GIRL!\nDumb with a capital D!\nDUMB GIRL!\nStupid as can be, BREAKDOWN!\n\n.. the girl is ..\n\nDUMB GIRL! DUMB GIRL!\n.. the girl is dumb!\n",
