Now bass up, pick the pace up\nJam Master blastin through the plaster cause I has ta\nHard rocks like to rock it, you can't stop it\n?? Poll in ten years, I'ma walk away a prophet ??\nYou don't stop, I stop styles in the attic\nKick the fat flavor that you can't be mad at\n?? what's the matter, more mix in granny's batter\nRun-D.M.C.'s fatter, so kill the chit-chatter\nZigga zigga Jay, jigga jigga pump pump\nGettin bigger Babe Pah, figure nigga freak the funk\n3 in the Head, ten yards to go\nBlow up the spot for those that forgot\nStay stable as a navel, try an' rhyme rough and able\n(With the Baldhead Kidz!)
