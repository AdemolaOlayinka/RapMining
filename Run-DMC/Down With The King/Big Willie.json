I made my mind I come to con ya\nI see females I tell them yo my word is bond huh\nLike Terri Teresa Tammi Tawana Tarena and Tonya\nI'm comin hard I got your head and yeah the lock's on\nI threw you up, why did your daddy ?? cock strong\nI rock I wreck I rip a rhyme I ??\nMy rap is right I write a rip-and-ready rock song\n\n\nCall on the brother to come and get dumb\nuntil the def drum come as they come, when they come\nI said I rip some, tearin them up, a big up\nA whattup? A nigga, a so what, yeah put your bricks up\nI knock down the walls because I got to\nThe rock sound because I hip-hop new\nNot the old, gold, from around the neck\nAnd when I grab ahold you give me nuff respect\nIn a black BM, with my contact lens\nWhen the track begins, I'm setting new rap trends\nLettin lyrics I lay down\nYou play loud I stay proud with Jay down you stay down\nGet up on the truck song, the one you put your buck on\nYou're stuck on, you're luck on, you're sucked on\na lollipop SUCKA\nI snuck ya, I struck ya, you stupid mother..\n\n\nI gotta come my name is Run and me and D we been appointed\nI'm ever so clever you never TOUCH the annointed\nI'm Born Again I got a friend the Lord I rearrange\nbut other than that I'm livin fat and ain't NUTHIN changed\nBig Willie still in your grilly, you better block son\nI bust you up and then I blast you with my Bop Gun\nA million times rhyme risin to the prime\nwhile another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme\nBe instead I'd rather leave another brother dead\ncause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread\nI'm makin papers, brothers catchin vapors\nTry to lick shot, you get got, catch you later\nThis ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World\nWe're livin inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl\nSo check the hypness, I'm not livin like this\nI'm the type of guy to bust your eye, you lose your whiteness\nYou comin butt when you wish upon a star\nbut I could never be butt, so yo, bust the guitar!\n\n\n\n\nHeads up my brother, here comes another\nword to the verb the urge to discover\na lover, you hover, you smother, my brother\nYou can't do nothin other than take the record out the cover\nYou get the song at it's strong and randomn flow\nYou sing along cause the words you heard you know\nHostyle the style that style is wild\nThe penile is where I goes and smile\nBecause I pop a lot, they try to lock me up\nBecause I rock the block, they try to stop me up\nBut I'm sly as a fox I can rocks\nI got smarts when they starts tradin shots they get dropped\nI pull my card I pull my card I pull my card NOT\nI use the rock to be hard, I'm a hard rock\nYou get a speedknot, and then you bleed a lot\nYou better read a lot because you really need a lot of\ninformation, and some education\nCause I'm replacin what you hearin on your station\nDarryl is a Mack, Joe is in the Public\nJason leads the nation and I know you're gonna love it, Jay!!\n",
