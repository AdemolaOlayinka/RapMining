Darryl Mack, you're all of that\nThey pray they can save the crazy rat\nThey attack to mack to move him off the map\ncould never tell I fell, to hell and back\nIt's beautiful -- the mic makes hits\nto the dirty, stinkin, son of a.... (auuuuuuhh)\nI'm mad and glad and sad and highly upset\nSo don't do nothin that you might regret\nCause I'll stomp that ass, like a little insect (c'mon)\nclean off my kicks (c'mon) clean off my kicks (c'mon)\nclean off my kicks and then STEP!\n(stiggidy-stick, step!)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo they all rolled over and one fell out\nWe put two in the head\nand the little one said, roll over, roll over!\n\"Do or die!\"\nWe put two in the head\nand the little one said..\n\n\nNow c'mon step to me do me pursue me you never knew me\nYou'll be sleepin and you slept on the step\nAnd now your crew be sweatin me like you're sweatin the sweat\nAnother groupie dissin D, now you're back on the set\nI'm makin em takin em breakin em all\nDiss em one by one\nYou make the mistake of thinkin I'm soft\nThinkin Run ain't the one\nFrom eighty-three and they be seein me and D and they front\n?? the suckers from the ruckus that's about to become\nReel it back, come REWIND it's about that time\nFeelin wack, ate the swine it's about that swine\nin your body couldn't keep up at the end of the set\nBet ya beat ya that I teach ya and you're stuck until death\n(That's what I'm sayin)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe put two in the head\nand the little one said\nWe put one in the head\nand the little one said, roll over, roll over!\n\"Do or die!\"\n\n\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do.. or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\" \"Do..\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\"\n\"Do or die!\" ..\n",
