Yo, yo\nAiyyo I seen Run with the chrome spinnin\nWatchin the Knicks in the back of the 6\nPulled up on the side like, \"Who's winnin?\"\nNigga said, \"Me since eighty-three, get it right\"\nPolitely flashed his Roley, then dipped to the light\nNext night seen him on stage with some platinum shells\nwith baguettes on the side that spelled \"Raising Hell\"\nI said, \"Run the crowd yell like you paid 'em well\"\nThen he said to ask Bertha Dell, who the hell?\nOh well - I thought I was done bein impressed\nuntil my man called me up and told me listen to Flex\n{\"Yo yo yo, turn on Flex\"} I ain't know what to do\nIt was like Run was sunnin everybody but then again the shit was true\nMC's must want him gone, hoppin on chrome\nsayin they the kings, please, you kept the seat warm\nAin't nobody better than this twenty year veteran\nEven as a Reverand, hotter than you ever been\nIt don't really matter who the hell you are\nThe fakest of all cats or the biggest of stars (uh-huh)\nTryin to doubt these three, you breakin the law\nThey the kings, LEAVIN Y'ALL IN AWE, THAT'S REAL PAW\n\n\nLike ahhh, Dunn done did it again\nAhhh, pad done hit the pen\nAhhh, man they droppin gems\nAhhh, the kid's bout stackin the ends\n\n\nYo, Rev. Run, run the block, swerve the Dat'\nFlow is hot, don't need no gun to cock\nI'm sick of Vidal, your brother tried to get me to fall\nI'm kickin it raw, even in the thick of it all\nRun laps around wack cats, I hate DAT's\nSince way back, made great tracks, I lace raps\nYo face that, before you catch aluminum bats\nfrom numerous cats with Run-D.M.C. on they hats\nYou ain't gettin no show 'til your album out\nThe label don't wanna spend money yo what's THAT about?\nNo clout, had to settle for a fake amount\nWhile my catalogue bigger than your bank account\nNo doubt, I'm the greatest all time fo' sho'\nRev. Run comin through and leavin niggaz in awe\n\n\n\nYo Run remember that night at the light in the back of the 6?\nYeah I was mad the Knicks lost, I got a new whip\nYeah I see, the Bentley Arnage, with the four doors\nWhat is that, for more horse?\nNah son, for more tours\nI see you've been peepin me for quite some time\nYo my bad\nAin't a thing, nigga I noticed you rhyme\nYo what a nigga gotta do to be more like you?\nA nigga like me ain't got a clue\nFirst things first I DJ, Run all the rappers\nActors, they want status\nBut they can't have this\nSince \"Krush Groove\" you been makin them papes\nA lot of rap movies been made since but most of them fake\nThanks for the compliment kid, now jump BACK in your car\nIt's the Reverand leavin niggaz in awe, that's real paw like\n",
