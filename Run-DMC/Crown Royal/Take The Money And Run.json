Nimble was nimble and he was quick\nWell Run-DMC is the kings of rock\nRolled to the top and then we never get dropped\nYou still have us chilling in 2001\nAnd me and D will take the money and run\n\n\nCome on take the money and run (run)\nCome on take the money and run, hey hey hey\nCome on take the money and run, that's what I say\nCome on take the money and run, hey hey hey\nCome on take the money and run, that's what I say\nCome on take the money and run, yeah yeah yeah\nCome on take the money and run, aha\nCome on take the money and run, hey hey hey\nHey hey hey\nHey hey hey\nHey hey hey\nThat's what I say\n",
