Just gimme a call\nI'm going to breeze..\n\n\n.. past the other MC's\nAnd D's rhymes'll flow like water\nThe wind, the rain, the hurricane, it's all the same\nWith rhymes in order\n\n\nAnd yo my name is Run, and yeah I'm all that\nSlap back the KING of the daddy mack's\nBut that ain't the news I choose to tell\nI gotta use the cruise that bruises well\nFor the grime you slime, you try to diss mine\nI put your head to bed, cause it's bedtime\nI knock out your teeth beneath your gums\nNow you're mumblin - you bum!\n(Turn out the lights Run!) Picture punks playin me close\nwhen I'm hard as hell, and that's all labelled SUCKERS\nWaitin for the King of Swing to bring\n\"Beats to the Rhyme,\" and yeah I'm runnin things\nNow that's the name of the phrase,\nso don't be amazed at the ways my rhyme displays\nYou gotta make the best of what you got to get to the top\nin hip-hop, you gotta diggy diggy don't STOP!\n\n\n\n\nThe ?? artist, hittin hardest, smartest\nProfessor, compressor, impressor to the lesser\nlow-life ?? of the mic\nI come CORRECT! (You surely right)\nThe atmosphere is clear when I appear\nHere to wax and tax an MC for mere pennies\nAnd if any, wanna get with D\nI crash and bash and smash his ass for free\nBlack man! Originating creating a beat\nI educate and straight from off the streets\nHARD, like a man was born to be\nIt just just happened in rap I was born to be\nKING, yeah me the king of the rock\nSo let's rock the spot and diggy don't STOP!\n\n\n\nFunky lyrics that you hear\nAS WE RELEASE THE MASTERPIECE THE MUSIC WILL CEASE\nand I'll put up the peace sign\n\n\nAnd I roll with soul and reach my goal, the story is told\nD's bold, and suckers'll fold\n\n\nAnd I'm Run my son the fun has just begun\nand some are slum, and make em sell til\ncrumbles crumb they hum, those fools will come\nAnd none have never done Run, Jay!\n\n\nD.M.C. the king is me and I be\nthe voice of black community\nSo be the unity inside of me, and we\nwill all agree about this - don't STOP!\n",
