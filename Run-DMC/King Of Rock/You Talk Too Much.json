You over there, I know about your kind\nYou're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9\nEverywhere that you go, no matter where you at\nI said you talk about this, and you talk about that\nWhen the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back\nYour mouth is so big, one bite would kill a Big Mac\n\nYou talk too much You never shut up\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never shut up\n\nYou talk about people, you don't even know\nAnd you talk about places, you NEVER go\nYou talk about your girl, from head to toe\nI said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow\n\nYou talk too much You never shut up!!\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never shut up\n\nYou're the instigator, the orator of the town\nYou're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown\nYou talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep\nHas anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap\n\nYou talk too much You never shut, up!!\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\nTalking is the one thing, that you can do best\nYou told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest\nYou never have the story, right and exact\nAnd then you always try to bore me, with your yakkity yak\n\nYou talk too much And then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\nEveryday you are out fighting someone in the street\nAnd you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat\nThen you wonder how, you got in this mess\nJust think of what you said, then take a guess\n\nYou talk too much You never shut up!\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\nYou're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good\nYou're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood\nThe Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell\nYou always come around, with a story to tell\n\nYou talk too much And then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\nSaid it's everybody's business that you love to mind\nAnd talkin to you, is like dropping a dime\nYou're spreading the word, like it is your job\nYou should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob\n\nYou talk too much And you never shut up\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never shut up!\n\nA big blabbermouth, that's what you are\nIf you were a talk show host, you'd be a star\nI said your mouth is big, size extra large\nAnd when you open it, it's like my garage\n\nYou talk too much And then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never shut up\n\nYou always like to gossip, just like a girl\nYou talk so damn much, it's outta this world\nWhen you're reincarnated, in your second life\nYou won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife\n\nYou talk too much Then you never shut up\nHe said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n\nSHUT UP!!!\nSHUT UP!!!\n\nTwenty-five hours, eight days a week\nThirteen months outta year, is when you speak\nI'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk\nWhy don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk\n\nYou talk too much Then you never shut up!\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\nYou talk too much You could be, out of breath\nYou talk too much Man you naggin me to death\nYou talk too much Tired of hearing you speak\nYou talk too much Eight days a week\nYou talk too much Then you never shut up\nI said you talk too much Why don't you ever SHUT UP!!!\nYou talk too much Then you never shut up!\nI said you talk too much Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!\n",
