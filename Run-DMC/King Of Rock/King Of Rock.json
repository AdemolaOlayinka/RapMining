    "lyrics": "I'm the king of rock, there is none higher\nSucker MC's should call me sire\nTo burn my kingdom, you must use fire\nI won't stop rockin' till I retire\n\nNow we rock the party and come correct\nOur cuts are on time and rhymes connect\nGot the right to vote and will elect\nAnd other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect\n\nThey called us and said we're gettin iller\nThere's no one chiller\nIt's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller\nAs one def rapper, I know I can hang\nI'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang\nRoll to the rock, rock to the roll\nDMC stands for devestating mic control\nYou can't touch me with a ten foot pole\nAnd I even made the devil sell me his soul\n\nNow we crash through walls, cut through floors\nBust through ceilings and knock down doors\nAnd when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box\nYou can hear our sound for blocks and blocks\nFor every living person we're a purple treat\nIt's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?\n\nNow we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool\nI'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule\nIt's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool\nIt's all brand new, never ever old school\n\nYou got the music in your body and you can't comprehend\nWhen your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend\nMusic ain't nothin but a people's jam\nIt's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band\n\nNow I walked on ice and never fell\nI spent my time in a plush hotel\nI stood on many stages, held many mics\nTake airplane flights, at huge heights\nSo all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please\nCause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds\nGot a song so strong, it's knocking down trees\nIs it hard to believe it's Run-DMC\n\nI am from, around the way\nAnd Run goes to school, every day\nAnd Jay plays the records he has to play\nAnd we get down with no delay, HEY!\nI rock the party with the words I speak\nAnd Run says the rhymes that are unique\nAnd Jay cuts the records every day of the week\nAnd we are the crew that can never be beat\nSo don't try to diss me, try to be my friend\nCause if you do, you'll get yours in the end\nThe rhymes we say, shall set a trend\nBecause a devestating rap is what we send\n\nEvery jam we play, we break two needles\nThere's three of us but we're not the Beatles\nMy name is Darryl, you can call him D\nYou can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC\nPeople always ask, \"DMC, what does it mean?\"\nD's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean\n\nLike we said before, we rock hardcore\nI'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw\nAnd now we got the knack, to attract\nOur rhyme's an aphrodisiac\nWe'll reign on your brain and rock your knot\nWhen it comes to rock, give it all we got\nTo be MC's, we got what it takes\nLet the poppers pop and the breakers break\nWe're cool cool cats, it's like that\nThat's the way it is, so stay the hell back\nWe're causin hard times, for sucker MC's\nCause they don't make no songs like these\nPERIOD!\n",
