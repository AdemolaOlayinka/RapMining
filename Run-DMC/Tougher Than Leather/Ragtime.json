Jay to the telly music, loud as hell\nHe said - \"Hold up Run,\" , \"it's the bell!\"\nJay to the door as he leaves the cut\nfor his eyes a surprise, \"D.M.C. WHASSUP?\"\n\n\nI need a little help Jay, I got a little problem\nA guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em\nI only want to know why this happens all the time\n(What?) Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme\nI rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)\nI rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)\nI rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake\nWhen I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake\nI just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny\nA song about the line so long they all gave me their money\nThat's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)\nSaid maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do..\n\n\nHmmmm.. yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made\nAnd we'll go to the bank, AND WE CAN ALL GET PAID!\n\n\nCruisin down the block, in the sixty-six Olds\nGirls are on the jock like the ride was a Rolls\nFeelin kinda great, got change for the toll\nSuckers gotta wait, that's your fate, poor soul\nHeard you on the records and I heard you on the tapes\nStop, switch the conversation over to grapes, because\nyou're not bustin none, so stop fussin son\nYou're not down with Rush, they call us Russ and Run\nSince that's the company, you won't be chumpin me\nHere's the man, ask that fan (Run big brother D!)\n",
