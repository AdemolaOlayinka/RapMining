I'm\nRough and tough, cold huff and puff\nDon't bluff the stuff, got enough to rough\nGo long and on, no longer song\nGo on and on just for past the dawn\nPut preach and teach, with a speech to reach\nall streets and each, with beats for treats\nGot the King Supreme, may seem the clean\nwith a beat and a ring, no dream machine\nNot a gang to bang, out to hang with slang\ntalking yang and tang, about everythang\nJust brothers and others, like fathers and mothers\nwho discovered they love us they think that I've been above us\nNo crime or time, just rhyme and I'm\nfull grown and own, no phone or dime\nJust cut the stuff, til you get enough\ncause we're rougher than tougher and rougher tougher than tough!\n\n\n\n\nAh with a voice like thunder, words of wonder\nover all standin tall and the suckers fall under\nPosessed with power, cowards will cower\nDucks we devour hour hour after hour\nThree man riot, you can't deny it\nWe're so ill that you can't defy it\nGonna live, POSITIVE, forever, AND EVER\nRun-D.M.C. and we're \"Tougher Than Leather\"\n",
