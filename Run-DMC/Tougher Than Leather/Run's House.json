D.M.C complete!\n\n\n\nget on the mic and (emcee)\n\nAnother time I take\nFor the rhyme I make\nMake me mad and sad because the fad is fake\nSee I do this thing so come presue this king\nOne mind I rhyme so all you just bring\nCus I'm the best I'm def\nAsk the rest they left\nThat's my name my game and we don't need the rep\nSo keep the booze you loose and suckas cool your mouth\nI set a trap for rap thats crap\nIt's Run's house!\n\n\n\n\nSome underestimate\nAnd miscalculate\nMy intent to create what I call the great\nTill I make a song that I prove em wrong\nSee my song so strong it'll make 'em come along\nCome in the door\nGet on the floor\nHard rock hard hitting hip-hop hard-core\nCausing casualties and catastrophes\nAnd tragedies for the suck emcees\nUse a strategy to get the best of me\nYou dirty rat emcees\nWhoever you may be\nYou need to go down south\nYou need to shut your mouth\nIt's all about no doubt just shout cus we turn it out!\n",
