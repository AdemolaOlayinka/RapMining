WAS HER NAME!\nMISS ELAINE! WAS HER NAME!\n\nShe walked into the class with an aim for the day\nElaine had a game and I was willing to play\nShe said if I was down, she'd give me an A\nMISS ELAINE!\n\nYo, my class is breakin fool, she sent them all home\nShe kept me after school, yeah me all alone\nI follow all the rules, but I should have known\nMISS ELAINE!\n\nMISS ELAINE! WAS HER NAME!\nMISS ELAINE! WAS HER NAME!\n\nAhhhhhhhh...\n\n\nTry to go to school, keep my head on the books\nMy teacher's kinda cool, give the dirtiest looks\nAll my friends want a hook-up, but nobody hooks\nMISS ELAINE!\n\nYo, I go for what I know, and I get what I get\nIt's gettin rather frantic, people say I'm a pet\nShe's makin me a winner and I'm glad that I met\nMISS ELAINE!\n\nMISS ELAINE! WAS HER NAME!\nM_M_M_M_M_MISS ELAINE! MISS ELAINE!\n\nAhhhhhhh, make it funky now\n",
