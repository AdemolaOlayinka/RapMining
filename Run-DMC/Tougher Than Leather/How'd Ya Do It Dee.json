DJ Run\nBut in the summer's a bummer, cause I leave em at home\nJust Adidas and me, and ? and D on the phone\nDiggin eyein the crown, sellin skills by the pound\nMakin breakin and takin all of the suckers around\nPuttin fear in the heart, at the top of the chart\nStunning gunning and funning, cause Run's running this art\nDJ's facing the rage, never losing a show\nCause when the set is a match, then they're ready to go\nSwervin curvin deservin, the grass grow everyday\nCause makin money ain't funny, ain't that right JMJ?\n\n\nFull in effect, set comin correct\nYet gainin respect, still breakin a neck\n\n\nI'm coolin and chillin, not foolin with illin\nOn the mission it's thrillin, and I'll make a killin\nMy higher desire, go high and then fly ya\nMakes me the messiah, I'll neve rretire\nI'm spankin and bankin, high rankin and skankin\nImprovising, suprising, I'm rising and flaking\nMy boys on the side, the front and the back\nA Cadillac and a stack, for the King Darryl Mack\nNot workin for free, pocket full with a G\nAnd they always ask me, D.M.C., \"How'd ya do it Dee?\"\nOn the go with Joe, makin pay with Jay\nAll day, WHY? Cause I'm livin that way\nOne wonders, WHAT? How it gets done\nI hear questions, FROM WHO? From everyone\nI'm cool.. I broke the rule\nBreakin all but laws, when I break fool\nCause I'm the man.. that was born to rule\nevery girl in the world, and make them drool\nIt's easy to be, it's easy to D\nIt's easy to G, it's easy to me\nWanna know how I do it, got a goal, I pursue it\nGot the soul, to get to it, you was told, so you knew it\nThe answers, from questions, I'm tellin to thee\nCause they always ask me, D.M.C., \"How'd ya do it Dee?\"\n",
