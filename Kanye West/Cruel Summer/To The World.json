Pulled up in the A-V-entador\nAnd the doors, raise up, like praise the Lord\nDid the fashion show, and a tour, and a movie, and a score\nThis a ghetto opera, Francis Ford Car Coppola\nI need a new crib to hold my plaques, Rick Ross had told me that\nSaid I'd be all up in Goldman Sachs\nLike, \"These niggas tryna hold me back\nThese niggas tryna hold me back\", I'm just trying to protect my stacks\nMitt Romney don't pay no tax, Mitt Romney don't pay no tax\nChi-Town 'til I'm on my back, Chi-Town 'til I'm on my back\nOnly nigga in Beverly Hills, where the hell is Axle Foley at?\n\"Ease up there baby boy\", Ving Rhames told Jody that\nR. Kelly and the God of rap\nshitting on you, holy crap\n\nLet me see you put your middle fingers up\nTo the world, to the world, to the world\nTo the world, to the world, to the world\nLet me see you put your middle fingers up\nMiddle fingers up!\n\nI could give it all up, but it's not enough\nAy ay, here you go, my middle finger\nTo the world, to the world, from the ground to the moon\nHere's to the mountains, yeah here's to the room\nGive it up, give it up, won't let you deny me\nMakin' you love me, makin' you love me\n",
