Yeezy let Manhattan in\nGet my mic right, turn my levels up\nGet the light right, turn my bezel up\nYou hear the bounce on it, go and throw your mouth on it\nSo many ghosts in my garage they think my house haunted\nLong as my buckle say Hermes, the rumors I'm not concerned with\nThey wanna garnish my earnings before I send it I burn it\nYou know them people too convinced that my money's gettin' rinsed\nHer Louis seven inch, they TMZ me through my tint\nI bumped into Loon he like, \"Well, as-salamu alaykum\"\nYou know I ain't Muslim my nigga, I'm about my bacon\nThe shot niggas takin' you'd think I'm rollin' 'round with Reagan\nA Mexican landscape and come rake in what I'm makin'\nThink you blew me up with your bougie butt\nBut you ain't slow me up, I'm on the charts, you move me up\nI'm like a drug overlord, my jewelry's overboard\nIt's hard to believe dollar sign e-even know the Lord\nAlready wrote it off, so just ignore the cost\nSo when I'm rollin' off I'm showin' off with no remorse\nSh'mon\n\nWe buzzin', yeah\nHigher than a motherfucker\nHigher than a motherfucker\nHigher than a motherfucker, yeah\n\nbitch hold smoke longer\nChoke hold so strong, broke your armor\nNow you're wide open, right?\nYou ain't even smokin' right\nbitch hold the smoke\nCough hope, Harpo\nGotcha knocked out, now you know you're smokin' loud\nYou're higher than a motherfucker\nHigh in this bitch, high as a motherfucker\nI'm high and this bitch fine as a motherfucker\nI'm high as a motherfucker\nI hear sirens, she dying in this motherfucker\nMoment of silence for this motherfucker\nI'm just higher than a motherfucker\nI'm higher than a motherfucker\nI'm higher than a mother-\n",
