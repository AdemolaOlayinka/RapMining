No! No! N-No!\"\nI'm not loving you, the way I wanted to\nSee I wanna move, but can't escape from you\nSo I keep it low, keep a secret code\nSo everybody else don't have to know\n\n\nSo keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nKeepin' your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYou lose\n\n\nI'm not lovin' you the way I wanted to\nI can't keep my cool, so I keep it true\nI got somethin to lose, so I gotta move\nI can't keep myself, and still keep you too\nSo I keep in mind, when I'm on my own\nSomewhere far from home, in the danger zone\nHow many times did I tell ya fo it finally got through\nYou lose, you lose\nI'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to\nSee I had to go, see I had to move\nNo more wastin' time, you can't wait for life\nWe're just wastin' time, where's the finish line\n\n\nSo keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nKeepin' your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYou lose\n\n\nI'm not lovin you, the way I wanted to\nI bet no one knew, I got no one new\nI know I said I'm through, but got love for you\nBut I'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to\nGotta keep it goin', keep the lovin' goin'\nKeep it on a roll, only God knows\nIf I be with you, baby I'm confused\nYou choose, you choose\nI'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to\nWhere I wanna go, I don't need you\nI've been down this road, too many times before\nI'm not lovin' you, the way I wanted to\n\n\nSo keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nKeepin' your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYour love locked down\nNow keep your love locked down\nYou lose, you lose\nYou lose, you lose\nYou lose\n",
