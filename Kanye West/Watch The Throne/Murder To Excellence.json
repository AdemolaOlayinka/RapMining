What up cos?\nIt\u2019s all black, I love us\n\nThe paper read murder, black on black murder,\nThe paper read murder, black on black murder again\nBlack on black murder again\nBlack on black murder again\n\nIt\u2019s a celebration of black excellence\nBlack tie, black Maybachs\nBlack excellence, opulence, decadence\nTuxes next to the president, I\u2019m present\nI dress in Dries and other boutique stores in Paris\nIn sheepskin coats, I silence the lamb\nDo you know who I am Clarice?\nNo cheap cologne whenever I \u201cshh-shh\u201d\nSuccess never smelled so sweet, I stink of success\nThe new black elite, they say my black card bear the mark of the beast\nI repeat, my religion is the beat\nMy verse is like church, my Jesus piece, now please, domino, domino\nOnly spot a few blacks the higher I go\nWhat\u2019s up to Will, shoutout to O\nThat ain\u2019t enough, we gon\u2019 need a million more\nKick in the door, Biggie flow\nI\u2019m all dressed up with nowhere to go\n\nYea it\u2019s all messed up when it\u2019s nowhere to go\nSo we won\u2019t take the time out til we reach the T O P\nFrom paroles to hold G\u2019s, sold keys, low keys\nWe like the promised land of the OG\u2019s\nIn the past if you picture events like a black tie\nWhat\u2019s the last thing you expect to see, black guys\nWhat\u2019s the life expectancy for black guys?\nThe system\u2019s working effectively, that\u2019s why\nI\u2019ll be a real man, take care of your son\nEvery problem you had before this day is now done\nNew crib, watch a movie\nCause ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 on the news but the blues\nHit the mall, pick up some Gucci\nNow ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 new but your shoes\nSunday morning, praise the Lord\nYou the girl that Jesus had been saving me for\nSo let\u2019s savor this moment, and take it to the floor\nBlack excellence, truly yours\n",
