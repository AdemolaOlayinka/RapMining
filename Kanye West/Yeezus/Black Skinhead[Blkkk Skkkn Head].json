Fuck every question you asking\nIf I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists\nClaiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch\nFour in the morning, and I'm zonin'\nThey say I'm possessed, it's an omen\nI keep it 300, like the Romans\n300 bitches, where's the Trojans?\nBaby we livin' in the moment\nI've been a menace for the longest\nBut I ain't finished I'm devoted\nAnd you know it, and you know it\nSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go down\nI'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now\nBut there's nowhere to go, now\nAnd there's no way to slow down\nIf I knew what I knew in the past\nI would have been blacked out on your ass\nFour in the mornin', and I'm zonin'\nThey say I'm possessed, it's an omen\nI keep it 300, like the Romans\n300 bitches, where's the Trojans?\nBaby we livin' in the moment\nI've been a menace for the longest\nBut I ain't finished, I'm devoted\nAnd you know it, and you know it\nStop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit\nThis is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit\nI'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit\nI'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch\nBlack out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit\nThese niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit\nCome on, homie, what happened?\nYou niggas ain't breathing you gasping\nThese niggas ain't ready for action\n(Ready, ready for action)\nFour in the mornin', and I'm zonin'\nI think I'm possessed, it's an omen\nI keep it 300, like the Romans\n300 bitches, where's the Trojans?\nBaby we're livin' in the moment\nI've been a menace for the longest\nBut I ain't finished, I'm devoted\nAnd you know it, and you know it\nSo follow me up cause this shit's about to go down\nI'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now\nBut there's nowhere to go, now\nAnd there's no way to slow down\nIf I knew what I knew in the past\nI would've been blacked out on your ass\nGod\n",
