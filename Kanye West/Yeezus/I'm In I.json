Where?\n\nTime to take it too far now\nMichael Douglas out the car now\nThe kids and the wife life\nBut can't wake up from the night life\nI'm so scared of my demons\nI go to sleep with a nightlight\nMy mind move like a Tron bike\nPop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist\nI'm gonna start a new movement\nBeing led by the drums\nI'm a rap-lic priest\nGetting head by the nuns\nThey don't play what I'm playing\nThey don't see what I'm saying\nThey be balling in the D-League\nI be speaking Swaghili\n",
