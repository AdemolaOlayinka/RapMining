Who taught you how to get sexy for a nigga?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nYou never used to talk dirty, but now you got damn disgusting,\nMy, my God, where'd you learn that?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nLook at you motherfucking butt ass naked with these motherfucking Jimmy Choos off\nWho taught you how to put some motherfucking Jimmy Choos on?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nYo you took your game up a whole 'nother level, this is some Cirque 'u Soleil now!\nYou done went all porno on it, k. And I, and I love it..\nAnd I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!\nHow did you learn, how.. how did your game come up?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nI was fucking parts of your pussy I never fuck before\nI was in there like oo I never been here before. I've never even seen this part of town before.\nIt's like you got this shit re-upholstered or something. What the fuck happened?\nWho, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?\n(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)\nYou know what, I got to thank Yeezy.\nAnd when I see that nigga Imma thank him.\nImma buy his album, Imma download that.. Imma shoot a bootlegger!\nThat's how good I feel about this nigga\nOww, I still can't believe you got me this watch. This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted\nEven with the bezel this is the motherfucker I wanted. I saw this shit, I saw it\nTwista had this shit on in The Source. I remember, Twista had this motherfucker on in The Source\nThat's right, that's right! Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!\nWhere you learn to treat a nigga like this?\n(Yeezy taught me)\nYeezy taught you well, Yeezy taught you well.\n",
