Motherfucker, we rollin'\nWith some light skinned girls and some Kelly Rowland's\nIn this white man's world we the ones chosen\nSo goodnight cruel world I'll see you in the mornin',\nHuh? I see you in the mornin'\nThis is way too much, I need a moment.\n\nNo one man should have all that power\nThe clocks tickin'. I just count the hours\nStop trippin'. I'm tripping off the power\n'Til then, fuck that the world's ours\n21st century schizoid man\nFuck SNL and the whole cast\nTell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass\nMore specifically they can kiss my ass hole\nI'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes!\nYou short minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon\nMy furs is Mongolian,\nMy ice brought the goalies in\nI embody every characteristic of the egotistic\nHe knows, he's so fuckin' gifted\nI just needed time alone, with my own thoughts\nGot treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault\nMy child-like creativity, purity and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts\nReality is catching up with me, taking my inner child I'm fighting for custody\nWith these responsibilities that they entrust in me\nAs I look down at my diamond encrusted piece thinking...\n\nNo one man should have all that power\nThe clocks tickin' I just count the hours\nStop trippin' I'm tripping off the powder\n'Til then, fuck that the world's ours\n21st century schizoid man\nColin Powell, Austin Powers\nLost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation\nThey say I was the abomination of Obama's nation\nWell that's a pretty bad way to start a conversation\nAt the end of the day goddamn it I'm killin' this shit\nI know damn well ya'll feelin' this shit\nI don't need your pussy, bitch I'm on my own dick\nI ain't got a power trip who you going home with?\nHow 'Ye doin'? I'm surviving\nI was drinkin' earlier now I'm driving\nWhere the bad bitches huh? Where ya hidin'?\nI got the power make your life so excitin'...\nOh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey\nHey, hey\nNow this'll be a beautiful death\nI'm jumping out the window\nI'm letting everything go\nI'm letting everything go\n\nYou got the power to let power go flow\n\n21st century schizoid man\n",
