'cause i, i just needed some fresh air, you know what i'm\nsayin, 'cause i been there for a while, i appreciated what they did\nfor me, but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he\ngotta make a change, try to move up to the next level. and that day i\ncame and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay-z and he said, \"oh\nyou a real soulful dude\" . and he\nuh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time i got\nto the studio, you know how he do it, one take. and he said\n\"check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"\n\"tell me what you think of this.\" and i heard it, and i was thinking\nlike, man, i really wanted more like of the simple type jay-z, i ain't\nwant like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the, in my\npersonal opinion. so he asked me, \"what you think of it?\"\n\"so what you thinkin?\"\nand i was like, \"man that shit tite,\"\nyou know what i'm sayin', man what i'ma tell him? i was on the train\nman, you know. so after that i went back home. and man i'm, i'm just\nin chicago, i'm trying to do my thing. you know, i got groups. i got\nacts i'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like\npoppin' off the way it should have been. one of my homeys that was one\nof my artists, he got signed. but it was supposed to really go through\nmy production company, but he ended up going straight with the\ncompany. so, like i'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad\nnews that dude was tryin' to leave my company. and i got evicted at\nthe same time. so i went down and tracked the beats from him, i took\nthat money, came back, packed all my shit up in a u-haul, maybe about\nten days before i had to actually get out. so i ain't have to deal\nwith the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. me and my mother drove to\n\"come on, let's just go\"\nnewark, new jersey. i hadn't even seen my apartment.\ni remember i pulled up\n\"kanye, baby, we're here\",\ni unpacked all my shit. you know, we went to ikea, i bought a\nbed, i put the bed together myself. i loaded up all my equipment, and\nthe first beat i made was, uh, 'heart of the city.'\nand beans was still working on his album at that time, so i came up\nthere to baseline, it was beans' birthday, matter of fact, and i\nplayed like seven beats. and, you know i could see he's in the zone\nhe already had the beats that he wanted, i did nothing like already at\nthat time. but then jay walked in. i remember he had a gucci bucket\nhat on. i remember it like, like it was yesterday. and hiphop said\n\"yo play that one beat for him.\" and i played 'heart of the city.' and\nreally i made 'heart of the city,' i really wanted to give that beat to dmx.\n\"no i think jay gon' like this one right here\".\nand i played another beat, and i played another beat. and i remember that\ngucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of\nthem faces like 'ooooooooooh.' two days later i'm in baseline and i seen\ndame. dame didn't know who i was and i was like \"yo what's up i'm kanye.\"\n\"yo, you that kid, kanye?\"\n\"you that kid that gave all them beats to jay?\nyo, this nigga got classics\"\n\"jay got classics, g.\"\nyou know i ain't talkin shit.\ni'm like \"oh shit.\" and all this time i'm starstruck, man. i'm\nstill thinking 'bout, you know i'm picturing these niggaz on the show\nthe streets is watching, i'm lookin, these were superstars in my\neyes. and they still are, you know. so, jay came in and he spit all\nthese songs like in one day, and in two days... i gotta bring up one\nthing, you know, come back to the story, the day i did the 'can't be\nlife' beat on track, i remember lenny s, he had some louis vuitton\nsneakers on, he think he fly. and hiphop was there, i think tata, john\nminnelli, a bunch of people. i didn't know all these people at the\ntime they was in the room, and i said, \"yo jay i could rap.\" and i\nspit this rap that said, uh \"i'm killin y'all niggaz on that lyrical\nshit. mayonnaise colored benz, i push miracle whips.\" and i saw his\neyes light up when i said that line. but you know the west, the rap\nwas like real wack and shit, so that's all the response.\nhe said \"man that was tite.\"\n\"that, that was cool. that was hot.\"\nthat was it. you know, i ain't get no deal then, hehe.\nokay, fast forward.\nso, blueprint, h to the izzo, my first hit single. and i just\ntook that proudly, built relationships with people. my relationship\nwith kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my\ncareer as a rapper. because, you know, of course later he allowed me\nto go on tour with him. man, i appre-- i love him for that. and at\nthis time, you know i didn't have a deal, i had songs, and i had\nrelationships with all these a&r's, and they wanted beats from me, so\nthey'd call me up, i'd play them some beats. \"gimme a beat that sound\nlike jay-z.\" you know, they dick riders. whatever. so i'll play them\nthese post-blueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit. i'll\nbe like, \"yo but i rap too.\" hey, i guess they was lookin' at me crazy\n'cause you know, 'cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever\neverybody out there listen here. i played them 'jesus walks' and they\ndidn't sign me. you know what happened, it was some a&r's that fucked\nwith me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the\ncompany that'll say \"naw.\" like, dave lotti fucked with me, my\nnigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels. jessica rivera, man\n\"man, you niggaz is stupid if y'all don't sign kanye, for real.\"\ni'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\n\"y'all niggaz is stupid\". let's just say i didn't get my deal.\nthe nigga that was behind me, i mean,\nhe wasn't even a nigga, you know?\nthe person who actually kicked everything off was joe 3h from capitol\nrecords. he wanted to sign me really bad.\n\"we gonna change the game, buddy.\"\ndame was like, \"yo you got a deal with capitol,\nokay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\"you gotta make sure it's not wack.\"\nthen one day i just went ahead and played it, i wanted to\nplay some songs, 'cause you know cam was in the room, young guru, and\ndame was in the room. so i played... actually it's a song that you'll\nnever hear, but maybe i might use it. so, it's called 'wow.'\n\"i go to jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\ni got eleven plaques on my walls right now\nyou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\nlike the chorus went. don't bite that chorus, i might still use it. so\ni play that song for him, and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\"oh shit it's not even wack.\"\n\"i ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\"it's actually kinda hot.\"\nlike they still weren't looking at me\nlike a rapper. and i'm sure dame figured, 'like man. if he do a whole\nalbum, if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and\nsave the album, you know. so uh dame took me into the office, and he's\nlike \"yo man, we, we on a brick, we on a brick\"\n\"you don't wanna catch a brick\"\nyou gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\ni told hiphop and hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" actually, even with\nthat i was still about to take the deal with capitol 'cause it was\nalready on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3h. that, you\nknow, 'cause i told him i was gonna do it, and i'm a man of my word, i\nwas gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do. then, you know, i'm\nnot gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer\nrapper\" and told 3h that told the heads of the capitol, and right--\nthe day i'm talking about, i planned out everything i was gonna do\nman, i had picked out clothes, i already started booking studio\nsessions, i started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes\nman i was ready to go. and they had mel call me, they said\n\"yo... capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\"yo, capitol pulled out on the deal.\"\nand, you know i told them that rocafella was interested\nand i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying\nto gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. i went up... i\ncalled g, i said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with rocafella?\"\n",
