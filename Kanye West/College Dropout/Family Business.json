(all, all, all the things things)\nAw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?\n(all, all, all the glitter is not gold)\nYeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)\n(real is what you live to be)\n\n\nThis is family business\nAnd this is for the family that can't be with us\nAnd this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us\nThat's why I spit it in my songs so sweet\nLike a photo of your granny's picture\nNow that you're gone it hit us\nSuper hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right\nYeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be life\nSomebody please say grace so I can save face\nAnd have a reason to cover my face\nI even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it\nMonkey bread on the side, know how the family do it\nWhen I brought it why had guard have to look all to it?\nAs kids we used to laugh\nWho knew that life would move this fast?\nWho knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?\nAnd look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it\nAnd if you did, then that's family business\n\n\nAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)\nThey don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)\nAll these fancy things\nI tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold\nNow all I know I know all these things\n\n\nThis is family business\nAnd this is for everybody standin' with us\nCome on, let's take a family Grammy picture\nAbby, remember when they ain't believe in me?\nNow she like \"See, that's my cousin on TV\"\nNow, we gettin' it and we gon' make it\nAnd y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite\nI can't deny it, I'm a straight rider\nBut when we get together be electric slidin'\nGrandma, get 'em shook up\nAw naw, don't open the photo book up\nI got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name\nBut I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane\nYou know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude\nBut every holiday nobody eatin' her food\nAnd you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins\nGot roaches at their crib like them your first cousins\nAct like you ain't took a bath with your cousins\nFit three in the bed while six of y'all\nI'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg\nBut you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed\n\n\nRain, rain, rain go away\nLet the sun come out and all the children say\nRain, rain, rain go away\nLet the sun come out and all the children say\n\n\nI woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind\nA creative way to rhyme without usin' knives and guns\nKeep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God\nAnd keep your face to the risin' sun\nAll my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog\nAnd my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog\nI feel like one day you'll understand me dog\nYou can still love your man and be manly dog\nYou ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'\nSittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman\nWhy Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?\nThe second she storms out then he storms in\nY'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion\nAnd drink some wine like Communion\nAnd act like everything fine and if it isn't\nWe ain't lettin' everybody in our family business\n\n\n(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)\nThey don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)\nThey don't mean a thing\n(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)\nThey don't mean a thing, a thing\n\n\nAnd I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)\nThey don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)\nAll these fancy things\nI tell you that all (all the glitter) my weight in gold\nNow all I know I know all these things\n\n(oooh) All these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\nAll these things (oooh) all these things (these things)\n",
