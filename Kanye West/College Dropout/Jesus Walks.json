It's kinda hard\nGetting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method\nThey be asking us questions, harass and arrest us\nSaying, \"We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast.\"\nHuh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?\nWe ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases\nA trunk full of coke rental car from Avis\nMy mamma used to say only Jesus can save us\nWell mamma I know I act a fool\nBut I'll be gone 'til November I got packs to move I Hope\n\n(Jesus walks)\nGod show me the way because the Devil trying to break me down\n(Jesus walks with me)\nThe only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walks)\nAnd I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus walks with me)\nI want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long\nTo the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers\n(Jesus walks with them)\nTo the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah\n(Jesus walks with them)\nNow hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly\nI know he hear me when my feet get weary\nCause we're the almost nearly extinct\nWe rappers are role models we rap we don't think\nI ain't here to argue about his facial features\nOr here to convert atheists into believers\nI'm just trying to say the way school need teachers\nThe way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way I need Jesus\nSo here go my single dog radio needs this\nThey say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\nThat means guns, sex, lies, video tapes\nBut if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?\nWell if this take away from my spins\nWhich will probably take away from my ends\nThen I hope this take away from my sins\nAnd bring the day that I'm dreaming about\nNext time I'm in the club everybody screaming out\n(Jesus walks)\nGod show me the way because the devil trying to break me down\n(Jesus walks)\nThe only thing that that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now\n(Jesus walks)\nAnd I don't thing there's nothing I can do now to right my wrongs\n(Jesus walks with me... fades)\nI want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long\n",
