Well well well well well)\nShe said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition, some Minnie Ripperton, and definitely set this party off right\n(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be? Well well well well well)\n\n\nI told her to drive over in your new whip\nBring some friends you cool with\nI'm gonna bring the cool whip\nThen I want you to strip\nSee you is my new chick\nSo we get our grind on\nShe be grabbing, calling me Biggie like Shine home\nMan, I swear she fine homes\nWhy she always lying though\nTelling me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones\nShe got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson\nGot a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson\nI play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action\nMy dawg said you ain't no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong\nI'm a play this Vandross\nYou're gonna take your pants off\nI'm gonna play this Gladys Knight\nMe and you're gonna get right\n\n\n\n\nGot you looking at the gliss at my hands and wrists\nWhile I'm laying back smoking on my cannabis\nWhen it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther\nI can tell you ain't no messing with Kan-man and Twist\nFrom the Chi and I be\nSipping Hennessy\nPlay some R&B\nTrying to smoke a B\nLooking properly\nFeeling on a G?\nAnd always (well well well well well)\nCome with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne\nYou ain't know Twista can work it like the Whispers\nHit the stop light, get into some Isaac\nThe rims still moving so I'm bumping little spinners\nWhile I'm smoking on a B\nDipping through the streets\nBumping R&B\nAnd I got to leave\nsomething to the 23's?\nAnd I do it (well well well well well)\nWith my earth and the wind smoke a fire\nLet me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat\nPut you in a daze for maze\nFullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex\nYou ready for the world girl\nCome on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me\nAn every moment you controllin' me I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci\nAnd when I come over and bend your ass\nYou be bumping Teddy Pendergrass\nI'd hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow\nNow I gotta go up in it fast, but I'm gonna finish last\nNo matter how much of a thug you see\nI still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me\nAnd with some Luther come on and hope you finna and still be in love with me\n\n\n\n\nBaby drop another slow jam\nAnd all us lovers need hold hands\nAnd if you ain't got no man hop up in my Brougham\nI keep it pimping like an old man\nYou got to roll with the plan\nCause after that then I\nTake it to the dome\nThen I got to bone\nStay up in the zone\nGot to get you home\nGotta run up on\nAnd I do it (well well well well well)\nBaby drop another slow jam\nAnd all us lovers need hold hands\nAnd if you ain't got no man hop up on my brohem\nI keep it pimping like an old man\nYou got to roll with the plan\nCause after that then I\nTake you to my home\nAnd we could get it on\nDisconnect the phone\nJust to get you goin'\nTrying to make you moan\nAnd I do it (well well well well well)\n",
