We're assholes!\nThat's why we hear your music in fast forward\n'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no more\n\n\nNow who the hell is this?\nE-mailing me at 11:26, telling me that she 36-26, plus double D\nYou know how girls on black planet be when they get bubbly\nAt NYU but she hail from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chilling on campus\nSent me a picture with her feeling on Candice\nWho said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis\nW-H-I-T, it's getting late mami, your screen saver say tweet\nSo you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend\nHis name Kweli\n(You mean Talib, lyrics stick to your rib)\nI mean\n(That's my favorite CD that I play in my crib)\nI mean\n(You don't really know him, why is you lying)\nYou Kwe, she don't believe me, please pick up the line\nShe's gonna think that I'm lying, just spit a couple of lines\nThen maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high\n\nYeah, I can't believe this nigga use my name for picking up dimes\nBut never mind, I need some tracks you trying to pull tracks out\nAnd my rhymes is finna blow you trying to blow backs out\nWell OK, you twisted my arm, I'll assist with the charm, aiyyo\nAin't you meet that chick at that conference with your mom?\nShe's the bomb, but she got the boujee behavior\nAlways got something to say like an OK player hater\nAnyway, I don't usually fuck with the Internet\nOr chicks on Birth Control stuck to they arm like Nicorette\nYou really fucking that much, you trying to get off cigarettes\nAnd she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet\nI apologize if I come off a little inconsiderate\nI got the bubble kush and a sister could get a hit of it\n\nGet 'em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke\nA high filled with dope\nYou all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes\nThe real nigga quotes\nReal rappers is hard to find like a remote control,\nRap is not a used to but still got love,\nThat's why I abuse you who are not thugs\nRock clubs, it's like Tiger Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show\nCalled Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggas in you\nYou's a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you\nHow could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead\nI'm here to resurrect me, mosh is too sexy to even make songs like these\nThat's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys\nToo many featured MCs, and producers is popular\nTwelve thousand spins, nobody got to copping her\nAlbum, how come, you the hot garbage of\nThe year, It's clear your image is snooped up\nLabel got you souped up, telling you you're sick\nMan you a dick with a loose nut\nVideo hard to watch like Medusa\nEven your club record need a booster\nChimped up, with a pimp cup, illiterate nigga\nRead the infa, red across your head Imma bred King like Simba\nBoulder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a MC with a temper\nYou dancing for money like honey, I did this my way\nSo when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye\nSpitting through wires and fires, MCs retiring\nGot your hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then\n",
