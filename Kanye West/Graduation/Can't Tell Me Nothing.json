Act more stupidly.\nbought more jewelry, more Louis V, my momma couldn't get through to me.\nThe drama, people suing me,\nI'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.\nI'm just saying how I feel man,\nI ain't one of the Cosby's I ain't go to Hill man\nI guess the money should've changed him,\nI guess I should've forgot where I came from.\n\n\nLa, la, la, la wait till I get my money right\nla, la, la, la then you cant tell me nothing right\nExcuse Me, is you saying something?\nUh, uh, you can't tell me nothing\n(Ha ha) you can't tell me nothing\nUh, uh, you can't tell me nothing\n\nLet up the suicide doors.\nThis is my life homey, you decide yours.\nI know that Jesus died for us,\nBut I couldn't tell you who decide wars.\nSo I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways\nOld folks talking about back in my day\nBut homey this is my day.\nClass started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?\nYou know I already graduated\nAnd you can live through anything if magic made it.\n\nThey say I talk with so much emphasis,\nOh, they're so sensitive.\nDon't ever fix your lips like collagen\nSay something were you gone end up apologising.\nLet me know if it's a problem man,\nAlright man, holla then.\n\n\n\nLet the champagne splash, let that man get cash,\nLet that man get past.\nYou don't need a stop to get gas,\nIf he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cause\nHow he move in a room full of no's?\nHow he stay faithful in a room full of h**s?\nMust be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,\nSo when he buried in a tomb full of gold.\nTreasure. What's you pleasure?\nLife is a, uh, depending how you dress her.\nSo if the devil wear Prada,\nAdam Eve wear Nada,\nI'm in between, but way more fresher.\nWith way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,\nThat's when you die hard.\nYa homies looking like \"Why God?\"\nWhen they reminisce over you, my god.\n",
