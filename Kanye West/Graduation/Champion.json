Huh?\nI guess me if it isn't you\nLast week I paid a visit to the institute\nThey got the Drop Out keepin' kids in the school\nI guess I'll clean up my act like Prince'll do\nIf not for the pleasure, least for the principle\nThey got the CD then got to see me drop gems\nLike I dropped out of P.E.\nThey used to feel invisible\nNow they know they invincible\n\n(Did you realize\nThat you were a champion?\nIn their eyes)\nThis is the story of a champion\nRounders in the mob and they pop the guns\nStand up stand up! Here he comes\nTell me what it takes to be number one?\nTell me what it takes to be number one?\nThis is the story of a champion\nRounders in the mob and they pop the guns\nStand up stand up! Here he comes\nTell me what it takes to be number one?\nTell me what it takes to be number one?\n",
