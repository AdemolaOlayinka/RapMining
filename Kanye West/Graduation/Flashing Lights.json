Flashing lights, lights\nWhat do I know? Flashing lights, lights\n\n\nI know it's been a while,\nSweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing\nI know I was foul bay-bay,\na-bay late-ly you been all on my brain,\nAnd if somebody would've told me a month ago\nFronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know\nIf somebody would've told me a year ago\nit'd go, get this difficult\nFeeling like Katrina with no fema\nLike Martin with no Gina\nLike a flight with no visa\nFirst class with the seat back I still see ya\nIn my past, you on the other side of the glass\nOf my memory's museum,\nI'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,\ncome home you know you can't Rome without Caesar\n\n\nAs I recall, I know you love to show off\nBut I never thought that you would take it this far\nWhat do I know? Flashing lights, lights\nWhat do I know? Flashing lights, lights\n\nAs you recall, you know I love to show off\nBut you never thought that I would take it this far\nWhat do you know? Flashing lights, lights\nWhat do you know? Flashing lights, lights\n\nFlashing lights, lights\nFlashing lights, lights\n\n\nLights, lights, lights, lights...\n",
