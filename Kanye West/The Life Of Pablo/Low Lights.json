Some day the sky above will open up and he will reach out his hand and guide me through, oh yes he will.\nI won't always be crying these tears. I won't always be feeling so blue. Some day, he will open up the door for me and call my name.\nSome day he will. I don't know if anybody understands what that feels like.\nNo matter what you've been through or where you've been he's always there,\nwith his arms open wide accepting me for who I am and I love him so much, I couldn't do it without him I wouldn't want to.\nI'm crying now, it feels so good to be free, to be accepted for who you are and loved no matter what, oh lord thank you, you are the joy of my life.\n",
