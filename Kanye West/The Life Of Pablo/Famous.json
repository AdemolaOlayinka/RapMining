I made that bitch famous (God damn)\nI made that bitch famous\nFor all the girls that got dick from Kanye West\nIf you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best\nWhy? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)\nThey mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)\nHer man in the store tryna try his best\nBut he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh\nBut we still hood famous (God damn)\nYeah we still hood famous\n\nI just wanted you to know\nI loved you better than your own kin did\nFrom the very start\nI don't blame you much for wanting to be free\nWake up, Mr West! Oh, he's up!\nI just wanted you to know\n\nI be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'\nThat Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'\nShe be Puerto Rican day parade wavin'\nLast month I helped her with the car payment\nYoung and we alive, whoo!\nWe never gonna die, whoo!\nI just copped a jet to fly over personal debt\nPut one up in the sky\nThe sun is in my eyes, whoo!\nWoke up and felt the vibe, whoo!\nNo matter how hard they try, whoo!\nWe never gonna die\n\nI just wanted you to know\n\nBam bam, bam bam\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\n'ey what a bam bam\nHow you feeling right now? Let me see your lighters in the air\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nBam bam eh\nBam bam, bam bam\nLet me see your middle finger in the air\nBam bam, bam bam\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nLet me see you act up in this motherfucker\n'ey what a bam bam\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nHow you feelin', how you feelin, how you feelin' in this mother fucker, god damn\nBam bam\nOne thing you can't do is stop us now\nBam bam, bam bam\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nYou can't stop the thing now\n'ey what a bam bam\nMan it's way too late, it's way too late, it's way too late you can't fuck with us\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nBam bam, bam bam\nBam bam, bam bam\nTo the left, to the right\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\nI wanna see everybody hands in the air like this\n'ey what a bam bam\nBam bam, bam bam\nBam bam dilla, bam bam\n\nI just wanted you to know\nI loved you better than your own kin did\nFrom the very start\nI don't blame you much for wanting to be free\nI just wanted you to know\n",
