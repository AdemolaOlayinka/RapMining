More\nYou persecute the weak\nBecause it makes you feel so strong to save\nDon't have much strength to fight\nSo I look to the light, Lord\nTo make these wrongs turn right\nHead up high, I look to the light\nHey, cause I know that you'll make everything alright\nAnd I know that you'll take good care of your child\nOh, no longer am afraid of the night\nCause I, I look to the light\n\nWhen they come for you, I will shield your name\nI will field their questions, I will feel your pain\nNo one can judge\nThey don't, they don't know\nThey don't know\nFoot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea\nI'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia\nTreat the demons just like Pam\nI mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina\nI been this way since Arthur was anteater\nNow they wanna hit me with the woo wap the bam\nTryna snap photos of familia\nMy daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her\nYou can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille\nTubman of the underground, come and follow the trail\nI made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell\nI met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail\nHe said let's do a good ass job with Chance three\nI hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy\nLet's make it so free and the bars so hard\nThat there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet\nThis is my part, nobody else speak\nThis is my part, nobody else speak\nThis little light of mine\nGlory be to God, yeah\nI'mma make sure that they go where they can't go\nIf they don't wanna ride I'mma still give them raincoats\nKnow what God said when he made the first rainbow\nJust throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro\nUgh, I'm just having fun with it\nYou know that a nigga was lost\nI laugh in my head\nCause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt\nUgh, cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike\nYou cannot mess with the light\nLook at lil Chano from 79th\n\nWe on an ultralight beam\nWe on an ultralight beam\nThis is a God dream\nThis is a God dream\nThis is everything\nEverything\n\nYes, God\nHallelujah\nI'm tryna keep my faith\nYes, Jesus\nThat's it\nBut I'm looking for more\nSomewhere I can feel safe\nAnd end my holy war\n\nFather, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough.\nThis prayer's for everybody that feels like they're too messed up.\nFor everyone that feels they've said \"I'm sorry\" too many times.\nYou can never go too far when you can't come back home again. That's why I need...\nFaith, more, safe, war\n",
