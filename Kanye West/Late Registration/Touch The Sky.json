T-Top of the world)\nNow let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la\n(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)\nBack when Gucci was the shit to rock,\nBack when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,\nI'd do anything to say \"I got it\".\nDamn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.\nBefore anybody wanted K-West beats,\nMe and my girl split the buffet at KFC.\nDog, I was having nervous breakdowns,\nLike \"Damn, these niggas that much better than me?\"\nBaby, I'm going on an airplane,\nAnd I don't know if I'll be back again.\nSure enough, I sent the plane tickets,\nBut when she came to kick it, things became different.\nAny girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.\nI couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.\nI'm trying to write my wrongs,\nBut it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.\nNow,\n\nI gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly\nFor the day you die, You gonna touch the sky\n(You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot\nLooking extra fly\nFor the day you die, You gonna touch the sky\nYes, yes, yes guess who's on third?\nLupe steal like Lupin the Third.\nHear like ear till I'm beer on the curb\nPeach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge\nSlow it down like we're on the syrup\nBottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.\nBut, before you say another word,\nI'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street.\nI'm trying to stop lion like a Mum-Ra,\nBut I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.\nEngarge, touch\u00e9 Lupe cool as the unthawed\nBut I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.\nI come as correct as a porn star,\nIn a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.\nSo, I represent the first.\nNow, let me end my verse right where the horns are like\n\n\n(We back at home, baby)\nSky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nSky, Sky high\nI'm, I'm sky high\nYeah! (Keep it rolling)\n(Feels good to be home, baby! Feels good to be home!)\n",
