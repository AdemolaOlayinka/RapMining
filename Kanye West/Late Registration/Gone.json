Groupies sound too choosy\nTake 'em to the show and talk all through the movies\nSays she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays\nIf we up in Friday's, I still have it my way\n\n\nToo late, we, gone - we strivin home\nGone - we ride on chrome\nIt's too late\n\n\nY'all don't want no prob from me\nWhat you rappers could get is a job from me\nMaybe you could be my intern, and in turn\nI'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr\nAaron love the raw dog, when will he learn\nCaught somethin on the Usher tour he had to \"Let it Burn\"\nPlus he already got three chil'run\nArguin over babysitters like, \"Bitch - it's yo' turn!\"\nDamn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you\nEven your superficial raps is super official\nR-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on\nWith TV's in the ride, throw a movie on\nSaid he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long\nCause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone\n\n\nWe strivin home, gone\nI ride on chrome...\nWe strivin home, gone\nKilla, I ride on chrome\n\n\nKnock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?\nKilla Cam, hustler, grinder, gorilla true\nOh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer\nWell here's the deal ma we goin to the dealer booth\nNo concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof\nAct up, get out, I don't need you poof\nPoof, be gone, damn tough luck dag\nDag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass\nPull the truck up fast and I tell 'em\nHey, back in a touched up Jag, shit\nY'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum\nAn old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)\nThen I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)\nMy last girl want me back then I'm on\nFine stay, you got the grind hey\nCame back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)\nYes I know you wanna see my demise\nYeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise\nAin't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes\nAsk Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit\nAnd that ain't leavin alive, please believe me\nGave Weezy a piece of the pie, and\nYou can ask George or Regina\nThe whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now\n\n\nWe strivin home, I ride on chrome\nListen homeboy move on\nThat's your best bet, why's that?\nCause\n\n\nUhh, uhh, yo, yo\nI been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone\nAnd tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone\nAnd since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon\nGuess it's only right that I should help her from now on\nBut since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong\nNow they askin Cons, how long has this gone on\nAnd maybe all this money mighta gone to my head\nCause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds\nSo I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed\nAnd when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread\nAnd with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts\nAnd gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks\nBut lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib\nAnd rented \"Gone With the Wind,\" cause I'da gone about 10\nBut I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar\nAnd heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car\nAnd now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far\nAnd now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars\nAnd since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes\nI guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone\n\n\n\n\nUh-uh-uh\nUh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn\nUh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm\nAh-head of my time, sometimes years out\nSo the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out\nAnd that make me wanna get my advance out\nAnd move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house\nYeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind\nKanye step away from the lime-\n-light, like, when I was on the grind\nIn the \"One, Nine, Nine, Nine\"\nBefore, model chicks was bendin over or\nDealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man\nIf I could just get one beat on Hova\nWe could get up off this cheap-ass sofa\nWhat the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old\nSell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro\nMy dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural\nFired a week later the manager count the churros\nSometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow\nHow we out in Europe, spendin Euros\nThey claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE\nI know I got it, I don't know what y'all on\nI'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's\nWon't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free\nBut if they ever flip sides like Anakin\nYou'll sell everything includin the mannequin\nThey got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston\nHold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm\nShorty's at the door cause they need more\nInspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs\nThey said sorry Mr. West is gone!\n",
