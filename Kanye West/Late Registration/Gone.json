Groupies sound too choosy\nTake 'em to the show and talk all through the movies\nSays she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays\nIf we up in Friday's, I still have it my way\n\n\nToo late, we, gone - we strivin home\nGone - we ride on chrome\nIt's too late\n\n\nY'all don't want no prob from me\nWhat you rappers could get is a job from me\nMaybe you could be my intern, and in turn\nI'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr\nAaron love the raw dog, when will he learn\nCaught somethin on the Usher tour he had to \"Let it Burn\"\nPlus he already got three chil'run\nArguin over babysitters like, \"Bitch - it's yo' turn!\"\nDamn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you\nEven your superficial raps is super official\nR-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on\nWith TV's in the ride, throw a movie on\nSaid he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long\nCause the dookie's on any song that they threw me on, gone\n\n\nWe strivin home, gone\nI ride on chrome...\nWe strivin home, gone\nKilla, I ride on chrome\n\n\nKnock knock, who's there?
