' (uh)\nThis track the Indian dance to bring our reign back (whoo!)\n'Wassup with you a Jay man, are ya'll okay man? '\nYep!\nI got it from here 'ye damn!\nThe chain remains, the game is in tact\nThe name is mine, I'll take blame for that\nThe pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?\nPardon me I had to laugh at that\nHow could you falter when you're the rock of Gibraltar\nI had to get of the boat so I could walk on water\nThis ain't no tall order, this is nothin to me\nDifficult takes a day, impossible takes a week\nI do this in my sleep,\nI sold Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's\nI'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man\nLet me handle my buisness, damn!\nKanyeez you got me, Freeway and Foxy\nYG', Teairra Mari, Petey watch me\nBleek could be one hit away his whole career\nAs long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire\nAnd even if I die, he's in my will somewhere\nSo he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah\nHe don't even have to write rhymes\nThe Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes\nShirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly\nWhat I was sayin practically me whole career\nThe diamond is forever, I been minin' this forever\nNow the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better\nPeople lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'\nInstead we rose from the ashes like a phoenix\nIf you waitin' for the end of the dynasty sign\nIt'll seem like forever is a mighty long time\nI'm young bitches\nGoodnight!\n",
