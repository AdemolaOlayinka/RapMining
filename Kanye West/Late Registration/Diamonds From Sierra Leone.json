Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......\n\nClose your eyes and imagine, feel the magic\nVegas on acid,\nSeen through Yves St. Laurent glasses\nAnd I've realized that I've arrived, cuz\nIt take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does\nhe write his own rhymes, so sort of\nI think 'em\nThat mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up\nDamn, is he really that caught up?\nI ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?\nI remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder\nso its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche\n- its for yourself that's important\nIf a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men\nThen your fat friend her nickname is Minivan\nExcuse me,\nThat's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because\n\n\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.\nForever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......\n\nI was sick about awards\nCouldn't nobody cure me\nOnly playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry\nAlicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them\n30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them\nWhat more can you ask for?\nThe international assholes nah\nWho complains about what he is owed?\nAnd throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old\nYou gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul\nAnd wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,\nWhen he came, in the game, he made his own lane\nNow all I need is y'all to pronounce my name\nIts Kanye - But some of my plastic - they still say Kane\nGot family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown\nBack in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown\nLife movin' too fast I need to slow down\nGirl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down\n\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nMy father Ben said I need Jesus\nSo he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThe preacher said we need leaders\nRight then my body got still like a paraplegic\n\nYou know who you can call you gotta best believe it\nThe Roc stand tall and you would never believe it\nTake your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic\nYea the beat cold but the flow is anemic\nAfter debris settles and the dust get swept off\nBig K pick up where young Hov left off\nRight when magazines wrote Kanye West off\nI dropped my new shit sound like the best of\nA&R's lookin' like \"pssh we messed up\"\nGrammy night, damn right, we got dressed up\nBottle after bottle till we got messed up\nIn the studio, where really though, yea he next up\nPeople askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back\nThat'll be the same day I give the game back\nYou know the next question dog \"Yo, where Dame at?\"\nThis track the Indian dance to bring our reign back\n\"What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?\"\nThey pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen\nR-r-r-right here stands a-man\nWith the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...\n\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nThrow your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\nThe Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.\nForever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......\n\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever)\nDiamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)\n",
