Not even prerequits?\nYou mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?\nNow I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin\nWith all the rest of the muh'fuckers underachievin\nMan, this is a insult\nI went to junior high with all of them and they been slow\nIf I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo\nJust notice at the end if I'm too late for the intro\nWill I make it from the student loans to a Benz-o?\nLike old folks pissin, I guess it all (Depends), oh, oh\n... Stop you're cryin baby\n\n\n\n\nYou know when you be late you miss all the lights\nThat's right (that's right) that's right (that's right)\nAnd when you get back she gon' start up a fight\nThat night (that night) that night\nBaby it's too late for that, lately I've been takin it slow\nTry and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close\nWith the freshest hoes, the professors know\nWe about to get real unprofessional\nLike them eskimos, what would you do for a Klondike?\nOr two dykes that look Christina Milian like\nHmmm, I'll be on time for that\nI ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that\nYo, I'll be there in five minutes, five hours later\nI'll be there in five minutes, go 'head ride with it\nI'm so live with it, look how I did it\nBeen bullshittin but I finally arrived with it\nI know it's late and I took all year but\nYou can stop complainin cause I'm finally here, yeah\n\n\"I'll be late for that\" -\n",
