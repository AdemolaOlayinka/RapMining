Eating every day.\nPretending he's with us, he's not one of us.\nI did not want to believe this, but I walked into the brother Kanye's closet and I found new shoes.\nI found new shoes!\nKanye, would you like to step forward and explain these new shoes?!\n\nI was-you crazy, I wasn't, I didn't, um, I was just um, I was-\n\nNo, you speak up, brother!\n\nI was gon' stick-I'm tryin to stick to my roots and-\n\nWhat?\n\nI wanna stick to my roots, and-\n\nWhat?! You march your new shoes out of here, Kanye.\nDon't you ever come back in 'em. Don't you ever come back smellin' all good, taking showers and shit like\nThat, all right? We don't appreciate that down here at Broke Phi Broke.\n\nWhat's next?\n",
