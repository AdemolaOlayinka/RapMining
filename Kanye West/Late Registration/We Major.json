Both flows would be nice\nRap about big paper or the black man's plight\nAt the studio consol asked my man to the right\nWhat this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?\nHe said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic\nPicked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel\nBeen like 12 years since a nigga first signed\nNow I'm a free agent\nAnd I'm thinking it's time\nTo build my very own Motown\nCuz rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s\nAnd it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life\nAnd I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic\nSo y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt\nI'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed\nI survived the livest niggas around\nLasting longer than more than half of you clowns\nLook, I used to cook before I had the game took\nEither way my change came like Sam Cooke.\n\nFeeling better than I ever felt before today\nLike better late than never is orientation\nStill we can make it better throwing all your cares away\n",
