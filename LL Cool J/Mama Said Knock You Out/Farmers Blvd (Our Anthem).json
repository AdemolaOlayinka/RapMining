I'm makin moves, not fakin moves\nSo don't you never come around here, talkin that talk\nOr walkin that walk, you'll get played like a sport\nFootball, soccer, whatever you savour\nYou're a tramp and a pussycat, ready for labor\nHa! L'll have you breakin locks\nI'll have you cookin fried rice in a big steel box\nThe type of skills that I got reigned for years\nNo worry or cares, your crew'll shed tears\n'Hip-hip-hooray, he's back!' Yo, save the cheers\nSuckers, I'm drinkin forties of beers\nOn the Boulevard\n\nFunky, funky, funky rhymes bein said here\nHey yo, hey yo\nHey yo Uncle L, let's go...\nYeah man, I wanna check out my man Big Money Grip\nYo, what's up, man\nKick a little somethin\n\n\nKick out the can and slam\nSummertime, C.I.A. step into the jam\nReach for the mic, and the punks start to fold up\nAnd the brothers start fleein like it's a hold-up\nSome step aside, but a few play me close\nNever worry, cause the brother who cross me's gettin burried\nAnd the fool who wants to deal with another dose\nI see to it in a hour that the mutha is comatose\nFarmers Boulevard, the place\nHandin me a mic is like givin a chainsaw to Leatherface\nSmokin MC's in an instant\nAt my side bustin caps is T-Boogie, my assistant\nThrow that speaker in the trash\nWhy's that? Cause Gangster Boogie gave the woofer a gash\nBig Money Grip makin you get up\nFarmers Crew's in effect, we never heard of a head-up\n\nYo, yo, yo\nIt's kinda funky out here on the boulevard, yo\nYeah, we livin chinese people in a turkish bath, baby\nHi C over there, man\nYo, what's up Hi C...\n\n\nHi C on the scene, at last to bust a funky rhyme\nMore than a line on time, because I'm gettin mine\nNever underestimate the skill of a great one\nThe Boulevard Lord, shorts, never take none\nAnother funky rapper from around the way\nLeavin bodies at a party, cause somebody gotta pay\nBoy, you been told, put your lips on hold\nAll you remember is a barrel and a mouth full of gold\nSpreadin terror on the street like they was in the past\nAny punks on the block, yo, never could last\nAnd I never feel sorry for a sucker I gained on\nAny slick talker, yo, he's bound to get rained on\nAt any Farmers party at my side is a Mag\n(One time a sucker got ill and went out in a bodybag)\nFear will erupt through the heart of another\nThe Farmers Crew will never fall, that's word to the mother\n\nYo, yo\nIt's kinda funky out here\nYo, yo, yo, Hi C\nYo man, y'all kinda funky out here, yo\nI was -\nYo, what's up?\n...9 years ago, man\nYouknowmsayin?\nFarmers Boulevard, baby\nYo, I was kinda -\nI was kinda stagnant to sleep on it\nBut yo, L\nWon't you - won't you sum it all up for the people, aight?\nAight, let me sum this up\n\n\nNow you heard the brothers speakin bout the street that we're from\nRhymes hittin, beats kickin, you can't get none\nF-a-r-m-e-r-s passin the test\nMarley Marl in the background doin the rest\nDo-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, do-ti-la-so-fa-mi-re-do, kato\nGet up out my face before I play you like Play-Doh\nI did a jam against all odds\nAnd it was dedicated to Farmers Boulevard\n\n(Farmers Boulevard)\n\nKeep on\n\n(Farmers Boulevard)\n\nTo the beat, y'all\nA funky beat, y'all\nYes, yes, y'all\nYou don't stop\n",
