    "lyrics": "(And you say New York City...)\n\n\n(They're jinglin', baby) Go 'head, baby.\n\nUncle. L. Future of the funk. Records I recorded minus all the junk.\nPeople spread gossip and believe what they must,\nbut I slam dunk punks and make 'me bite the dust.\nA minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed,\nand put 'em in a bucket like he's chicken feed.\nCheck out the...pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice (nice-nice);\nand I'm-a dust you off and dust you off twice.\nI heard it's all observant, hysterical fan-\n-natics of the Asiatic miracle man.\nProminent, dominant, McCoy and I'm real.\nAnother brother's fan? Forget how you feel.\nHe's so-so, I got the instinct.\nThey call me Deputy Dog to put your booty in the clink.\nYou're dancin' to a Marley Marl remix single, love:\nLet me see your earrings jingle, love...\n\n\n\nI chopped you, chewed you, baked you, and schooled you.\nThat slop you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you\nno good niggaboo tryin' to base, how we livin', homes? Get out my face!\nI'm complete, in effect, and I can't maul.\nRise, suprise, and I advise you all.\nTo stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt.\nMy skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out, huh.\nI'm top-notch, you're playin' hop-scotch.\nNow I'm-a do ya while the party people watch.\nYou're real funny, you really try to go for yours.\nBut I know why: you ain't had no dough before.\nSo you tried and lied to drain my fame.\nThis ain't a game, yo, you know my name.\nInnovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now,\ndance to my remix single...\n\n\n\nWhen you first walked in, I ain't know what to think,\ncuz you grabbed the microphone like your booty don't stink.\nAnd tried to run down that, I can't get over that\ngarbage you were sayin': you call that a battle rap?\nHow you gonna go against an army with a handgun?\nI'm L.L., and you don't understand, son.\nI'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin'.\nNow you look booty like that bum Miss Givins.\nWhoever geesed you up...nah, how should I say it?\nWhoever set you up, they knew just how to play it.\nCuz man, YO, I feel for ya brother, I'm a baaaaaad...\n(Word to the mother!)\nTakin' out sucker while the ladies pucker,\nand rollin' over punks like a redneck trucker.\nInnovating, devastating, and dope on a single, now...\nlemme see your earrings jingle...\n\n...break down!\n\n\n\nCan't believe you tried to get the same mic as me,\nyour grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B.\nYou can dream of makin' progress and gettin' this nice,\nbut when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice.\nServe to curbs, I never swerve a superb.\nEvery word you heard played tricks on your nerves.\nPlayed your hand, lost track of your plan,\nwhen I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man.\nPlay you like a poker chip, that's what you get.\nI bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met\nthe Titan of Fightin', excitin' when writin',\nyou're trite from the toy, boy, I gotta enlight, so start bitin'.\nYou know you can't create and get mean like this;\nwhen I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!\nWhen it's all over, said and done, my friend,\nthey'll say, \"L.L. Cool J just scored again.\"\nSo take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop.\nHere's your token back, you're gettin' off at the next stop.\nI'm-a deliver and give a speech with vigor.\nPass the wine cooler you big black....\n\n\n(And you say New York City)\n",
