No one knows\nLike I said before, bring on the mo's and ho's\nI know my abc's and my p's and q's\nJust chill and listen to the rhyme cruise\nAll aboard, the cod is a reward\nSome were ignored when they toured for they bored\nThe crowd was aloud, lyrics weren't endowed\nTook a crack of the 40 and went to show em how\nYou like me now, but you didn't before\nCause you forgot I was raw\n\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Yo, eat em up, L)\n\nAh\n\nFuture of the funk, ah\n\n(Go 'head, baby)\n(Do it)\n\nGo 'head, baby\n(Do it)\nYeah\n(Do it)\n\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Yo, eat em up, L)\n\n\nIt's so visual the way I'm throwin down\nVisualize MC's goin down\nIn a barrage of bullets combinated with rhymes\nThe moral of the story is: I'ma get mines\nI saw the cord-less, boy, I'm gonna house that\nYour rhymes are cheesy, you found em in a mouse trap\nDon't try to front while the freestyle's droppin\nHe wants to battle, he must be needle-poppin\nYou better notify your next akin\nCause when I begin it's like a needle to the skin\nIf you wasn't prepared\nThen you ought to be scared\nBut even if you was\nYou're aware what the rhyme does\nI remember when you was an amateur\nWritin your rhymes, starin at my signature\nBought the album, analyzed the style\nTisk-tisk (Hatchew!) God bless you, child\nI'm unique when I speak to a beat\nAnother rapper'll fall when the mission's complete\nI daze and amaze, my display's a faze\nEvery phrase is a maze as Uncle L slays\nThe competition that's lost in a freestyle\nCause on the mic I'm the golden child\nWith the magical wand that they're callin a mike\nAnd when MC's approach it turns into a spike\n\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nChill\n(Eat em up, L)\nWhy don't you just chill\n(Eat em up, L)\n\nYeah\n\nYeah\nI wanna say what's up to my man Kool Herc\nAnd my man Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation\nKnow what what I'm sayin\nMy man Marley Marl and DJ Clash\nMy man B-Blast\nRush Town\nDef Jam\nWe in the house\nOf course I gotta say what's up to my homeboys EPMD\nYeah\nI get busy\nPeace\n",
