    "lyrics": "I seen this girl, walkin down the block\nI said, \"WAIT!\"\n\"Yo baby, you wanna come to my crib?\"\n\"Have some donuts and milk?\"\n\"Listen to a pop tune maybe?\"\n\nPlease be his ex and be my bride\nDon't blame it on yourself, sweet thing, you tried\nLove you claimed to share just wasn't there\nYou're too good for that, and it wasn't fair\nLove's taken its toll, your heart he stole\nYou was fooled by the face of a phoney role\nBut I'll take up the slack, support you, baby\nNow the knight in shiny armor can only be me\nI cry out your name as you hold his hand\nIf you're not mine soon, girl, my soul is damned\nI'm lookin out the window at the stormy rain\nAnd the rush of the water makes my eyes drain\nAll alone in the room, and it's makin me sad\nFantasize of the love we could have had\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n\nI pour wine for two, even though it's just me\nI tried to reach you, but blind men don't see\nYour man is the devil, but he gave you a ring\nSo you believe you saw an innocent angel sing\nYou're the type that ignores the destiny of two\nIt's not Romeo and Juliet, it's me and you\nYou're bein handicapped by a Don Juan rap\nYou can hope I disappear, girl, but I'll be back\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\nYes girl, I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n\nThe time has come, the decision's yours\nThis super love story ain't workin no more\nCan't you understand that my love spans\nHigher and further than any man's\nYou're lookin a gift horse right in the mouth\nThis time hear me out, I don't care if you pout\nYou're my only desire, I fight to the death\nAnd I'ma scream your name when I breathe my last breath\nAin't gettin on my knees, but I'm oh so close\nTo our love I toast, all he does is boast\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n\nA knock on the door and a tap on the glass\nTells me you see it my way at last\nYou used to reject me, now you wanna kiss me\nHe called you up and said, \"Yo baby, why you diss me?\"\nMeanwhile made romance on the sea shore\nYou want more of what you used to ignore\nDuring this love affair, girl, it gets steamy\nThree nights in a row, and you still wanna see me\nMake love at night, coffee in the morn'\nI be the only blanket that's keepin you warm\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n\nI hoot in the morning to the crack of sunlight\nBut my agony continues till it reaches night\nSweet image of your face appears on the wall\nAnd the scene is so eerie I run through the hall\nI look at the sky, then I search for the moon\nRealize it's 3 o'clock in the afternoon\nSo I dress to impress, exit the house\nGo up to the school and watch the kids come out\nIn the middle of the court yard there you stand\nWith the man who's deceiving ya, holding your hand\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n\nYou're the goddess of light, the queen of seduction\nYou won't get used if you follow my instructions\nYour scram my hand, feel the sweat on my palm\nMake love to a man and not a cheap Don Juan\nAnd that'll be eroticism, highs die down\nYou will find your best friend finally is found\nI caress ya at night like a virgin in white\nCause the new world I found is oh so tight\nAnd tender and young, soft and wet\nIt's hotter than any fantasy could get\nCause I never met anyone like you before\nAnd I can give you more\n",
