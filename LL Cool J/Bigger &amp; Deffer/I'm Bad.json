Cool J)\n(He's bad...)\nAaaahhhhhhhhhh...\n\nNo rapper can rap quite like I can\nI'll take a musclebound man and put his face in the sand\nNot the last Mafioso I'm a MC cop\nMake you say, \"Go L.L. and do the wop\"\n\nIf you think you can outrhyme me, yeah boy I bet\nCause I ain't met a motherfucker who can do that yet\nTrendsetter I'm better my rhymes are good\nI got a gold name plate that says I wish you would\n\nAnd when rap begin then I gotta join in and\nBefore my rhyme is over you know I'm a win\nCool J has arrived so you better make way\nAsk anybody in the crowd they say the kid don't play!\n\nSparring competition that's my hobby and job\nI don't wear a disguise because I don't own the mob\nGot a pinpoint rap that makes you feel trapped\nSo many girls on my jock I think my phone here is tapped\n\nI'm bad\n(Cool J)\n(Cool J)\n(Cool J)\n(C C C C Cool J J)\n(Cool J)\n(C C C C C C C Cool J J J J J)\n\nI'm like Tyson icin' I'm a soldier at war\nI'm makin' sure you don't try to battle me no more\nGot concrete rhymes been rappin' for ten years and\nEven when I'm braggin' I'm bein' sincere\n\nMC's can't win I make 'em rust like tin\nThey call me Jaws my hat is like a shark's fin\nBecause I'm bad as can be got my voice on wax\nSome brothers think he's making records now he must have relaxed\n\nI couldn't shouldn't and it'll stay that way\nThe best rapper you've heard is L.L. Cool J\nKamikaze take a look at what I've done\nUsed to rock in my basement now I'm number one\n\nAnd can happen on time never standin' on line\nYou wanna try me first you better learn how to rhyme\nI'm the pinnacle that means I reign supreme\nAnd I'm notorious I'll crush you like a jelly bean\n\nI'm bad\n\nI eliminate punks cut 'em up in chunks\nYou were souped you heard me and your ego shrunk\nI'm devastating I'm so good it's a shame\nCause I eat rappers like a cannibal they call me insane\n\nI'm as strong as a bull of course you know I am pull\nI enjoy what I'm doing plus I'm paid in full\nNot Buckaroo Bonsai but busted out as I\nSay the kind of rhymes that make MC's wish that I die\n\nNever retire or put my mike on the shelf\nThe baddest rapper in the history of rap itself\nNot bitter or mad just provin' I'm bad\nYou want a hit give me a hour plus a pen and a pad\n\nMC's they retreat cause they know I can beat 'em\nAnd eat 'em in a battle and the ref won't cheat 'em\nI'm the best takin' out all rookies\nSo forget Oreos eat Cool J cookies\n\nI'm bad\n(Cool J)\n(Cool J)\n(Cool J)\n(Cool J J J)\n(Cool J J J)\n(C Cool J)\n\nNever ever no never\nNever wearin' no Levis battle me why try\nI'll treat you like a stepchild so tell mommy bye bye\nSparrin' MC's and I'm a never get whipped\nWhen I retire I'll get worship like a old battleship\n\nL.L. I'm bad other rappers know\nWhen I enter the center they say, \"Yo, yo there he go!\"\nMy paycheck's large Mr. Bogart in charge\nNot a puncher or hunter from a rap cool large\n\nThe original Todd teachin' how to be hard\nTake the skin off a snake and split a pea from a pod\nYou're a novice I'm noble and I decipher my tongue\nNot Atilla the Hun but no I'm Threwler his son\n\nMy vulture's exact like rack and pinion in a Jag\nYou try to brag you get your rhymes from a grab-bag\nNo good scavenger catfish vulture\nMy tongue's a chisel in this competition sculpture\n\nI'm bad\n(Think I'm gonna need backup)\n(Think I'm gonna need backup)\n(Give me that Walkie Talkie.)\n(Yo this is L.L. Cool J)\n(And you'll never catch me so don't even try it)\n(I'm too bad for ya, understand...)\nAaaaaahhhh... I'm bad!\n",
