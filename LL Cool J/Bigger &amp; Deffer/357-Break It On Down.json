(1, 2, 3) catch twenty-two I'm H-A-R-D\nI'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town\nI gotta .357 and I break it on down\n\n\nRock the beat now that can be arranged\nYo baby you look fine spread em\nYo homeboy get up against the wall put this in your pocket\nWho is this?\nMove it, move it, move it\n\n\nI'm a nappy, sappy crappy imitator of who\nIf I ever imitated it wouldn't be you, ooooh\nYou don't know so many have died when the LL growl was amplified\nGet back better yet step back get dat\nLike shaft in the Mack cause I'm mad and I'm black\nI'm a perfect plan a good boyfriend\nI'm the reason rap rules and the country out Cool J-A-M-E-S\nFresh as a cliche but so is my forte\nThis goes out whether the blues is old news\nP's and Q's keep me in your shoes\nand you're dissin me because I'm young and I'm strong\nAnd cause I'm capable of makin a platinum LP\nWrong you was, you assumed I was all in\nBut boy is for ballin they'll never say I'm fallin\nCallin all cars for the brother in black\nL-E-L the Mack back bone of this track\nI'm force full of force to put you on your back\nMakin hit after hit while you sent for a contract\nHotter than hot now watch how hot I can get\nLeavin rappers fee's dried and skimmer's dimmer's wet\nI'm as hard as hard rock in the hard rock town\nI gotta .357 and I break it on down\n\n\nNow the LL posse is now handin out speed knots\nto all those who don't want to get busy\nThat's right baby get your body on the floor\nMove it, move it\n.357 at point blank range ain't nothin strange\nyou're havin a heart attack is at your back\nNow listen to me bring it, bring it on, on down, down, down, down, down, down\n",
