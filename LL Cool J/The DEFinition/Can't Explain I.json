I can't explain it\n\n\nCan't explain it\nMy love when we're together\nYou're the greatest, nobody does it better\nWhen you hold me\nI wish that I could be your, one and only\nNobody does it better\n\n\nI understand you want canaries on your hand\nMasterpiece Roley, gold tri-color band\nCute wedding pictures sittin on the nightstand\nYou don't wanna make it happen unless it's the right man\nI know you won't touch me unless you trust me\nYou kiss me and hug me but still won't crush me\nI'm kissin on your neck real tender\nGentle as can be, but you still won't surrender\nLet me kiss your eyes\nLet the smell of the incense enhance the vibe\nI pull back to stare at your eyes\nSittin there quiet like I'm hypnotized\nWe kiss a little more, laugh and smile\nMight even share a lollipop, you know my style\nKick your Charles Davids off, relax for a while\nLet's pretend that we're walkin down the aisle\nI can't explain it\n\n\n\n\nStraight up, you beautiful B\nI don't think you understand what you doin to me\nOn the couch witcha legs crossed, watchin TV\nShoe hangin off the tip of your foot, you killin me\nUhh.. then we kiss for real\nI'm fully prepared, I'm already steel\nYou go to the bathroom for a second\nI understand baby, I know what you checkin (a-heh-heh)\nThat's when you come back and walk to me slow\nThat's when you change up and let it all flow\nI'm kissin on your belly ring nice and slow\nI love to take my time, love to give you a show\nGet the warm chocolate syrup to travel below\nUse my ears like handlebars, take control\nAin't no sense in stayin calm and playin the role\nBaby relax, let me touch your soul\nI can't explain it\n\n\n\n\nMy turn to get rocked, lifted out my socks\nwith sound effects and whatnot (mmm)\nA little perfume above the right spot, just a touch\nNever too much, I lick it like a Dutch\nTwo of my favorite numbers, you know what I mean\nAdd 'em up and they equal fifteen\nYou the 6... I needed you like a fix\nI can see it my mind, I knew we was gon' click\nI pick up the pace\nYou feel the stubble from my beard on your face\nI look at your lips and take a taste\nSwitch it up I got my hands on your waist\nWe whylin out, we all over the place\nI'm holdin on with a strong embrace\nYou holdin on and tryin to keep the faith\nTogether we blast to outer space, I can't explain it\n",
