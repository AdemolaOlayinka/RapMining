You\nI love you, that's why you got nurses and maids\nEver since I got paid, you ain't never been afraid\nThat's granddaddy wife, she taught me how to think\nHow to navigate through life, you made the sacrifice\nYou kept on livin, cause when my granddaddy died\nIt took all your might, but you ain't quit on life\nWe took trips down South, biscuits and chicken\nMe you granddad and Alison, trippin\nRemember, you used to pick me up from junior high\nAnd classmates laughed when the Buick rolled by\nRemember, I pulled my privates out in class\nAnd from Farmers to Dunkirk you straight whooped my (woo!!)\nThe best cookin a man could ever taste\nIt's written in my heart, it can never be erased\nThank you so much, you taught me well\nHow to not get souped up, because I'm LL\nHow to walk the street, and hold my head real high\nHow to live with Christ and not be afraid to die\nWe sipped daquiris, but you never told moms\nWe even shared beers, Big Mama my dear\nA toast to a woman that raised a man\nIn popular demand all across the land\nYou're my lawyer, my teacher, my doctor, my friend\nMy mother, my father, you with me 'til the end\nI love you, I mean that from the bottom of my heart\nThat's the reason why my record's #1 on the charts\nI'ma tell it like it is, I love you forever\nDead or alive, we'll always be together\nBig Mama I love you\n\n\n\n\nI dedicate this to the Big Mama's everywhere\nThe ones who raised us - when nobody else was there\nThe ones who held us and told us it'll be alright\nWhen gunshots was goin off every night\nTaught us how to lock the door and check the peephole\nAnd how to swallow Vicks when we had a chest cold\nHow to stay proud, and represent hard\nEat plenty baby, but first say grace for God\nBig Mama, I'ma miss you\nWhen one of us leave this earth\nBut baby for what it's worth, I love you since the date of my birth\nAnd if it wasn't for my children, I would wanna go first\nYou're the reason I'm the man I am today\nThe inspiration, for me to be LL Cool J\nWhen you told me \"Knock 'Em Out,\" I brought you home a Grammy\nI learned to be tough from Big Mama and Aunt Cammy\nA black man that was raised by black women\nOn tour, sippin your special honey and lemon\nYou told me, gargle with vinegar water and salt\nThe concert was hot, thanks to your support\nGirl - you're the one I love\nWhether right here with me or smilin from up above\nTrouble or no trouble, you always had my back\nSo I had to let you know your son appreciates that, Big Mama\n",
