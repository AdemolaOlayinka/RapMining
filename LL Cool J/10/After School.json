Nothin can save ya\nOnce again I got 'em catchin the vapors\n\n\nMr. Smith bout to get this paper\nPaparazzi, pleaase give me a minute\nYou're pushin me to the limit, I know that I represent it\nBe easy!\n\n\nTammy, down in Miami\nFa'scheezy baby uhh, I see you at the Grammy's\n\n\n\n\nEverybody go - I wanna rock right now\nLL and Diddy, we came to get down\nYes we're internationally known\nfor making movies and the microphone\nCause we get crazy, I mean outrageous\nYou rollin with us? You rollin with flavor\n\nAsk Penny, I call her Good'n'Plenty (why?)\nCause after the show, there's nuttin open but Denny's (oh yeah)\nMaybe the waffle house, down South there's many\nShe fix me a T-bone and take it to the Bentley\n\n\nLittle Shaniqua, from Massapequa\nWent and bought a beeper so I could reach her - anyway\n\n\nWhen you talk about Diddy and L\nYou talk about careers that's hard to kill\nThe whole entire globe recognize the grill\nWalkin down the red carpet we're chilly chill!\n\n\n\n\nEverybody go - I wanna rock right now\nLL and Diddy, we came to get down\nYes we're internationally known\nfor making movies and the microphone\nCause we get crazy, I mean outrageous\nYou rollin with us? You rollin with flavor\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody go..\nFriends to the end baby, y'knahmsayin?\nGot history baby\nNot even, no question about it\nWe won't stop\nYeah never, word up, we keepin this money\n10\nOh yeah\n10\nRockin with my man, rockin with that Bad Boy cat\nUncle L\nRock the Bells\nA.K.A., Black Elvis\nP. Diddy\nDiddy\nHottest man in the city\nY'all see it\nWord up, please believe it\nSmile at it, love it, embrace it\nAhh, grin baby, grin\nGet used to it\nThat gettin money smile\n",
