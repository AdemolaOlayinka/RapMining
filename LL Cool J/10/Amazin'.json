Uh-huh\nHehehe, I appreciate it\n\n\nIt's so amazing, your love, to me\nIt's so amazing, amazing, to me\nIt's so amazing, your love, to me\nIt's so amazing, amazing, to me\n\nIt's alright..\nSometimes you work late at night (I know baby)\n(I miss you too)\nJust as long, as you don't defy my love\nThen it's on (I promise you baby)\n(I'll always love you)\n\n\nUh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order\nWould chip in to vent, but the city's on water\nSearchlights and fireworks bling the sky\nA vowel on the end of everything we buy\nYellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie\nI'm lovin this lifestyle, baby I can't lie\nIt feels so good it make a grown man cry\nCause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died\nI guess I had determination\nAnd baby girl kept me in the congregation\nNow it's private jets and deep conversation\nHundred G's a month to show appreciation\nAll eyes on us, the cameras flash\nIn God We Trust, I don't love this cash\nBut you was definitely - by my side when my world collapsed\nNow I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is like this for life baby\nThis gon' always be like this\nGod is my witness\nHold you tight for the rest of my life\nYknahmsayin?\nThere's nothing I won't do for you baby\nI'm your man, I'm your man\nOur love is amazing, yeah\n\nIt's so, amazing, to me\n",
