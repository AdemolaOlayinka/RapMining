So here we are\nFace to face, mic to mic, man to man\nWhile your battle ship is sinkin' in quicksand\nStrappin' to the bottom like a two-ton anchor\nAnd break, pull the rope, point blank, I'm a sniper\nRapper like a pack, step on 'em like a mack\nMy DJ Cut-Creator scratch a record like a cat\nE at my side with pride who got a bigger rep\nShh... smoke the mic like a cigarette\nEvery puff is rough I pull, kill a bull\nOne toke, your crews' a joke\nI run through rappers like runnin' through rubber holes is\nNigga, I'm comin' up roses\nStep back - I got the title - bear-witness to a dope recital\nI've killed many men my friend and I'ma do it again and again and again\nCause it gets no rougher\n\n\nYouknowI'msayin'? I'm rulin' this game\nIt don't get no rougher, peace, LL Cool J\n",
