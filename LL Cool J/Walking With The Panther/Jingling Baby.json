Forget how you feel\ncause he's so-so, I got the instinct\nThey call me Deputy Dog, now put your {ass} in the clink\nInnovating, devestating, and dope on the single now\nlet me see your earrings jingle\n\n\n\n\nI chopped you, chewed you, baked you and {fucked} you\nThat {shit} you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you\nno good {niggaboo} tryin to base\nHow we livin Holmes? Get out my face!\nI'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall\nI rise, suprise, and I advise you all\nto stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt\nMy skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out\nI'm top-notch, you're still playin hop-scotch\nNow I'ma do ya while the party people watch\nYou're real funny, you really try to go for yours\nBut I know why: you ain't had no dough before\nSo you tried and lied to drain my fame\nThis ain't a game, yo, you know my name\nForget all the MC's who like to mingle\nYo baby, let me see your earrings jingle\n\n\n\n\nWhen you first walked in, I ain't know what to think\nYou grabbed the microphone like your {shit} don't stink\nAnd tried to run down that; I can't get over that\n{bullshit} you were sayin - you call that a battle rap?\nHow you gonna go against an army with a handgun?\nI'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son\nI'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin\nNow you look stupid like that {bitch} Ms. Givens\nWhoever geesed you up; nah, how should I say it?\nWhoever set you up, they knew just how to play it\nCause man, YO, I feel for you brother\nI'm a baaaaaad... (Word to my mother!)\nTakin out suckers while the ladies pucker\nand rollin over {niggaz} like a redneck trucker\nInnovatin, devastatin, and dope on a single, now\nLemme see your earrings jingle\n\n\n\n\nYeah baby, you know what I mean?\nYou like be jinglin crazy, word\n(yeah yeah yeah)\nAll over this funky beat\nYou be like jinglin, and your earrings be jinglin\nand shakin all over the place and all (mm-hmm)\nIt's like real, it's real wild to me honey yaknahwhatImean?\nThe way you be jinglin, worrrrrrd\n\n\n\n\nCan't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me\nYour grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B\nYou can dream of makin progress and gettin this nice\nbut when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice\nI serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb\nEvery word you heard played tricks on your nerves\nYou played your hand, lost track of your plan\nWhen I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man\nI'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get\nI bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met\nthe titan of fightin, excitin when writin, you triflin toy-boy\nI gotta enlighten, so start bitin\nYou know you can't create and get mean like this\nwhen I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!\nWhen it's all over, said and done, my friend\nthey say, \"That {bad motherfucker} just scored again\"\nSo take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop\nHere's your token back, you're gettin off at the next stop\nI'ma deliver and give a speech with vigor\nI drink some Olde E and start waxin {niggaz}\n",
