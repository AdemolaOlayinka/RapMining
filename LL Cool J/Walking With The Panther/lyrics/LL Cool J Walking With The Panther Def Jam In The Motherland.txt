LL Cool J
Walking With The Panther
1989)
Yeah, yeah, checkin' 'em out
Special shout-out, keepin' on
Check it out y'all, my man in the house...


Corkunrun absolute killer of all
Take her blood, bouncin' heads like balls
Murderer, somethin' mutilater of Amiga
I get ill, so blood spills, everytime I speak
Drivin' Bombs that inveterate your ego
Suckers all weird, no let the best go migo
They talk and talk, I invade and take over
Forget Mako, you gonna need a make-over
I'm ferocious, animalistic, an animal
On the mic - I'm a cannibal
I eat livers, hearts, legs and arms
They crown me the King of doin' nothin' but harm
I'm two with the Universe and I'ma make you
diverse, make I kill quick, so you'll win from crew to hers
I'ma Titan, keepin' you frightened
I went to the Motherland, so now I'm enlightened
There's a...


Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland


For bow-take to far cynical of Egypt
Cool J I'm slay and I'm fully equipped
to decapatate, amputate and take titles
The legend of leather, I'ma real live idol
Damn I take souls, condemn we men
and make microphones men again and again
Cause, I'm blood thirsty watch and try to curse me
You'll lose the battle even if you out re-hearsed me
I'ma rip holes watch heads roll, like a mole
when I'm strollin' with my neck on a goal
My battles' like a blackout, you can't back out
Only difference, no time to feel a track out
It's a...


Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland


So come forward, admit you're guilty
Admit that your thoughts of New Jack killed me
Admit you were sleepin' on the skills of L
Now know that I handle mine, very well
I burn buildings, eat emcee's
Smack DJ's and tell the seated girls please
They try to jam hard, but I'ma fan God
And they could never get a piece of the man Todd
King Posse ruler and high roller
You losin' it son, your games' gettin' colder
It's a...


Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland


I'm a Monar, the Warlord of life
the eliminator, and I'ma score tonight
Somethin' like Murley, but it goes much deeper
Now just another rapper with a chain and a beeper
One sample is ample, four emcees'll get trampled
Bein' absent from God, I'ma give you sample
My vocabulary's legendary, my rumpy your temporary
So what your name in the bituary
Step back the conquerer spreads his wings
Kindergarten rappers, I'm back to change things
I rock the clearest, one hell of a learer
Since I can't miss and I'm kinda like a chemist
When I put a potion together it's splendid and fatal
You can never make a move on me cause you're still premado
Grip the mic tight sometimes I get calasis
And when I'm through you face baralysis
I'm gettin' thinner, watch me eat dinner
I'm down to skinner beginner to be a winner
It's a...


Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland


Who gets the roughest, you know the answer
You're a dandelion, I'm a panther
When I pick up the mic, as my fist see mo'
King of Rackadochio, I'm magnifigo
When I rock, hearts roll on and walk bad
Cause I know it's makes the face-sucker-ducks mad
I came back to smack wifes and pull cards
Introducin' the original Todd
Just like a bloodhound but I got this spellbound
Your rhymes are snowbound and I can throwdown
I'm like a thundercloud, I drop heavy
Hold steady, get ready, your petti confetti
Techniques and styles - they ain't ready
Ah, ah, yeah - full of horsepower and I'ma devour
Stay clean when I scream you're soft las cauliflower
I set the track and record you like a brown mouse
Then flick and do a Bruce Lee 'roundhouse
No threat exist, no man can stand
say mic check and expect to take the man


Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland
It's a Def Jam in the Motherland, Def Jam in the Motherland
Def Jam in the Motherland, in the Motherland, uh
