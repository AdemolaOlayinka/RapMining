Uh\nYeah\nYo, let me tell you bout a girl named Peg\nA D.C. haircut and stewardess legs\nDressed to kill, her physique is ill\nHer face belongs on a dollar bill\nHer boyfriend's down with the M-O-B\nDrivin around in a 300e\nTrunk jewelry and all that\nTalkin bout, \"My man can't fall black!\"\nSippin on cham', diamonds on her hand\nTakin cash, carryin drugs for her man\nDrivin around in a kitted up Jetta\nUnder the seat a automatic beretta\nYou know, the whole blase blah of rap\nTellin brothers they need to get off the brastrap\nThat's the type of girl she is\nWord to Miz, she got the\nfull length blue fox, knock you out the box\nBig rocks, this girl is hype Hobbes\nThe type of girl that cold did son wrong\nShe got the face that you wanna spend money on\nHer man be smackin her up\nYeah, backin her up\nto the wall, get undressed, where you goin?\nYou ain't playin me out with that hoein\nLook in the mirror, check the jewels\nSilly rabbit, you know the rules\nBut he had to leave on another deal\nSo she's out there with sex appeal\nIt's the weekend, time for freakin, she's sneakin\noutside, tellin her homegirls, we can\ndo the do, with who-ever we want to\ncause we're the fly girl crew\nNot knowin her man messed up the money\nRidin around, thinkin everything's funny\nWent in a disco, came outside\nSomebody pushed her in a beat up ride\nShe had to pay for her man's mistakes\nThey shot her in the head\nThat's the breaks\n",
