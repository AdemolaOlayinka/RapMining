JUMP!\nAnd jingle your rump. RUMP!\nHere to pump punks\nwith real hot lead chunks.\nFull-grown\nI ain't no baby with these rhymes kid.\nPut the mic down\nmy peoples know where ya live.\nI chop you little brittle riddle\nright up the middle\nand have the police playin the fiddle\nin the hospital.\nSomebody said, \"He couldn't rip with the roughness.\"\nRhymes kick your teeth\nbut end up frontless.\nSoul survivor of a thousand beats\nsendin funeral wreathes\nto all ya use-to-be chiefs.\nIs a raw\nto a bearlin in the woods (?).\nBrothers tapes ain't jack\ntheir best tracks is wack.\nI heard you think you got a chance to win\nbut my glock is stopped off\nto murder the top ten.\nRough and rugged and raw\nI'm like a callous.\nThe underground can say\n\"ain't no Fra-zontin in my palace.\"\n\nWell can I be the flavor of the month?\nI got the flavor\nplus I can bump a chump.\nI got the funk\nstraight from my underground hide-out.\nI freak it in the house\nand let the hits just\nooz out.\nBust on the scene\nto let ya know I wasn't frontin.\nGot ya screamin for my album\nso I had to do somethin.\nWrite tonight\nto take a bit\nnot a bite.\nAnd watch the (?)\nfreak you with\nall my might.\nLike \"Here I am to save the day!\"\nI stop the tracks\nwith the mic\nso I say \"To chay\"\nand \"On Gaurd\"\nwhen I'm swingin for your brow.\nCause in the house of hits\nain't no frontin allowed.\n\nJust when you thought\nthat it was safe\nto try and chop me.\nRun for ya life\nnow here somes Mr. Funky\nand I'm pissed.\nSo watch how many heads\nI'll be the takeout\nboy ya better look out\nI work ya like a cook-out.\nSo get the flavor\nthe original Mr. Funky\n(?)\nand you watch me do my thing.\nBecause I hit ya with the funk\nof the fly-talker\nand make your girl\n\"Bump-bump! Get it, Get it!\"\nlike Luke Skywalker.\nI can't front\nI love rappin with a passion.\nCrash your head front\ninto the funk\nyou think I'm slam dancin.\nSee when you front\nyou make mad\nthe alter weight (?).\nFreak this:\n\"funky twin powers activate!\"\nSheik on the mic\nwith the cape and muscles.\nCrushin MC's\nwhile their girls do the hustle.\nSee other rappers\ntry to dis the lords\nbut yo, your dead wrong.\nDamnit, can't we all just get along?\nWe'll see\nthere simply ain't no frontin allowed.\nYo, I'm out\nlike the Cosby show\npeace to the Funky Child.\n\nPunchin your god-damn eyebrows off\nroughin it up north\nlookin' like your laugh off (?).\nIt's a blash smash\nand crash from my stash.\nBe watchin your back kid.\nYour girl and the phat path.\nTalkin bout your macks and tax.\nWhat's with that?\nYour gettin wet like\nsloooow sex.\nRippin on that old school kid.\nLeavin sliced as a slit\nsays I wet your crib.\nNo question.\nTestin the west\nand the east and\nonce the ammo was released and\nI'll make your girl come and getcha.\nHope you get the picture.\nBoy your better off\nif a pit bit ya!\nWhat's its like\nin the illest fight.\nBelieve the hype.\nI'm givin crowds more nose jobs than Mike.\nFight sight alright\nthey bite\nspot light tonight\nis hype\ntrigger happy tripe\ndon't hit bite\nmy owner's right.\nAnd ya know it's comin off\nso don't ask it.\nSnatchin the vocal\nand hotties on the rap tip.\nMackin ya boys up.\nBringin the noise up.\nAnd now ya need stitches\nbecause my voice cuts.\nChainsaw\ngain more\nand riegn raw.\nAnd never let a brother play it\nis my main law.\n",
