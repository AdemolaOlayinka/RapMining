(Cool J, uh)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Hit it)\n\n\nNewcomers, step on back and if you hid last summer\ncatch a heart-attack, cause I'm back\nI'm bad, you write rhymes made are blad\nI'm mad cause they said I wasn't bad\nNo recognition cause they said I'm from the ghetto\nCarryin' nine millimeters and stiletto's\nI guess I need a TV show to get mine\nBut I don't feel like kissin' no director's behind\nThat's too soft for L\nI'ma write a rhyme-fighter inside of the rebel \"Yell\"\nHour jack loops and dancer troops\nWatch out for the gangsta-machine-gun-loose\n\n\nAin't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNo way, huh, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\n\n\nLast year pop rappers got awards\nAnd don't know a damn thing about a block party mic-cord\nThey see LL, they know the brothers' real\nBut the flies can tell you exactly how they feel\nWhen I come in the door it's like I'm made of dynamite\nI gotta blow up more and more\nShakin' the rafters from here on after\nPuttin' an end to all the laughter\nThere ain't no way they can win\nwith the band all in, plus the turntable spin\nStrip-searchin' competition, you can call 'em competition\nbut there ain't no competition cause I'm on a mission\nI'ma rip this game, I want the soul train families and anybody with a name\nSuperstars step aside this year\nAnd all you other little crumbs that wanna try and come near\nI'm sick and tired of political setbacks\nToo much red tape-the-box, so forget that\n\n\nAin't no stoppin' this\nAin't no stoppin' this\nAin't no stoppin' this\nI'm comin', huh, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNuh-uh, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this, don't stop\n\n\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, hah)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, yeah)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J, uh)\nParty people are you with me? (Cool J)\n\n\nI started in the basement of my grandmother's house\nMy rap got gashed, your whole body's' gettin' doubts\nBurnt to a crisp, lead from the mist\nThird degree and Gods' my only witness\nWhen I shocked the world, hold the prince hostage\nfor the diamonds and pearls\nMaker-Mike will remember the time\ntellin' Madonna black love ain't a crime\nI'm like a shogun, I ain't scared of no-one\nBorn and raised in New York, that's where I come from\n\n\nAin't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\nUh, come on, hah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNah, nah, ain't no stoppin' this\nNever, ever, no, ain't no stoppin' this\n\n(Yeah, uh, hah, yeah)\n\n\nI rip downtown, uptown\nI love the way the bass sound, when I'm underground\nBoulevard to boulevard, avenue to avenue, I'll be havin' you\nPlayin' a scene to a song so mean that'll get\nyour whole car rockin' like a war machine\nNeighbors downstairs call current-affairs\nCause the party got ripped and yours truly was there\n\n\nAin't no stoppin' this\n1984, ain't no stoppin' this\n1985, ain't no stoppin' this\n1986, ain't no stoppin' this\n1987, ain't no stoppin' this\n1988, ain't no stoppin' this\n1989, ain't no stoppin' this\n1990, ain't no stoppin' this\n91, ain't no stoppin' this\n92, what to do?\n\n1993 and all that, infinity, power of God rules\n",
