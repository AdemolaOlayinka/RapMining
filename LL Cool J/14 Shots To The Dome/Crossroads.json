Cryin' in a childless (?) tone\nterrified of dyin' a painful death alone.\nDon't smile\nlest a innocent (?) chile\nThe power of god is gonna get to be your tal (?).\nThrow like a hit from the best\ntake it in a slump\nha ha\nfeel it in your chest.\nConquerin the world with the words\nleadin the children like herds.\nI can feel it buildin\nI'm about to explode\nI'm walkin on the crossroad\n\nPeople livin in a shack - at the crossroads\nLittle kids sellin crack - at the crossroads\n(?) stab you in the back - at the crossroads\nEverybodies gettin jacked at the crossroads\nViolins and trumpets play\n25 thousand people in a golden sleigh\non there way to the promise land.\nDeliverance\nbut yet some don't understand.\nRough on a late night thrill\nafter midnight\nkill or be killed.\nSoldiers, warriors\n(?) at each other\non the combat zone.\nSupreme power on the throne.\nLighting strikes in every home.\nTerrified men run down the street.\nSo many dead bodies\nit's hard to eat.\nCome, we gotta rise\nabove the wall.\nTo see what no man has seen before.\nBlindin' light\nthat got you through the night.\nGod is on your side\nto got in a fight.\n\nHomicide\nsuicide\ndeath.\nBOOM!\nAin't nobody left.\nOhhhh! It's startin to take affect.\nYour on your knees\nyou scared to death.\nTornados with a thousand people spinnin.\nOne fight at the cross\nand now god is winin.\nThe whole Earth cracks in half.\nThe sea turns red from the blood bath.\nAbandoned buildings burned\nand two remain (?).\nTerrified\nyou feel the fire blaze.\nThe ground can't hold your weight.\nYou reach out to grab the pearly gates.\nWho clocked this f***\nnot from space.\nNever again\nwill you see the human race.\n19 angels leadin the devil straight to hell!\nTorment!\nPain!\nWhat you're seein here\nyou can't explain.\nAll your life\nsome men\nwe played the game.\nNever realize that there's a flame.\n",
