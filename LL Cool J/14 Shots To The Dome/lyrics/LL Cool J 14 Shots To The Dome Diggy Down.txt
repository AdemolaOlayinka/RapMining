Diggedy down, down just look around, my world is goin' down
Disease is spreadin' everywhere, I can-cannot be found
This, the season for murder - isn't no reason
to hurt another brother but temptation is so pleasin'
And every alley-way, they're gettin' high
On playgrounds they're sellin' crack and every day another baby dies
Pistol whippin', kidnappin', anything can happen
Diggedy down, diggedy down with Old Trafford

Young people, with no education, politicians, deny and segregation
Young infants, deserted and abandoned
Step parents, lack in understandin'
Homelessness, all across the land, war, man against man
Treachery and evil fillin' our communities
and all these hypocrites, aiyyo, they're stealin' from our charities

Many poisonous chemicals and (uh) boom!
Many devilish goals are up (uh) soon!
No love where loves' ya dwell in
Mother-earth transformed into hell an'
Ice, murders, conspiracy and (uh) schemes!
Young boys will reveal their, dreams!
Handguns in the hands of the young
and diss all this paranoia, yo, there's much slugs for everyone
