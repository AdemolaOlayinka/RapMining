14 Shots To The Dome
1993)
The wind is howlin
the rain pours down
eyes are blood-shot
heartbeat pounds.
Lights go out 
the whole world's in darkness
the ground is tremblin'
dogs are barkless.
In the sky there appears a great light
burnin' all the flesh off the creatures of the night.
AAAHHHH!  Cryin' in a childless (?) tone
terrified of dyin' a painful death alone.
Don't smile
lest a innocent (?) chile
The power of god is gonna get to be your tal (?).
Throw like a hit from the best
take it in a slump
ha ha 
feel it in your chest.
Conquerin the world with the words
leadin the children like herds.
I can feel it buildin
I'm about to explode
I'm walkin on the crossroad

People livin in a shack - at the crossroads
Little kids sellin crack - at the crossroads
(?) stab you in the back - at the crossroads
Everybodies gettin jacked at the crossroads
Violins and trumpets play
25 thousand people in a golden sleigh
on there way to the promise land.
Deliverance
but yet some don't understand.
Rough on a late night thrill
after midnight
kill or be killed.
Soldiers, warriors 
(?) at each other 
on the combat zone.
Supreme power on the throne.
Lighting strikes in every home.
Terrified men run down the street.
So many dead bodies 
it's hard to eat.
Come, we gotta rise
above the wall.
To see what no man has seen before.
Blindin' light
that got you through the night.
God is on your side
to got in a fight.

Homicide
suicide
death.
BOOM!
Ain't nobody left.
Ohhhh! It's startin to take affect.
Your on your knees
you scared to death.
Tornados with a thousand people spinnin.
One fight at the cross
and now god is winin.
The whole Earth cracks in half.
The sea turns red from the blood bath.
Abandoned buildings burned
and two remain (?).
Terrified 
you feel the fire blaze.
The ground can't hold your weight.
You reach out to grab the pearly gates.
Who clocked this f***
not from space.
Never again
will you see the human race.
19 angels leadin the devil straight to hell!
Torment!
Pain!
What you're seein here 
you can't explain.
All your life
some men 
we played the game.
Never realize that there's a flame.
