Lil' Mo\nYeahh.. yeahh... yeahhh....ohh oh\n\nWhen I cry baby you cry\nWhen we cry baby, it's like\nYou know, ohh oh\nHow love goes, say it again\nWhen I cry baby you cry\nWhen we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh)\nYou know (Ohh oh) how love goes (Now give it to em)\n\nHow ever it go I'm going out for ya girl,\nIf I'm a stick up kid I'm pullin' out for ya girl,\nIf I was hustling I'd pump coke for ya girl,\nIf I was a dred then I'd smoke for ya girl,\nI play captain,rock the boat for ya girl,\nI play martin and bring hope to ya girl,\nWhen I was away look how I wrote to ya girl,\nWasn't I polite when I spoke to ya girl,\nTricked on you cop that coke for you girl,\nI'd do anything but go broke for ya girl,\nSince I'm a rapper I wrote a song for ya girl,\nSince I'm a gun clapper I keep it warm for ya girl,\nLift some weights and keep it hard for ya girl,\nSunday morning pray to God for you girl,\nIf that don't work catch a charge for ya girl,\nOr flip some bars become a star for ya girl,\n\nWhen I cry baby, you cry (You cry)\nWhen we cry baby, it's like\nYou know ohh oh\nHow love goes\nCome on say it again\nWhen I cry baby you cry (Babyyyy)\nWhen we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh)\nYou know (Ohh oh) how love goes\n(Just how love goes)\n\nIf I was a pastor I'd preach for ya girl,\nIf I was a hand then I'd reach for ya girl,\nGrab a broom and sweep the streets for ya girl,\nBecome the President and get in peace for ya girl,\nI keep having these visions in my mind,\nNo since, no reason, no rhyme,\nSchizophrenia is hard to define,\nLife's a mountain for you,I'm ready to climb,\nBecome the sun for you I shine,\nMuch more than all your other guys combined,\nSo you can tell them all to wait in line,\nCoz a crime of passions still a crime,\nLife ain't a movie girl you cant rewind,\nBut I play any role just to make you mine,\nEven in the mirror you're one of a kind,\nAnd I don't need nobody else to co-sign,\n\nWhen I cry baby, you cry (You cry)\nWhen we cry baby, it's like (o o oh o)\nYou know (Ohh oh)\nHow love goes\nSay it again\nWhen I cry baby you cry (Woo woo wo ow)\nWhen we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh)\nYou know (Ohh oh) how love goes\n(Just how love goes)\nTake it to the bridge,\n\nThere ain't nothin' I wouldn't do,\nI cook and clean when it comes to you,\nI keep it locked don't ever fear,\nWhen it comes to my man imma be right here,\nKeep it hustle when times are tough,\nNever left me stranded it was all about us,\nKept coming home,\nKept running strong,\nThis love is meant to be life long,\n\nLife is good when it's me and you together,\nAnd when there's drama then imma do what ever,\nKeep you warm in the stormy cold weather,\nLeave you broken and lonely Oh never,\nEvery work that I say is so clever,\nWhen you feel it in your heart it gets you much wetter,\nI am the original go getter,\nI don't waste time fronting I go get her,\nStare at the devil and won't blink for ya girl,\nChange the way that I think for ya girl,\nPut it on paper waste the ink for ya girl,\nWalk through the dessert without a drink for ya girl,\nCentral booking, rock pink for ya girl,\nStep in quicksand and sink for ya girl,\nWhatever the obstacle imma leap for ya girl,\nEnd my life and go to sleep for ya girl,\n\nWhen I cry baby, you cry (You cry)\nWhen we cry baby, it's like (Yeahh)\nYou know you know (Ohh oh)\nHow love goes\nWhen I cry baby you cry\nWhen we cry baby it's like (Yeahhh)\nYou know (Ohh oh) how love goes\n(Just how love goes)\n",
