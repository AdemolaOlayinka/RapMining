    "lyrics": "Ain't nobody as hot as us\nEast side, west side, north side, south side\nLet's ride, uh, the GOAT is now taking over the building\nIt's time for some of that ol', that good ol'\nYankee up north Dirty south, Yankee music\nUh, it ain't where you from, homey\nIt's how hot you are, Nicolette, let's -- come on\n\n\nI be that, girl who straight pop from the N.Y.\nDoing my thing, all day, yeah it's her\nNicolette on the track, matter fact, bring it back\nTell me what you think about her\nWho you know wit a flow so loco\nOn a dirty south track from the N.Y. though\nI be on it, I be on it, ya'll cats don't really want it\nYa'll don't want it, ya'll just fronting, homeboy, then back up off me\nI'm a young fly soldier, thought I told ya, wack cats is gon' be over\nI'm a supernova, controller, anything that I get I hold up\nI'm a supernova, controller, anything that I get I hold up\nTake it back up to the N.Y., show 'em how we do, what we do and why\nKeep ballin' in our ride, driving show, I pass 'em by\nYou see our paper, haters hating but it's still all good\nAnd if you looking for me, you can catch me in my hood\nJust doing my thing, got the ring bling, don't get it misunderstood\nNicolette, LL, on the same track, bring it back, tell me what you\nthink about that\nBoys trynna holla, but I ain't having that\nYou better have game, you better come correct\nYa Girl Nicolette, don't like lame cats\nTell me what you think about that, let's go\n\n\nLove that you made money, really don't matter\nIf I see her from a far, this what I yell at her\nHey, over there, over there\nHo, get over here, get over here\nIn your club with your girls, I'm in here with my mans\nWon't your girls meet my boys, we can all be friends\nHey, over there, over there\nHo, get over here, get over here\n\n\nGot to get it popping, the track is knocking, the Bentley's rocking\nOverdose I'm suppose to roast 'em, with every bar I'm dropping\nEvery time I drop they copping, every single line I lay is locking\nYou a hater, boy, stop your plotting, it'll be your blood we mopping\nTalk about that major flavor, keyed up, cut like a razor\nLyrically I stake and bake ya, you can see I get that paper\nWear jet black like Darth Vader, hopping out on playa haters\nIt's in my n-n-nature, never been a smoother operator\nSwitch it up, hit it up, get it up, let it up\nYour girl from the back, like giddy up\nHow come I run, you like my son, I blow the whole god damn city up\nInside that long white milky Bentley like I just picked Diddy up\nThink about that while you doubt that, you a fake mac, you can't count that\nHop all off then I bounce back, got 'em looking a wolf pack outback\nI'm from where them GOAT GOAT, shout that\nAsk Master P, I'm bout that\nEverybody know I'm holding, in the party, pocket swollen\nRock and rolling, competition catching coals in they colon\n\n\n\n\nWhat up ya'll, ya'll know us\nKnow the party ain't ill til we show up\nOnce we hit the scene, the chicks go nuts\nSorry if I intervene, ma, but so what\nPour more cups of the drink, cups of the guz stop\nTil I'm all drunk in the place, burn the kush to the face\nMaking the dudes wanna hate, cuz we them new dudes in the state\n\n\nYeah, we in the club just chilling, B, yeah, baby feeling me\nFeel like a barbecue, shorty keep grilling me up\nIn the club doing stacks where a ceiling be\nDo it well, ask LL dog feeling me\nDudes not feeling me, because we walked in the door\nLooking flyer than airplanes, it's not touching the floor\n\n\nIt do what it do, get the flow get you, and it move\nThe body move to the tune, yessir\nDJ let it boom in the room\nShit's just there, like and now your boy here\n\n\nWe hot like June, gon' drop real soon let 'em know that Queens in the house\nWe jam ride from to the north to the side, I'm a young back, just shut\nyour mouth\nShut your mouth, turn it around, shake a little bit, drop down to the ground\nMost of the time, don't stop or pound, before we wasn't it but be popping now\nPopping now, people love us when we dropping the sound\nCome to your hood, we be rocking your town\nGo to the show we rocking the crowd, get gwop by the thou', wow\n\n\nCome on and roll wit the kid, back to the crib\nCar real fast, bed real big\nJust like that, I'mma get them stacks\nGot 'em screaming out, my neck, my back\nWork it all night, this ain't no tease\nYou gonna be scarred, I'mma sweat that weave\nNow you can't drive, it's too much speed\nJust sit back and enjoy that breeze\nIn the whip today, but not tomorrow\nThat's the life of a superstar\nWanna be involved, better be aware\nTicky Diamondz got women everywhere\nDo it on the floor, stairs to the chair\nDo it on the beat, please, hands to stare\nGot you on the beach, you out somewhere\nGot your girl screaming that it ain't that fair\nBaby come true, got enough bread\nSwitch to the truck, nothing more said\nKid don't play, just do clean\nThat's what it is, when I come from Queens\nDo my lean, big black truck\nComing through like I'm moving that stuff\nI just get checks, just get neck\nGirls I'm afraid, running round butt nake\nGotta go, back to the grind\nBack to the tracks, back to the rhymes\nBurn a little haze, I let my rhyme --\n",
