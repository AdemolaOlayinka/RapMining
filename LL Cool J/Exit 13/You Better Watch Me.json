I'll keep on cakin'\nYou can't compare me to them line for line\nI'm beyond that I represent ? of time\nClassic my style can't be defined\nI'll be relavent forever, get it through your mind\nJust watch me\n\n\n\n\n(I see you)\nTwo steppin in the club\nWith my L in the air\nAnd a bottle of bub\n(I see you)\nTwo steppin in the club\nWith my L in the air\nAnd a bottle of bub\n(I see you)\nTwo steppin in the club\nWith my L in the air\nAnd a bottle of bub\n(I see you)\nTwo steppin in the club\nWith my L in the air\nAnd a bottle of bub\n(I see you)\n\n\nBack on the scene, back reppin queens\nTurnin Def Jam back into a marketing machine\nNow we talkin autographs, cheers and laughs\nI got interns tellin niggas kiss they ass\nCause we back on top, ain't nobody this high\nJust them niggas is mad whether they say it or not (haha)\nI thought i told ya that we don't top\nTell all them sucka MC's jump on the jock\nAnd watch me\n\nL's up\nPut ya L's up\nCome on\nL's up\nPut ya L's up\nCome on\nL's up\nPut ya L's up\nCome on\nL's up\nPut ya L's up\nCome on, yeah\n",
