They tell you L goin hard\nI got my mojo back, I'm seein mo' dough black\nMy face on promo wraps, I'm seein fo' mo' plaques\nThe way the paper stack, I'm okay with that\nShe's so smart in my lap, she's a brainiac\nWe roll around in the sack, laugh and spillin the 'gnac\nI'm the dog killin the cat, ignorin the jack\nThis is flawless rap, you can't call this whack\nWhere the ballers at? Go 'head, throw up a stack\nThis is simply facts, I got the gift to mack\nI take this to the max, what'chu know about that?\n",
