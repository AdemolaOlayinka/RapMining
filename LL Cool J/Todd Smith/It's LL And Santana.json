This is for my down South trappers\nMy midwest slabbers - ya dig?\nAy! Yup yup, this is for my East coast slangers\nMy West coast bangers - ya dig?\n\n\n\n\nVV9 Vanquishes\nNever lunchin, I hit your honey with these languages (I'm about that)\nWarto, Bertaliano, Cancerilli{?}\nNeck shinin, my diamonds purple as grape jelly (I'm about that)\nThorough get yo' bread perspective\nDon't forget to set your Tivo, my my game's perfected (I'm about that)\nRainbow ice, you confidant talk politely\nLeave the party with your wifey, so don't invite me\nBang one of them joints from New Orleans\nJuvey hustle harder, Birdman you still boring\nNorthside (Ch-ch-ch-choppin the ? of my gold rims)\nSouthside (Ch-ch-ch-choppin the ? of my gold rims) - you about that?\nHow I'm beamin in the Beemer\nBounce wit'cha honey have you singin \"Have you seen her?\"\nUhh, have you seen her\nL put in work, gospel - church!\n",
