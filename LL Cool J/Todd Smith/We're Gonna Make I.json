Hangin on a tight rope, fingers slippin off\nBut you ain't by yourself dawg, we all been lost\nStay on your course, carry your cross\nAin't no stoppin, got to keep it poppin\nYou want it, you can get it, believe me the king did it\nNothin gonna hold you back, there's no limits\nI'm sent to bring truth to rap, not gimmicks\nAnd I'm not finished, man listen\nHere's the moral to the thesis, y'all cats need Jesus\nHe put your life back together, pick up the pieces\nWord to the masses, I heard God asked us\nfor less fake rappers, and more real pastors\nUh-huh, uh-huh, so hereafter\n\n\n\n\nWe made it, we made it\nThrough the storm and rain, yeahhhhhhh\nYou can make it, yes you can\nYou can make it, you got me\nI know you can, I know you can\nI know you can, yessssss, yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nI do believe we'll make it (Hallelujah!)\n(Glory! Glory!)\n",
