    "lyrics": "Just starin at these four walls closin\nIn on me, feelin like time's frozen\nFadin in and out, noddin and dozin\nGuilt tearin up my brain like erosion\nWhat I did to you was wrong I admit it\nI regret that I did it like a junkie when he's jonzin\nAll alone in what used to be a home\nBut you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in\nThe voicemail that you left me was scoldin\nHot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron\nCause it was all true, that's why we all through\nNow your girl's pickin up the cell when I call you\nTalkin slick like she ain't here\nShe don't want you no more, punk disappear - click\nI need to hit her with a brick\nBut that'll only lead me to a worse predicament\nI hope your girlfriend ain't got you on a liquor binge\nWith her bitter attitude just cause she's sick of men\nBut I'ma keep on callin, fightin 'til the end\nOn my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again\n\n\nI sit in front of yo' crib in the pourin rain\nWhylin out screamin yo' name\nAnd keepin ringin yo' bell 'til you mad as hell\nAnd call the po'-po', I ain't afraid (yeah, yeah)\nYou can get yo' folks and yo' cousins and them\nAnd try to run me off yo' blocka (uh-huh)\nBut I ain't scared, I ain't goin nowhere\nAnd I ain't stoppin 'til I gotcha\nTo show you I changed shawty\n\n\nI seen you at the movies with some tall cat\nSo I bust his headlights with a ball bat\nWhen I was with you he would give me dap and all that\nNow you in his arms in the mall, what you call that?\nThat's what I get for creepin and crawlin\nEvery other weekend gone until the mornin\nSneakin out to my dirt, dead wrong\nComin back past dawn with the guilty mask on\nAnd I never counted the cost, took heed to warnings\nTry to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn\nAnd it don't feel nice, when you wake up nights\nShakin in cold sweats and your whole life's a wreck\nThat was the old me, the one I still regret\nThe one you couldn't respect, the one you should forget\nBut I'ma keep on callin, fightin 'til the end\nOn my knees 'til they bleed, to prove my love again\n\n\n\n\nTo show you I changed shawty\nI really did change shawty (I'M TELLIN YOU I'VE CHANGED)\nI wanna show you I changed shawty\n(I STILL LOVE YOU!)\n\n\nI don't care if the cops got me surrounded\nSWAT teams whatever, tell 'em to send the hounds in\nMy mind's in an altered state\nLike I'm headed for a wall, top speed, foot off the brake\nI make a fool of myself, girl whatever it takes\nI already played the fool when I let you escape\nYou're as, good as it gets, your friendship your sex\nEverything about you and yours connects\nFrom your, beautiful smile to the scent of your skin\nThe sheets smell different, this is not livin\nIt feels like dyin, God knows I'm tryin\nAin't no sight sadder than a grown man cryin\nPlease find it in your heart to forgive me\nRealize only God can convict me\nWe all make mistakes, so have you\nIf God show mercy on me, then you should too\n\n\n\n\nTo show you I changed shawty\nI really did change shawty (I'M TELLIN YOU I'VE CHANGED)\nI wanna show you I changed shawty\n(I STILL LOVE YOU!) OWW!\n(I'M TELLIN YOU I'VE CHANGED)\n",
