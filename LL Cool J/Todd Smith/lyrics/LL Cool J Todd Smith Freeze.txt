I know I said I would roll with you,
Put my lifestyle on hold for you,
All them sweet things that I told you...
This conversation is overdue...
FREEZE!

Getting too wild to respect the vow,
I just ain't ready to settle down,
My name too big in the ghetto now...
FREEZE!

Feels like i'm ready when i'm holding you,
But it's so many honey's what i'm sposed to do?
Keep sending them apology notes to you?
FREEZE!

All I need is for you to freeze,
This is hard on me,
I don't wanna leave,
But in the mean time take back the keys and...
FREEZE!

Don't change...
Don't go...
Don't leave...
Just FREEZE!
I know girl it's alot to ask!
Tell me what other choice I have,
When you love someone this bad...
Just FREEZE!
Don't change...
Don't go...
Don't leave...
Just FREEZE!
Girl I hope you understand,
Promise I'll be back for you,
When I become a better man...

Why I gotta do this?
I ain't sure...
Why I gotta wild out?
Iono...
I kno how it feels,
I been hurt before...
I kno you disappointed you expected more...
FREEZE!

I'm loosing a good one and that's fo'sho,
I be tryina fight but it calls me yo...
Please don't change the locks on tha door...
FREEZE!

Quit cryin cause it ain't yo fault,
Blame it on the streets of New York...
Young L gotta walk this walk girl...
FREEZE!

I kno it's rough but I need your support,
You said it all last time that we faught,
So don't talk baby hold that thought and...
FREEZE!

Don't change...
Don't go...
Don't leave...
Just FREEZE!

What would you think if I told you that I...
Knew that I was breaking your heart,
Want to explain but where should I start?
What would you think if I told you that I...
Wake up every morning with a different girl,
Cause I don't wanna settle down before I see the world!
What would you think if I told you that I...
Know exactly what you need indeed,
Hate to follow but i'm scared to lead...
Too scared love will get the best of me...
I know deep down by the zest of me...
Hopefully some day I can give you that ring...
But until then just do this one thing...
FREEZE!

Don't change...
Don't go...
Don't leave...

Matter of fact I promise you...
But for right now I just need you to...
FREEZE!
