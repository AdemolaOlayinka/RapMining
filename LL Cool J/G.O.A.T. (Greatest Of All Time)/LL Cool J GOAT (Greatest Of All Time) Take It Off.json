Kelly had the house on the hill\nWell when the partys over we can go there and chill\nIn London it's Big Ben style breakfast in bed\nIn Paris you were on an Eifel Tower givin' me head\nGo to Switzerland, private jets over the house\nCome home, ghetto style, bend you over the couch\nReal niggaz, nothin' but the platnium shit\nKeep that ass soakin wet, plus I'm spendin' his chips\nWho's fuckin' wit that, put your middle finger in the air\nHas a jet pasion X-man playin' wit your hair\n\n\n\nTake it off, Come on and dance with me baby\nTake it off, There aint nobody who can fade me\nTake it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately\nTake it off, You know that ass look crazy\nTake it off, You saw me up in that mercedes\nTake it off, I know my crew look shady\nTake it off, You see me spendin' dubs baby\nTake it off, Watch me dance for you baby\nDance for me baby (x4)\n\nTo my man Black Jus baby RIP\nAccesory to the crime is the prime dogg 3\nWhen we get the money baby, spreadin' the cream\nTo tell your brother Joe to hold it down for Queens\nAnd to my cousin Will, hold ya head nigga chill\nJ.T. Damon in the car let's get the squeels\nMy nigga Big Bonny Puff, glad your home\nRock the bells Melly Mell, Jimmy Love and Tone\nBaby we live cats, lookin' at where in we rides at\nDrug walls, hip-hop beats, how 'bout that\nThe rest fell so far, they can't climb back\nLet's take it to the video-tape, rewind that\n\n\n\nTake it off, Come on and dance with me baby (everybody in the club)\nTake it off, There aint nobody who can fade me (word up)\nTake it off, I'm on a hot-streak lately\n(champagne glass in the air baby)\nTake it off, You know that ass look crazy\n(Just wanna pop it dog, word up)\nTake it off, You saw me up in that mercedes (yeah yeah)\nTake it off, I know my crew look shady (it's official, word up)\nTake it off, You see me spendin' dubs baby\nTake it off, Watch me dance for you baby\n\nTake it off, Greatest of All Times.\n",
