    "lyrics": "I just want you to fantasize with imagination\nKnow what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah\nUh, yeah I like that\nGive me some more, some more of my vocals\nYou know sex 'em up a little bit\nYou know what I mean?\n\nYou're the honey that I see when I'm riding by\nThe one giving me a feeling that I can't deny\nYou got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh\nActing like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye\nSometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror\nTurn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer\nYou're turning me on, keep me standing up\nI wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough\nI come up to your job and handcuff your boss\nThrow that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off\nThen sit you up on the copy machine\nMake copies of your kitten with my chin in between\nThen I'll take you to the window so the world can see\nBaby I'm down on my knees let your world be free\nPearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me\nMultiple orgasms is your destiny\nWet dream, ride like you're going to Queens\nLike I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18\nTo hell with your boss\nLet that nigga hear you scream\nSounding like that screech on the fax machine\nThen we can take it to the ladies bathroom\nMake your mascara run till you look like a racoon\nTouch yourself baby tell me it's wet\nSqueeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go\n\n\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\n\n\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine\n(Uh-uh)\n\nUh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school\nYou've been a bad girl you broke all the rules\nForgot your homework, chewed gum in class\nAnd the only way to fix it is to give me some ass\nI got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk\nI kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh\nYou're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks\nThe vibe is thick baby, we both red hot\nI kiss your neck unbutton your blouse\nLet my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth\nYour apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life\nGot your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight\nYou could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey\nBut no Trojan soldier scold you like me\nMatch the calculus then measure my frequency\nBut when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree\nPut your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails\nGive me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples\nBaby feel me now you got yo ass suspended\nGot a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it\nI stopped by the crib you invited me in\nYou convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin\nThen you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back\nYou twisting, kissing ya fist like that\nRubber meets the road till the tire goes flat\nI filled it up with air again baby hold that\nYou a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet\nSqueeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet\n\n\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\n\n\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine\n(Uh-uh)\n\nYou was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink\nWhen I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink\nGuided you to the dance floor and held you tight\nWe in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights\nI'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice\nYou rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes\nThe club is so black we can't see our own hands\nI know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants\nYou bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands\nRub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it\nGod gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it\nLife is a song, you were born to perform it\nDrink the Cristal at the same time\nGet intoxicated till we lose are minds\nThe crowd seperated as we start to shine\nI lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb\nWe tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd\nThe lights start to flash the music is too loud\nWe hit the back door and jump in the limousine\nYou pull up your skirt I put some ice in between\nYou're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet\nEven though we outside I hear the bass from the beat\nFunkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks\nDJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep\nNo problem uh mi spouse no aqui\nTu muy caliente tu vamos con mi\nSi mami I'm the chaffer make it whip\nTake a ride bet you never forget\nHere we go\n\n\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\n\n\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine\n(Uh-uh)\n",
