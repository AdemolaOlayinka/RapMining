LL Cool J
Authentic
2013)
It's L to the L and Cool to the J
This is just how we funk today
And when it's time for us to get
Know what I mean?

Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that
Feel me... Feel me
Keep them ordinary chicks away
Get up out my face
Feel me... Feel me
Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me
Like fo real though

All this fraudulent shinin
And imitation diamonds is damn near blinding
Every time leave the country
I gotta come back foreign just to remind ya
Know they watchin my moves but they never figure out exactly how I'm grindin
I needs rock to my ears
They say the bands look at the finest
No captains, funny
Flashing this money like you taking something from me
Girl gave me the eye, this dude's a dummy
Don't play boy, I'll bag yo lil bunny
Chain around my neck made the night look sunny
Game so cold, your crew knows it's runny
L's in the building, you know that kid
'Cause 100 for yo nose, baby blow that quick

Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that
Feel me... Feel me
Keep them ordinary chicks away
Get up out my face
Feel me... Feel me
Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me

Hold and grow, dipped in what
Get a grip then flip, grip the dick, Heathcliff
The giff, the gaff, the riff, the raff
I'm slick with the bit when I pin it to
I'm attracted swag or the crip Louie bags
La di da and my Adidas
Get out for shizzey, just say you never pissey
You'll never as cool as me, cool, chill back

Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that
Feel me... Feel me
Keep them ordinary chicks away
Get up out my face
Feel me... Feel me
Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me

Yea, this the same old script
LL Jordan, white riders on tip
Proving every rapper in the game can't spit
You gon turn around and get yo forehead split
Finish with the workout, I might blow the splif
Young girls talking bout â€“ Hi, Mister Smith
Quick baby, put the Maserati in 5th
Brim on the 80 ave, lookin all stiff
LL, boy where you been?
Without you in the game how the coach gon win?
Call Snoop Dogg, it's time to go in
Tell my man Bootsy bring the big mouths in
Step on the parkay, you know I'm gon win
It's tight balling, you can't defend
If money is stacked up, Cool's locked in
Ya'll get the message, I ain't gotta press send

Forget yo swag (Forget yo swag)
Feel me... Feel me
Got money, I don't care bout that
I don't care about that
Feel me... Feel me
Keep them ordinary chicks away
Get up out my face
Feel me... Feel me
Bring another hundred bottles a day
Bartender please
Feel me... Feel me
