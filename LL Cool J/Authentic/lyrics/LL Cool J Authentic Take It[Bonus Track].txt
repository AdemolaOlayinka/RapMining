LL Cool J
Authentic
2013)
I'ma do the whole joint again
Looking at my Rollie, it's about that time
For me to paint pictures on the walls in your mind
These quality masterpieces are hard to find
That's why from 6 to 9 they stand online
I feel like an underdog coming from behind
Pressure bus pipes, relax you'll be fine
LL got the remedy intervention divine
I gave you the gift of missing me, it's all by design
(When you're talking) it's a privilege to be mine
(For your loving) I put it all on the line
All night you can cum, all day you can shop
Let the bells jingling and let the champagne pop
Twelve to six, six to nine
Round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Let me love you babe
I won't make you wait
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Ignore the clock, it's time to make the bed rock
It's hood, we don't even hear the sirens and gunshots
I'm stroking, you're floating and what not
Skin sticky but no hickies, better not
The tension's high, I'm outside the box
A pin in her balloon without making it pop
It feels like New Year's but two balls drop
Almost at the top, now you begging me to stop
(When you're talking) it's a privilege to be mine
(For your loving) I put it all on the line
All night you can cum, all day you can shop
Let the bells jingling and let the champagne pop
Twelve to six, six to nine
Round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Let me love you babe
I won't make you wait
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take a ride, look down at my eyes
Flooded like my chain I can drown in your thighs
A little bit of pain brings joy to your life
Lay your head back, relax and get right
Souls unify beneath the moonlight
It's only you and I, no other invites
I want to see you naked, watch you take it
I'm elated and so are you
Twelve to six, six to nine
Round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Let me love you babe
I won't make you wait
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Twelve to six, six to nine
Round the clock don't run and hide
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Let me love you babe
I won't make you wait
Can you take it (take it) take it (take it)
Take it (take it) take it (take it)
Sometimes I got to give you the gift of missing me
For you to appreciate what you got, you know what I mean
