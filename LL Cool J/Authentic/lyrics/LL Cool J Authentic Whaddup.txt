(I say whaddup?)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose (I say whaddup?)
It's your ticket (Whaddup?)
Hear the drummer get wicked (I said whaddup?)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose (I say whaddup?)
It's your ticket (Whaddup?)
Hear the drummer get wicked (Whaddup?)


Time to put em in the dirt, somebody get hurt
Hard time, it's rough (Whaddup?)
I took a look at my life, it cuts like a knife
What I have is not enough (Whaddup?)
I got a lot on my mind, cross the line
Homeboy, I cut you up (Whaddup?)
No reason to bribe, I'll 'pose the nine
You'll lose your mind. I said (whaddup?)

Z-Trip, get wicked (Whaddup?)

Hard-hard-hard as hell
Battle-battle anybody
Rock-rock-rock-rock the bells

I can't take it no more, my nerve's so raw
This economy is outta control (Whaddup?)
Kick down your door, put the whipper to your jaw
This time, it's moral (Whaddup?)
I feel so hard, oh my God
Come back and save my soul (Whaddup?)
Never settle for the silver motherfucker in the Bronx
Know my style, give me that gold (Whaddup?)
I came to test ya, under pressure
Let's see if ya balls gon' fall (Whaddup?)
I'll take you mind, now is the time
Hungry, you've been told (Whaddup?)
I've been fighting for my dream my whole life
But this day-to-day grind gets on (Whaddup?)
East-to-West Coast-al, going postal
Action, who wants that roll?

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose (I said whaddup?)
It's your ticket (Whaddup?)
Hear the drummer get wicked (I said whaddup?)
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose (I said whaddup?)

Bring-bring-bring-bring the noise


Release the beast, where's my feast?
Feed my hunger pains (Whaddup?)
Kids got to eat, no defeat
My turn to take your brains (Whaddup?)
Shoot the ring, off the king
I have perfect aim (Whaddup?)
And what I bring, is gonna swing
The world like a hurricane (Whaddup?)
I'm gonna show you, what it feels like to go through
The bullshit that I've been through, it would make you mental
It's time to lay down, take off the crown
Business, not a game
Heart stop the pound, the time is now
We gotta break these fucking chains
