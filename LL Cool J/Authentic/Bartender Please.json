Feel me\nGot money, I don't care bout that\nI don't care about that\nFeel me... Feel me\nKeep them ordinary chicks away\nGet up out my face\nFeel me... Feel me\nBring another hundred bottles a day\nBartender please\nFeel me... Feel me\nLike fo real though\n\nAll this fraudulent shinin\nAnd imitation diamonds is damn near blinding\nEvery time leave the country\nI gotta come back foreign just to remind ya\nKnow they watchin my moves but they never figure out exactly how I'm grindin\nI needs rock to my ears\nThey say the bands look at the finest\nNo captains, funny\nFlashing this money like you taking something from me\nGirl gave me the eye, this dude's a dummy\nDon't play boy, I'll bag yo lil bunny\nChain around my neck made the night look sunny\nGame so cold, your crew knows it's runny\nL's in the building, you know that kid\n'Cause 100 for yo nose, baby blow that quick\n\nForget yo swag (Forget yo swag)\nFeel me... Feel me\nGot money, I don't care bout that\nI don't care about that\nFeel me... Feel me\nKeep them ordinary chicks away\nGet up out my face\nFeel me... Feel me\nBring another hundred bottles a day\nBartender please\nFeel me... Feel me\n\nHold and grow, dipped in what\nGet a grip then flip, grip the dick, Heathcliff\nThe giff, the gaff, the riff, the raff\nI'm slick with the bit when I pin it to\nI'm attracted swag or the crip Louie bags\nLa di da and my Adidas\nGet out for shizzey, just say you never pissey\nYou'll never as cool as me, cool, chill back\n\nForget yo swag (Forget yo swag)\nFeel me... Feel me\nGot money, I don't care bout that\nI don't care about that\nFeel me... Feel me\nKeep them ordinary chicks away\nGet up out my face\nFeel me... Feel me\nBring another hundred bottles a day\nBartender please\nFeel me... Feel me\n\nYea, this the same old script\nLL Jordan, white riders on tip\nProving every rapper in the game can't spit\nYou gon turn around and get yo forehead split\nFinish with the workout, I might blow the splif\nYoung girls talking bout \u2013 Hi, Mister Smith\nQuick baby, put the Maserati in 5th\nBrim on the 80 ave, lookin all stiff\nLL, boy where you been?\nWithout you in the game how the coach gon win?\nCall Snoop Dogg, it's time to go in\nTell my man Bootsy bring the big mouths in\nStep on the parkay, you know I'm gon win\nIt's tight balling, you can't defend\nIf money is stacked up, Cool's locked in\nYa'll get the message, I ain't gotta press send\n\nForget yo swag (Forget yo swag)\nFeel me... Feel me\nGot money, I don't care bout that\nI don't care about that\nFeel me... Feel me\nKeep them ordinary chicks away\nGet up out my face\nFeel me... Feel me\nBring another hundred bottles a day\nBartender please\nFeel me... Feel me\nLL Cool J\nGrab a big mouth and funk away\nLL Cool J\nGrab a big mouth and funk away\nLL Cool J\nForget yo swag\nForget yo swag\nYou ain't got no swag, hell no\nL, baby kill to the J\nThis is how we funk today\nSnoop Doggy Dogg, wuddup?\nWuddup Snoop?\nL, move yo ass\nStuck in that boys are now\nYo Big Bootsy, what's happenin baby?\nBall around the world, call big mouth girl\nHow old is them people?\nLJ, I'm ridin daily\nRide Sally, side\nUntil the smoke comes out yo thighs\nLL's back on the lot\nWhat else? Let it rock\nL, are you ready to rock?\nI'm ready\nLL, are you ready to rock?\nSnoop I'm ready\nLL's back on the lot\nReady to rock\nAre you ready?\nI'm ready, Bootsy\nYea\nStuck in that boys are now\nYou might need some gin & juice after this\n",
