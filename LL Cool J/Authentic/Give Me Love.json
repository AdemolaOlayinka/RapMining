What's the odds?\nThat's scary, what if I get hit that hard\nSo hard I can't get up, heart got lit up\nToo weak to move, can't eat, no sit up\nMommy used to say \u2013 don't worry, it's just a hiccup\nBut even she can't help\nWhen your heart's on fire, about to melt\nSo everything I really feel, I keep it to myself\nSo I don't end up hurt like everybody else\nTook love off the bat, burn I put it on the shelf\nWith the books I never read about pain I never felt\nLove is a problem, baby I need help\nMy card's on the table and my heart's breaking me up\n\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (I swear)\nUh baby\nGive me love\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\n\nGive it to me baby (you baby)\nGive it to me baby (from you baby)\nGive it to me baby (yea)\nGive it to me\nJust give me your heart\nGive it to me baby\nUh baby\nGive it to me baby\nUh girl\nGive it to me baby\nI swear all I need is your love\n\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\nWhen the last chapter's done, I hope your mine\nYea\n(I need you to know)\nIt was the best of times, it was the worst of times\nWhen the last chapter's done, I hope your mine\nBut until that try\n\nGive me love\nI swear all I need is your heart (that's all I need)\nUh baby (Uh baby)\nGive me love (oh love)\nTell me when you need me to stop\nI swear all I need is your love\nGive it to me baby (your love)\nGive it to me baby (just what I need)\nGive it to me baby (your love is just what I need)\nGive it to me baby\nGive it to me baby (your love, your love, your love)\nGive it to me baby\nGive it to me baby (that's what I need)\nAll I need is your love\nDear diary (dear diary)\nI hope she feels the same\nI hope she keeps loving me\nKeeps loving me as I'm loving\nI love er more than ever\nI pray our love won't change\nLet's go home\nGive me love\n",
