    "lyrics": "(Listen to this)\nYo Ren !\nWhassup ?\nTake (one)\nYo (Hit it)\n\n\nRuthless, plenty of that and much more\nSo at the party, Ren is controllin the floor\nthat you step and do your danceroutine\nIt ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene\nwith a villain doin damage on a 24 track\nWith confusion to finish my conclusion\nArhytomatic rhymes from a radio cat\nYou can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back\nCold killin\nYou wanna know what it's means ? (definition...villain)\nWith the stupid dope rhyme\nSo once you hear one line you can tell it's mine\nWith a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin\nand a look that keeps you all starin\nand wondering why I'm invincible\nBut when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible\nI don't take no shorts while I'm constructin the ground\nthat makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound\nGirls drool on me like a dyin\n(Yo Ren, tell'em what they do when you start rhymin)\nI go to the party. I hip a hop the spot\nI dunno what it is, but the girls get hot\naspirin like they're on fire and\ntheir so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin\nAnd for this reason I'm a walkin threath\nSo when I'm on stage I want...(Ssssht)\n\nQuiet on tha set\n(Light, camera, action)\nN.W.A. take (two)\n\n\nNow to get started with my musical profession\nA gangsta or villain in mine is in session\nThe way that I'm referrin to this makes ya move ya butt\nbut don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up\nAnyway I keep the clappin along\ncoz nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong\nwho could ask for anything more\nwhen N.W.A. is cold rockin the floor\nlike stupid, actin like a retard\nwaitin for a bumrush, gettin to the good part\nIt tips me so with temptation\nwritin my lyrics with this hyped information\nJust look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines\nIt's mine !\nUnpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed\nIt's irresistable, meanin that you can't avoid\nAnd while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat\nbut after I rip it up I want...(Ssssht)\n\nQuiet on tha set\n(Light, camera, action)\nN.W.A. take (three)\n\n\nI can be loud as hell, think I will ? (Never)\n(Ssssht)\n(Quiet on tha set)\nYeah I like that better\n(?? huh ?? As what I can do ??) I think I earn respect\nAnd if I didn't from you, that's what I expect\ncoz if it ain't ruff it ain't me\nSo who really cares how you want me to be\nSee, I'm just me standin at the top of the pile\nand doin soft known tunes it ain't my style\nAnd this concludes our program\nof how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam\nNow first we take an average drum\nGive it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb\nIt's no secret, that I sit alone at night\nPick up a pad and pen and begin to write\nall kinda lyrics that's promised to play\nto make everybody say:\n(They can be cold and ruthless no question about that,\nbut sometimes it's more complicated...)\nYo Dre (You know what I want you to do ?)\nBring that beat back, bring that beat back\n\nNow MC Ren is here workin like super glue\nNo matter what I do, I'm always thinkin o' you\nCoz I'm the pusher, supplyin the fix\nAnd this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix\nBut I'm makin obstacles of enemy traps\nto catch any MC's with the weak-ass raps\nCrucifyin their like just for usin my name\nThe definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\ncoz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme\nSo, you're in the back of me just listen and learn\nbecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my sideman wants to give a preview\nso at my next concert I wanna see you\nthere not sittin in a chair\nstandin on yo feet, with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to get out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect the more funkier track\ndeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nwith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe beat that I'm and you know that's bad\nNow continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set\n",
