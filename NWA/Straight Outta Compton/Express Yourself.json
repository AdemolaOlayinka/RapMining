There's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin\nBut scared to kick reality.\nMan, you've been doing all this dope producing.\nYou had a chance to show 'em what time it is...\nSo, what you want me to do?\nExpress Yourself...\n\nI'm expressin' with my full capabilities,\nAnd now I'm livin' in correctional facilities,\nCause some don't agree with how I do this.\nI get straight, meditate like a Buddhist\nI'm droppin' flava, my behaviour is heriditery,\nBut my technique is very necessary.\nBlame it on Ice Cube... Because he says it gets funky\nWhen you got a subject and a predacit.\nAdd it on a dope beat\nAnd that'll make you think.\nSome suckaz just tickle me pink\nTo my stomache. 'Cause they don't flow like this one.\nYou know what? I won't hesitate to dis one\nOr two before I'm through.\nSo don't try to sing this!\nSome drop science\nWhile I'm droppin' English.\nEven if Yella\nMakes it a-capella\nI still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or a sess.\nCause its known to give a brother brain damage.\nAnd brain damage on the mic don't manage\nNuthin'\nBut makin' a sucker and you equal.\nDon't be another sequel...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nNow, gettin' back to the PG.\nThat's program, and it's easy.\nDre is back. Newjacks, I mean hollow,\nExpressin' ain't their subject\nBecause they like to follow\nThe words, the style, the trend,\nThe records I spin.\nAgain and again and again\nYo, you on the other end.\nWhatch a brother playin' dope rhymes with no help.\nThere's no fessin' and guessin'\nWhile I'm expressin myself.\nIt's crazy to see people be\nWhat society wants them to be. But not me!\nRuthless...\nIs the way to go\nThey know.\nOthers say rhymes that fail\nTo be original.\nOr they kill where the hiphop starts,\nForget about the ghetto\nAnd rap for the pop charts.\nSome musicians curse at home\nBut scared to use profanity\nWhen up on the microphone.\nYeah, they want reality.\nBut you won't hear none.\nThey rather exaggerate, a little fiction.\nSome say no to drugs and take a stand,\nBut after the show they go lookin' for the dopeman.\nOr they ban my group from the radio.\nHear NWA and say \"Hell no! \".\nBut you know it ain't all about wealth.\nAs long as you make a note to...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nExpress Yourself...\nFrom the heart.\nCause if you wanna start to move up the chart\nThen expression is a big part of it.\nYou ain't efficient when you flow\nYou ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise.\nFull of rigor mortis.\nThere's a little bit more to show\nI got rhymes in my mind, and better like an embryo.\nOr a lesson - all of 'em expression\nAnd if you start fessin' -\nI got a Smith and Wessun\nFor you.\nI might ignore your record\nBecause it has no bottom.\nI get loose in the summer. When in spring and autumn\nIt's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical.\nDoin' the job\nNWA is the lynch mob!\nYes, I'm a cob?\nBut you know you need this.\nAnd the knowledge is growin'\nJust like a fetus, or a tumor.\nBut here's the rumor:\nDre is in the neighborhood\nAnd he's up to no good.\nWhen I start expressin' myself,\nYella, slam it!\nCause If I stay funky like this I'm doin' damage.\nOr I'm a be too hyped,\nAnd need a straight jacket.\nI got knowledge and other suckers lack it.\nSo, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic,\nAsk what it's like.\nIt's like we gettin' hype tonight.\nCause if I strike\nIt ain't for your good health.\nBut I won't strike if you just...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nExpress Yourself...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nExpress Yourself...\nCome on and do it...\nCome on and do it...\nCome on and do it...\nCome on and do it...\n",
