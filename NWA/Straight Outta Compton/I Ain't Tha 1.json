Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't\ndo nothin for me but get out of my face.)\n\n(I know what you mean girl, it ain't nothin right jumpin off\nunless he got dollars)\n\n\n\nSometimes I used to wonder\nHow the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number\nHe's gettin juiced for his ducats\nI tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket\nAnd won't think nuttin of it\nShe can ride or walk, either leave it or love it\nI show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say\nI'm a ruthless N-I double-G A\nCause I'm gamin on a female that's gamin on me\nYou know I spell girl with a B\nA brother like me is only out for one thing\nI think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no\nflowers to your doorstep, when we goin out\nCause you'll take it for granted, no doubt\nAnd after the date, I'ma want to do the wild thing\nYou want lobster huh? I'm thinking Burger King\nAnd when I take you, you get frustrated\nYou can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it\nBut you see, I don't go nuts\nOver girls like you with the BIG ol butts\nIt start comin out the pocket, to knock it\nBut when the damage is done...\nYou can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl\nFor the simple fact that, I ain't the one\n\n\n\n(I don't care how they look if they got money,\nwe can hook up but they ain't gettin none.)\n\n(Yeah I just make em think they gonna get some,\nplay up they mind a lil bit, and get that money.)\n\n(Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?)\n\n\n\nGive you money why bother\nCause you know I'm lookin nothin like your father\nGirl, I can't be played or ganked\nGanked means getting took for your bank\nOr your gold or your money or something\nNine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing\nThey get mad when I put it in perspective\nBut let's see if my knowledge is effective\nTo the brothas man they robbing you blind\nCause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind\nKeep your money to yourself homie\nand if you got enough game\nYou'll get her name and her number\nWithout going under\nYou can't leave em and love and stay above em\nI used to get no play now she stay behind me\nCause I said I had a Benz 190\nBut I lied and played the one\nJust to get some now she feels dumb\nTo my homies it's funny\nBut that's what you get trying to play me for my money\nNow don't you feel used\nBut I don't give hoot, huh, because I knock boots\nYou shouldn't be, so damn material\nAnd try to milk Ice Cube like cereal\nNow how many times do I have to say it\nCause if I have to go get a gun\nYou girls will learn I don't burn\nYou think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one\n\n\n\n(But you said you love me!)\nI don't see no rings on this finger\n(Why you doin me like this? I love you!)\nYeah you love my money, I got what I wanted - beat it\n",
