    "lyrics": "Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage\nSo whenever I'm steppin' cover your head like an ostrich\nGroupies been waitin' for this, suckers been hatin for this\nYou know why? Because so many are relatin' to this\nJealous is how they feel it intentionally\nBut they start to love it because I made it eventually\nPumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin'\nCause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'\nYo, you know the color, the villain's in black\nAlways down to make noise, and attack\nSo you better get back unless you wanna come with it\nAnd make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it\nYou're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin'\nYou're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and\nI'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts\nThat's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack\nSo brothers that wanna scrap with me\nThat sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me\nEspecially beggin' to write some lyrics with me\nI just snatch your girl to take a nap with me\nCause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison\nAnd if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'\nBut I understand cause you're mentally slow\nCause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't' ruff, it ain't me\n(The gangsta's black and he's about to attack)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\nLemme bust a freestyle there (Alright then)\nI can tell that you're afraid to fight me\nSimple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me\nBecause your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat\nI'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck\nAnd clean the dirt off your face that causes acne\nIt's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me\nThis is the round where the punch will go\nInto your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow\nI'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin\nLike, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'\nScared to speak with a thought when they're chosen\nThe sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen\nThis is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'\nAgainst a brother on a tip, with a Kangol\nGivin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin\nBut I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'\nWith the hype of a nine volt battery\nAnd the odds for me to conquer is averagely good\nMeanin' I'mma flow\nI'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me\n(Man whatcha gonna do now?) Get funky\nThe 'do not disturb' sign is in effect\nWhile I'm thinkin of a fool to select\nTo give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim\nSlammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them\nTell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer\nAnd get a new track o' drums so I can play with\nPercussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform\nYo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform\nIt ain't a rule in the book you have to go by\nHey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I\nFor fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear\nCoz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear\nThe Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super\nBut now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper\nBut a soldier with a top rankin\nGivin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'\nSo play like an airplane and just jet\nAnd keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, if not\nI'm afraid of the show\nThat you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\nIf it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)\n(The gangsta's black) If it ain't, if it ain't\n",
