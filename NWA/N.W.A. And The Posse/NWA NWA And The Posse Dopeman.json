Man, I can't believe this shit.\nThis bitch is tryin' to gank me!\nYo I ought to slap you up side your head with 9 inches of limp dick!\nYou need a nigga with money, so you get a dopeman.\nJuice that fool for as much as you can.\nShe likes his car and he gets with her.\nGot a black-eye 'cause the Dopeman hit her.\nLet that slide and you pay it no mind.\nFind that he's slapping you, all the time!\nBut that's okay 'cause he's so rich,\nAnd you ain't nothin' but a Dopeman's bitch.\nDo what he say and you keep your mouth shut.\nPoppin' that trash might get you fucked up.\nWe'll sit and cry if the Dopeman strikes you.\nHe don't give a fuck, he got 2 just like you.\nThere's a another girl in the Dopeman's life.\nNot quite a bitch but far from a wife.\nShe's called The Strawberry and everybody know\n\"Strawberry! Strawberry! Is the neighborhood hoe\".\nDo anything for a hit or two.\nGive the bitch a rock and she'll fuck the whole damn crew.\nIt might be your wife and it might make you sick.\nCome home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick.\nStrawberry, just look you'll see her.\nBut don't fuck around, she'll give you gonorrhea.\nIf people out there not hip to the fact\nStrawberry is a girl selling pussy for crack to the...\nDopeman!

Cocaine? This shit's insane.\nYo, E, she's a berry, let's run a train!\nMan, I wouldn't touch that bitch!\nMe neither, hoe go home and wash out ya beaver.\nAnd nigga's are out there, messing up people's health,\nYo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself?\nWell, I'm the Dopeman, yeah, boy wear corduroy.\nMoney up to here but unemployed.\nYou keep smoking that rock,\nAnd my pocket's getting bigger.\nYo, got that 5-0, double-up nigga!\nYeah, high rollin', big money, I'm foldin\nBitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'.\nStrong strawberry, jockin' me so early.\nHoe, ya wanna hit?
