N.W.A. And The Posse
1987)
(Fat girl!)
(You're a fat girl)
(Fat...fat...fat fat fat fat girl) 

(It's funky fresh Eazy E) new kid on tha block
And already got a fat girl on my jock
Now my story's kinda simple, so please take it simple
As I tell you a tale bout this big fat pimple
I was chillin on the ave, drinkin some booze
Saw a fatty comin my way, so what was I to do?
I busted a U, went tha other way again
but forgot that tha Avenue was a dead end
I turned around, here she came, stride for stride
funky fat like that, bout two thirty-five
Stampede was rushin, I double looked
and she had more chins than a chinese phonebook
Five four three ugly as can be, she said 

 
Hello Eazy E. Do you remember me? (I said no)
Huhu yes you do suga
My name is Bertha but you can call me booga
Remember the time when you were drunk at a party
We was slow dancin, give ya all this body


When she said that she loved me, I was in shock
Oh my God got a fat girl on my jock


(I got a fat girl on my jock) (Fat girl) (Got a fat girl on my jock)

She gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown
and with a bare hug picked me off tha ground
Squeezion me tight, atttempted to bug me
Grabbed me by tha rear, said (Love me, hug me!)
I was hell, victim of a scandal
coz this girl's too much for E to handle
Broke tha bee's grip, started to run
Back to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun
She's grubbin, thighs rubbin in a hot pursuit
I loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot
She kept on comin because of addiction
Legs on fire because of friction
My gun broke, now I was doomed
Dropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon
As I swung, tha fat girl fell
Lyin on tha ave just like a beach whale
That's tha story, it's quite ill
and all fat girls y'all besta chill
All overweight freaks stay off my block
Cause it's eerie to have a fat girl on your jock
