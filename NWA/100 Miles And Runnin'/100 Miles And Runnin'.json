Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.\nSo for now pack the gun and\nHold it in the air.\n'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...\n\n\"Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.\"\n\"FBI sources tell us that the four are headed\"\n\"100 miles to their homebase, Compton.\"\n\n\nLend me a mutherfuckin' ear.\nSo I can tell you why...\n\n\nRunnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase.\nWith a steady pace on the face that just we raced.\nThe road ahead goes on and on.\nThe shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon.\nRunnin' on but never runnin' out.\nStayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.\nHitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.\nBut nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude.\nConfused...\nYo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose.\nOne of the few who's been accused and abused\nOf the crime of poisonin' young minds.\nBut you don't know shit til you been in my shoes.\nAnd Dre is back from the C-P-T.\nDroppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.\nSo fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!\nAnd any mutherfucker that disagrees.\nStuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.\n'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.\nMy mind was slick - my temper was too quick.\nNow the FBI's all over my dick.\n\n\nGot us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.\nThat's when the E jumped off the startin' block.\nA 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch.\nA little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch.\nYeah, back to Compton again.\nYo, it's either that or the Federal pen.\n'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.\nTakin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind.\nRunnin' like I just don't care.\nCompton's 50 miles but , yo, I'mma get there.\nArchin' my back and on a straight rough.\nJust like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out.\nFrom city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.\nRippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm\nA straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'\nStraight at yo ass.\nA 100 Miles and Runnin'...\n\n\n\nThis one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.\nYou're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:\n\"Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide.\"\nGood luck brothers.\n\n\nRunnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.\nShow me on the news but I hate to be abused.\nI know it was a set-up.\nSo now I'm gonna get up.\nEven if the FBI wants me to shut up.\nBut I've got 10 000 niggas strong.\nThey got everybody singin' my \"Fuck Tha Police\" song.\nAnd while they treat my group like dirt,\nTheir whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.\nSo I'mma run til I can't run no more.\n'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score.\nI got a urge to kick down doors.\nAt my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.\n\n\nClouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.\nDick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'.\nStarted with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.\nSo now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.\nThe number's even - now I'm leavin'.\nWe're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.\nHer and the troops are right behind me.\nBut they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.\n\n\nOne more mile to go through the dark streets.\nRunnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet.\nBut you know I never stumble or lag last.\nI'm almost home so I better haul ass.\nTearin' up everything in sight.\nIt's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight.\nNow that chase, the shit, is done and\nFour mutherfuckers goin' crazy with\nA 100 Miles of Runnin'!\n\n\n\nStop! Stop! Stop! Stop!\nSurprise, niggas\n",
