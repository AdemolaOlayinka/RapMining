Aight, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight, aight
I'm aight if you aight, I'm aight
I be better, get some of that bass
Word
You know what I'm sayin'
Give it up
Aight, yeah
Booty twinkin' body shakin'
Nuffattackin', brain's a rackin'
Clock tockin', chuck shockin'
Flavor flavor, ain't never shavin'
One, two, three, four
It's another record, check it, mad methods
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin' up to the devil, steppin' down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts, fuck the fourty ounce
I sued them bastards, yeah, they got bounce
I did 'em like a demo, threw 'em out the window
I took a 98 'cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pu-pump pump it up
A mad rhyme for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got 'em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin' back your brain
Wreckin' records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough? Yeah, you got ta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up yeah
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Come again with the same old bounce
I'm calling a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense, mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's wack
And once again it's on!
Hey, Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin', "I don't care", it's on
I'm comin' with a rhyme, what? I'm lettin' go a rhyme, yeah!
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
You call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher
When I'm takin' his sound to bring you down
Rappers rippin' a lyrical kickin' finger-lickin'
But to the rhythm I'm givin' but never cotton pickin'
Like James Brown I'm sayin' it loud
Am I loud enough? Huh, you got ta give it up
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never, ever change
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
And when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know like Run said, "So here we go"
Where it is inside, whoop, there it is
There it is, there it is, damn right
My man X is a bad mother, shut your mouth
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man
There it is, can you hit me off with another one
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
I never did represent doing dumb shit
Some gangsta lying, I'd rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing 'em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing 'em
Flick 'em, and I fling 'em, you can go with 'em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing 'em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time to prevent some crime
And who behind puttin' the guns to the young ones
The ones that make 'em is the ones that take 'em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check yaself before ya wreck yaself
Respect yaself, hah, you got ta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up
