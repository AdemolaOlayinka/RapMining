God damn\nIf it comes down to shuttin\nThem down\nI'm in the hood surrounded\nTell em I'm grounded\nI'm on that psycho analytical\nTip if politics iz stickin to\nThe mix\nLike tricks\nI'm one more time givin time\nWhere the rhyme go\nElite to the street\nTo the brothas doin death row\nSo where ya at\nIf the beat ain't fat\nSay what\nC'mon\nAnd get some\nRattle rattle\nKiss and I hum\nCome can you\nGet it on the one\nC'mon pick it up\npick it at\npack it at\npack it up\nTo the black\nWho be talkin\nWhere they at\nWhere they at\nWicked wild\nFeelin irie\nNot sorry\nGet it see it written down in a diary\nSame say fuck all dat\nPolitical shit\nBut wanna get paid when\nTheir brains in the second grade\nNowhere to run/here they come come\nNowhere to run/here they come come\nI'm a fan first\nI reverse another trick verse\nTo the point\nWhere I can rock dis funky joint\nIn the brain game, I'm keepin my head clear\nIn 33 years so what\nI never had a beer\nI don't know what I'm missin\nI'm not dissin\nBut I know I ain't ass kissin\nTime to draw the line\nThis time the rhyme\nGot da good guy goin gettin da nine\nCause I know the hoody\nGot it good wit the hitman\nCan I get a hitman\nKnow I'm duckin nat quicksand\nThe funky automatic\nHandlin static\nSellin out I ain't good at it\n& when I got bumbed\nI'm gonna open up\nHitt em up stone to da bone\nBut it ain't gotta be like that\nAnd thats that\nCan u tell me yall...what\nAll in wit the law\nThey fall in\nThe great white hole where they\nBe sellin their soul\nNever get enough\nThey be talkin dat roughneck shit\nBe comin they quit\nFuck dat blood iz ticker\nThan water shit\nThat shit iz counterfeit\nDevil go where da shoe fit\nBlack mans law iz raw like Africa\nYou violate\nWere comin after ya\nThey're here\n",
