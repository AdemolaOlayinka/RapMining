Bunch of crash test dummy's\nIf all this shit, means the end of my money,\nThis is a stick up, off go the pagers and celly's\nUs dollar, ain't worth what it's printed on,\nBacked by the pentagon, sounds like babylon,\nSo I babble on, some of us stuck\nIn them barbershops and them hair salons,\nWhile the crash comin at your ass...\nWhile the crash comin at your ass like a bomb.\nNow it all comes tumblin, runnin\nTime is runnin runnin crash is coming,\nBreak the bank, spinning since the beginning,\nNow it all comes tumblin, crumblin\nTime is runnin runnin crash is coming,\nBreak the bank, spinning since the beginning,\nWillie dynamite, time to cry and no ice.\nY2k, fallin out of the sky, so its chosen\nYour ice is frozen, don't cry dry your eye\nAin't this a bitch, fuckin glitch. Mother fucker what\nThe count down to my account, count it down\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust, hush make that head bust.\nLast hour no control tower\nMaking new may flowers, fightin new powers\nHave you forgotten, the other side of rotten,\nPicking electronic cotton diggin digital ditches,\nLookout, lookout for the crash...crash...crash..\nHave you forgotten, have yor forgotten\nY2k, that's the question,\nWhat the fuck is up got the 85 guessin,\nI told y'all for y'all protection\nGot me a name change, a pair of smith an wessuns\nStarring crescents mad packed with the lessons,\nFigure 5% got the 10 counting blessings\nProgrammed by programs got you bowingto the man.\nAvoid collisions in mid-air, medicaid and welfare\nZero zero what the fuck do you care?\nAll the lights be out, you can't get nowhere.\nAll around, that's why I found tony brown\nThe world we know, it's going down...down...down...down\n",
