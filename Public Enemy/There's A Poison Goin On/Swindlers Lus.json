(GEYEAH!)\nFrom the back of the bus, neither one of us\ncontrol the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust\nHickory dickory dock\nHand in my pocket, rob me for my chocolate (eheheheh)\nMo' dollars, mo' cents, for the Big Six\nAnother million led to bled, claimin innocence\nIs it any wonder why black folks goin under --\n-- cause niggaz be sold in bundles\nNo pressure, tell me why they don't care\nRap and R&B pavin the streets of Bel-Air\nFrom the sales of singers, no longer here\nThe bigger killer, get the bigger share (eheheheh)\nNow the ones I attack, negroes got their back\nNo, eighty/twenty is a wack contract\nForever lack, the voice of real blacks\nStole rock'n'roll and ain't gave it back (yea yea)\nStarted off my defense, now they're the ones I defend against\nwho fell up into the tricks\n\"Fuck the Fight the Power shit; get that Chuck D nigga fixed,\nand keep him up out of the mix\"\nWell hell, tell em Chuck don't suck no dick\nBe an ass, and that ass get kicked\nHand in my pocket, rob me for my chocolate\nWatch em swindle yo' ass and turn a profit\nIf you don't own the master, then the master own you\nWho you trust, from Swindler's Lust?\nFrom the back of the bus, neither one of us\ncontrol the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust\nThey don't care about me, they don't care about you\nThey don't care about you and your crew\nyour family neighborhood and plus, heh,\nthey don't give a damn about us\nOne thing about them, they like to exploit though\nVultures of culture\nThey like to exploit little suckers\nA dollar a rhyme -- while we barely get a dime\n\nProfit off the soul of black folk\nTurn em into bitches, niggaz, and stupid ass jokes\nLaugh with us? Or laughin at us? That's what I'm guessin\nWe in the Rutgers program with that question\nThey came in and sat at the feet (uh-huh) of our ancient ancestors; they learned (yeah) they took it back.\nThey came back, then they imitated (right)\nOnce they got enough, they came back and destroyed\n\nLaughin all the way to the bank; remember them own the banks\nand them god damn tanks (god damn right)\nNow what company do I thank? Ain't this a bitch\nHeard they owned slaves, in a ship that sank\n\nAight aight aight aight yo yo\nWhere all the Louie's? Where my Louie's? Ehehe\n\nIf you don't own the master, then the master own you\nWho you trust, from Swindler's Lust?\nFrom the back of the bus, neither one of us control the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust\nThis to the blues people in the Delta\nThis for everybody in the 50's that didn't, get their money\nLittle Richard gettin half of a penny\nAll of the super soul singers of the 60's\nAll the bands of the 70's on the outside lookin in\nAll the people that didn't make a DIME\noff their session playin\nAnd even the rappers in the 80's and 90's\nstill tryin to get paid, from what they put in, yeah\nIf you don't own the master, then the master own you\nWho you trust, from Swindler's Lust?\nFrom the back of the bus, neither one of us\ncontrol the fate of our soul, in Swindler's Lust\nHmm..\n",
