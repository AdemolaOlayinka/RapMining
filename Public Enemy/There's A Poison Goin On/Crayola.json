What am I\nAnother number and a ho, they don't know\nTime to see em go like dominoes\nAbout time cause they endorsed the crime up in the rhyme\nGot these new souls controlled goin outta their mind\nMissed what I said cause they don't even own their own heads\nGo one go all I forgot they made robots outta some of yall\nToday all fucked up ways must fall\nToday is up against the wall\nMisled in the head fucked by quiet storms and love songs\nNoddin heads too hollow forgotten tomorrow\nSwallowing all that shit that's shallow\nGive the baby anything the baby wants\nBut that's how them bastards get us up in them caskets\nTry to get me where they want me\nBefore some of them jump me\nGo tell em I'm a start a rebellion\nEducate the felons easy on yeah\nTell em what the fuck am I yellin\nNo tellin you got them artists and artificials\nIf it ain't right I don't give a damn if it's sellin\nRecruits chasin and racin for that loot\nUsin usual drum loops so I salute my troops\nI don't socialize or mingle, fuck the promotionals\nAnd you know what and that g-damn single\nAnd the marketing team for that matter\nIt don't matter\nDj's gettin dimes for time on a platter\nI ain't gotta be high to jack so I hijack\nFm - radio - eff em turn it around muthafucka\nGods to niggas, queens to bitches\nRace against time see em all runnin for the riches\nEverything had its chance last dance\nSome things change like them weather forecasts\nHa funny how shit don't last\nCrayola with that same same ol shit\nCrayola with that played playa shit\nCrayola with that kid crayon shit\nCrayola with them ol spray on hits\n",
