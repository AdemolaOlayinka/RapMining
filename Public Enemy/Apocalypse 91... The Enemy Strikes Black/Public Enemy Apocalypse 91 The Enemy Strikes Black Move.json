Green\nThey slapped the mack\nThat kept us back\nSucker suckin' the hood like drack\nSo if ya draggin' us down\nWit' the wack attitude\nGet up, lookout, get out the way\nMove\nSigned\nSealed\nDefinition of a set-up\nPourin' it on and won't let up\n'Cause f-a-l-l-i-n\nNever applied\nTo this brother that tried\nTo let ya know\nThe folk of the American joke\nThat kept us broke\nNow I'm ready to rap\nStrong fax I swing\nLike Bo Jax\nI'm never calm on a bomb track\n60 percent 3/fifths\nConstituted\nHuh prostituted\nWhy I'm mad\n'Cause it's written on the paper\nRight now\nMuther Fuck bow\nKicked\nThe\nLyric\nAbout\nThe tricks\nOf the trade and the money made\nWho got the money betcha bottom\nDollar bill\nGonna find\nSome rich ol' bloodline\nBut the blood is in the mud\nTake the whack an attack it\nLike a Skud\nTo the patriotic hater\nThat got paid off my people\nI'm rude\nLookout, get out the way\nMOVE\nSigned\nAn what I'm gettin' is mine\nI bring the noise\nTo town\nSo let's get down\nI cranked the beats\nTearin' up the street\nAnd the park\nAn it ain't Mozart\nJack movin' out\n'Cause the black movin' in\nAnd its old\nI said it in\nWho Stole The Soul?\nbut 92 bring\nAn attitude\nThat say I don't give a\nFuck\nAbout the old way\nThis is a new day\nTell Jack stay in the back\nAnd all the other\nSuckers\nThat don't matter\nYou got\nSomethin' to prove\nScatter\nGet out the way\nMOVE!\n",
