    "lyrics": "Welcome home to the terrordome\nLand of the forbidden\nCause that man be sinnen\nAnd his hand be hidden\nTo rule the planet\nHe planned from the beginnin\nSuperegoman sounds like lucifer is winnin\nYo he wanna buck us\nSo im stoppin all that ruckus\nYall dont know the d in my name\nIs like fredrick as in douglas\nAnother body\nCause the feds crashed the party\nYou confuse your own folk\nRunning from the paparazzi\nDirty mind and tap water\nConsumin yo body\nIlluminati in the tomb\nPoisonin the womb\nCant be a guinea pig\nWith the glock to the wig\n10 years since we lost pac and big\nDont get it twisted dont get it confused\nThe term snitch\nRevolutionaries use\nWhen the government got the hood rhymin the blues\nThats the term when the whole town lose\n\nSee something you better say something\nCause saving something aint worth sayin nothing\n\n\n\nGenocide on us where\nThey practice this\nThats why i pack the fifth\nSee how wack this is\nThey ready the clips\nReplaced the whips\nNot cars im tallkin bout them things that cause scars\nNight and days i know i still fight the power\nI know we came a different way than the mayflower\nAll them players rentin rims and hummers\nGot taught by a teacher defending columbus\nNew thug robbin ids and pin numbers\nSpot on my block\nBe hotter than 10 summers\nStuck in last century like a fax machine\nLeft back from the future\nLike some vaccine\nFrom ghana, botswana to watts and queens\nIs the tv killing black teens\nAnd their dreams?\nDont get it twisted dont get it confused\nThe term snitch\nRevolutionaries use\nWhen the government got the hood rhymin the blues\nThats the term when the whole town lose\n\nSee something you better say something\nCause saving something aint worth sayin nothing\n\n\n\nWhile some pass the criss\nThey happen to miss\nThe unexpected revolution\nFrom some young catalyst\nUntouchable on the fbi list\nNot know knowin these facts is more hazardous\nI rock intense\nKnock your block wit sense\nWelfare cut from them documents\nMasses volunteering for them chips\nTrace the hiv lane up that blood vessel\nIrs in that chest\nYou gotta wrestle\nLife is not a game\nNew war apocalyptic\nSee the wicked run and try to hide the statistic\nAint nuttin changed\nPe be the same crew\nIt aint a game\nOnce again gonna save you\nDont get it twisted dont get it confused\nThe term snitch\nRevolutionaries use\nWhen the government got the hood rhymin the blues\nThats the term when the whole town lose\n\nSee something you better say something\nCause saving something aint worth sayin nothing\n",
