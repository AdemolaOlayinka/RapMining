Police, never around\nThe respect, the intellect, and the suspect all out of town\nIt's all out of bounds. KRS, Chuck D makin our rounds, man\nWhile they takin us down, man\nWe're takin you down. I got another new sound\nIt's really an old sound, but you know how me and Chuck get down\nWe got peace, love, unity, and having the fun\nBut you all want sex, drugs, violence 101\nHere it is... Bam\nStop being a little boy with a little toy, stand up and be a man\nNow you see the plan, from west to east\nInstead of sex, drugs, and violence we got love, purpose, and peace\nWe be hurtin the least. We be workin, no seats\nBringing it to America like Geronimo and Cochise\nGet that, but make sure when you spit rap\nIf you ain't really ready to die, yo, don't spit that!\n\n\nWe like those gangsta rhymes...\nJust make sure they don't corrupt our minds...\nThese rappers kill and thief...\nA lot of times it's only make believe...\n\n\nOnce upon a time I was on Long Island\nA man got shot and he wasn't smilin\nHe was bleedin from his guts, yo\nA policeman was sittin and he drove up on the spot, yo\nNow when police light came on\nWhen the man died, who was the blame on?\nWasn't me. Not you\nI didn't kill nobody cuz my records don't do that\nI make the records for the kids\nGangsta rap flippin people's kid's lids\n\n\nWe like those gangsta rhymes...\nJust make sure they don't corrupt our minds...\nThese rappers kill and thief...\nA lot of times it's only make believe...\n",
