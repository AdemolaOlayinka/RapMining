This is Chuck D
And this is Flavor Flav
And Public Enemy is lettin' y'all know about black history month
February is Black History Month
But we'd like to say that every single month
We should recognise the rich culture
And heritage of black people
Although the battles have not been won yet
We should be proud to take some time out this month
To explore the powerful and victorious lineage of our people
That's right so don't be a vulture
And learn your culture
PE salutes the history of black people
And the history that we are yet to make
That's right, not a mistake
