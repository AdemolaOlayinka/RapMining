How low can you go?\nDeath row, what a brother know\nOnce again, back is the incredible\nrhyme animal, the incredible\nD, Public Enemy number one\n\"Five-O\" said, \"Freeze!\" and I got numb\nCan I tell 'em that I really never had a gun?\nBut it's the wax that the Terminator X spun\nNow they got me in a cell\n'Cause my records, they sell\n'Cause a brother like me said, Well\nFarrakhan's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to\nWhat he can say to you\" What you ought to do\nIs follow for now, power of the people, say,\n\"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical\"\nBlack is back, all in, We're gonna win\nCheck it out\n\nYeah, y'all, c'mon\n\nHere we go again\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\nHey yo, Chuck, they're sayin' we too black, man\nYo, I don't understand what they're saying\nBut little do they know they can get a smack for that, man\n\nNever badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad\nAt the fact that's corrupt like a senator\nSoul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope\n'Cause the beats in the lines are so dope\nListen for lessons I'm saying inside music\nThat the critics are all blasting me for\nThey'll never care for the brothers and sisters\nNow across the country has us up for the war\nWe got to demonstrate, come on now\nThey're gonna have to wait 'til we get it right\nRadio stations, I question their blackness\nThey call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\nHey yo, Chuck, they're illin', we chillin'\nYo, PE in the house, top billing\nYo, Chuck, show 'em what you can do, boy\n\nGet from in front of me, the crowd runs to me\nMy DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, y'know\nHe can cut a record from side to side\nSo what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide\nSoul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll\nMusic for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man\nMakin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, y'know\nYou call 'em demos\n\nBut we ride limos, too\n\nWhatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you\nBeat is for Sonny Bono\n\nBeat is for Yoko Ono\n\nRun-DMC first said a DJ could be a band\nStand on its own feet, get you out your seat\nBeat is for Eric B. and LL, as well, hell\nWax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells\nEver forever, universal, it will sell\nTime for me to exit, Terminator X it\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\nTurn it up! Bring the noise!\n\nYo, they should know by now that they can't stop this\nWord up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down\nBut yo, Flavor Flav ain't going out like that\nCome on\nCome on\nCome on, now\nCome on\n\nFrom coast to coast, so used to being like a comatose\nStand, my man, the beat's the same with a boast toast\nRock with some pizzazz, it will last. Why you ask?\nRoll with the rock stars, still never get accepted as\nWe got to plead the Fifth, you can investigate\nDon't need to wait, get the record straight\nHey, posse in effect, got Flavor, Terminator\nX to sign checks, play to get paid\nYou got to check it out down on the avenue\nA magazine or two is dissing me and dissing you\nYeah, I'm telling you...\n\nHey yo, Griff, the S1W\nWe got to handle this\nWe ain't goin' out like that\nYo man, straight up on the Columbo tip\nWe can do this, like Brutus\n'Cause we always knew this\nYou know what I'm sayin'\nThere's just one thing that puzzles me, my brother\nWhat's wrong with all these people around here, man...\n",
