Bomb drop designed as 
A warning shot 
Listen
Cause some of us don't check statistics
Kick it
40or so so million blacks in america
How can 13.5% of the population be scaring ya
88% of us cites are black 
95% of americas suburbs are white
But 10% of blacks are 50% white
But post racial politics 
Tricks and lessens the fight
Education economics enforcement of law
The gaps the ratio even 
Worse than before obama baby
The truth is america 
Will show you the door, 
Survey says
Run till its dark 
Truth hurts
Makes me curse in this fight the power church
Stole history from everybody
Sellin lies at the tea party
Shame 
Survey says peeps fed up with the feds
40 acres to 40 yards to 40 feet
Might as well be sleep 
Down laid out 6 feet....
Deep respect
Not yet
You gotta give it to get
Survey says
You gotta learn to earn way beyond your check
Lovable as huggin a bull
Thats some bull
Niggativity
Gotta lotta pull
Whats the use
If you tie the noose
And love the abuse?
Hanging yourself while you loving the loot
DJ lord knock it
Outta the park
Survey says
Run till its dark
