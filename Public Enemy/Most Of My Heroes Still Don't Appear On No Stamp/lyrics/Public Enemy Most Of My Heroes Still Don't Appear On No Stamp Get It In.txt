Public Enemy
Most Of My Heroes Still Don't Appear On No Stamp
2012)
My pens the ride 
On the pad the road
Yall must've known 
This is the way
I unwind and unload
Over beats overload
Mind explodes
Stress in this depression
New ghosts of tom joad
New dust bowl blues
Back to fake jewels
So I drop jewels
To inform the fooled
Clock tickin 3 songs a day
Like its food
Carry on
I am that ramblin man dude
Updated
I was born 
To deliver car songs
D still drives a caddy
I'll mess with a ford
Now songs are blood
And songs are swords
Everybody should be able to afford
Home food and a job to work
We the people gettin robbed by these corporate jerks
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the people hitch hiking the turnpike
Yall know that ain't right
So I gotta get it in tonight
Gotta
Get it in tonight

Bump knucks in the house 
And I came to (get it in) 
Rock rock with the best of the best

I always wanted to be an s1
March my dance steps and carry two guns
Cause I a rider for the strong island
Wilin stylin 98 crew retirin salute
For the culture ill shoot
Ha, boom bap at you

We prohibit wack rappers to move 
Ha, or we'll stomp on you
Throw your hands up five fingers
Close your fist
Then repeat after me and it goes like this
Cmon (get it in) word the rhymes are sick

Sloppy right jaw
