    "lyrics": "I occupy this state of mind\nLike I'm born a second time\nThe masses ask the question why\nThem asses spend a life behind\nOn the mic the pic\nAgainst this prison industry\nWhere most of them look just like me\nMf'-k the tea party\nMade you pay for education\nGot no money got you waitin\nTricks to keep the people fooled\nSomething in the food my dude\nAbout your future where you rank\nWho you think and who you thank\nBehind the banks and all them tanks\nNew whirl odor on the brink\nRevolution stop the feds\nCount the homeless under fed\nSue the pharmaceutical off the meds\nLeavin people left for dead\nLook back 80 years instead\nSimply blamed it on the reds\nPay close attention to what is said\nBut while you listen watch your heads.\nYou chase the money you chase the fame\nThe human race is what they're playing\nA game of life is what I'm sayin\nSplit em up call them names\nAt the age I am if I can't teach\nI shouldn't open my mouth to speak\nTalking loud and sayin nothing\nAnd frontin like they doin something\nFeel the people\nHeal the people\nPower goes out\nTo the people\n18-35 is grown\nCant afford to leave the home\nCan't afford to buy a home\nCan't afford to keep a home\nBoarded up foreclosed cribs\nBased on whatcha bank did\nYet see these guys advertise to the poor for clothes\nThe doors are closed\nThey slam the doors on your nose\nWho the hell is telling you\nWhat the hell they selling you\nWhy the hell do you believe\nWhere we headed when we leave\nWTF?\nWTF?\nWTF?\n\nFrom barack obama to flavor flav\nWe both be a first till we get to our grave\nI'm the first hype man in music\nHe's the first black president\nHe's the first black resident\nTo be ever come president\nFree your mind your ass will follow\nFlavor flav all the way to the apollo\nFreeport li to la\nThrow a frito olay off the dock of the bay\nYou wanna know why a kid goes to school?\nAnd in his book-bag he carries a tool\nBecause hes trying to be like his idols in the streets\nGang warfare to the raw fare\nDon't even try to go up there\nPenalties that you cant bear\nYou lose your sight your ass cant hear\nIt weighs so much it'll crush your life\nDon't play with god he gave you live\nThe last man standing he hopes to behold\nHis weight in stature his weight in gold\nWhat goes in your wash comes out in your rinse\nBack down so tight that you call it condensed\nCant stand the pressure, cant stand the pain\nMy life is so dry I wish it would rain\nJust like the temptations not just the singing group\nI'm here to tell you now so don't ignore the scoop\nI been in this rap game for 25 years\nIf we made the rock and roll hall of fame\nWe deserve our chairs\nTo what we fought the power to who stole the soul\nBrothers gonna work it out\nFrom the ground we hold\nGod says to man ima let you live\nGod says to man ima let you live\nGod says to man ima give you power\nNot for the intent to misuse your power\nIf you wanna dance you got to play the bands\nPeople die by other hands\nThe innocent, the ku klux klan\nIraq and iran an afhganistan\nThey go to war they don't come back\nThe note comes home killed in attack\nAll the medals from fort bragg\nCollected by a widow along with the flag\n41 gun salute 4 jets in the air\nNow thats going out of style the\nContribution was fear\nWhat you reap is what you sow\nA man got killed for what he know\nIf you wanna be a -- and get a good wife\nStay the fuck offa skype and don't believe the hype\nWTF?\nWTF?\nWTF?\n",
