Which means rearrange shit,\nErase shit, stuck on Playstations.\nThen the new plantations, I said a millions heads.\nWaitin for another nation.\nTo make your world be free.\nNo shoppin sprees, there ain't no stoppin me.\nHere's the fee, not the weed.\nGot to see, God speed. What you need is...\n\nSticky D gives you fits, on them turnaround hippocrytes.\nComin and goin like flics.\nHit em net scripts, like a butcher.\nGettin all the chips musta been a road trip against the Knicks.\nOn T.V. showcasin kicks.\nMust be the fan cause his video gettin all the chicks.\nWalk up on a replay on Monday.\nSportscenter highlights, last second steal kept em real.\nWhat you need is...\nJesus\nJesus (What you need is)\nJesus\nJesus (What you need is)\nJesus\nJesus (What you need is)\nJesus\nJesus\n",
