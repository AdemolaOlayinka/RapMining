    "lyrics": "Ooh Chuck, they outta get us man\nYo, we gotta dust these boys off\nIn this corner with the 98\nSubject of suckers - object of hate\nWho's the one some think is great\nI'm that one - son of a gun\nDrivin' by - wavin' my fist\nMakin' 'em mad when I'm goin' like this\nTop gun - never on the run\nThey know not to come cause they all get some\nGoin' quicker in the speedin' lane\nJealous can't do it and it's causin' them pain\nCaught in my smoke - all they did was choke\nLook at my spokes - you know I'm no joke\nOut that window - middle finger for all\nJealous at my ride, stereo and blackwalls\nSuckers they got the nerve and gall\nTo talk 'bout the car when they're walkin' tall\n\nSuckers to tha side\nI know you hate my 98\nYou gonna get yours\nPullin' away - every day\nLeavin' you in the dust\nSo you know I get paid - on the mile ego trip\nAnd 5-o tailin' on my tip\nWatch me burn rubber - fall in my flame\nThis episode is always the same\nSeein' no comp comin' like I'm blind\nAll left back - trailin' my behind\nI go faster cops try to shoot me\nThey'll get theirs when they try to get me\nI'll let it go - my turbo\nRun, I'm in the river cause they're movin' too slow\nLaughin' hard at their attempt\nSo what if the judge charged me contempt\nI'd rub my boomerang - 'cause I'm feelin' proud\nAnd I wouldn't even hear them cause my radio's loud\n\nCruisin' down the boulevard\nI treated like some superstar\nYou know the time so don't look hard\nGet with it - the ultimate homeboy car\nAll you suckers in the other ride\nWherever I'm comin' get you my side\nMy 98 is tough to chase\nIf you're on my tail - better watch your face\nSmoke is comin' when I burn\nRubber when my wheels turn\nA tinted window - so super bad\nLookin' like the car the Green Hornet had\nIt's the reason I'm ahead of the pack\nIt's the reason I left them back\nIt's the reason all the people say\nMy 98-O blows 'em all away\nMy 98 Oldsmobile is...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile's so...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile is...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile's like...\n\nUnderstand - I don't drive drunk\nMy 98's fly - I don't drive no junk\nNo cop gotta a right to call me a punk\nTake this ticket - go to hell and stick it\nPut me on a kick butt - line up, times up\nThis government needs a tune up\nI don't know what's happenin' - what's up\nGun in my chest - I'm under arrest\nSidewalk suckers wanted to spill me\nSo I got my crew and posse\nTook their girls and got them to thrill me\nStepped outside - got in my ride\nDrove them around an' I looked around town\nCaught 'em out there cold - ran 'em over and down\nThey didn't get me and that's the truth\nCause the 98-O is bullet proof\nMy 98 Oldsmobile's so...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile is...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile's so...\nMy 98 Oldsmobile's like...\n",
