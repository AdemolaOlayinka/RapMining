    "lyrics": "Yo Chuck, bust a move man\nI was on my way up here to the studio\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nAnd this brother stop me and axe me\n\"Yo wassup with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice\"\nI said\n\"Yo the brother don't swear he's nice, he knows he's nice\"\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nSo Chuck, we gotta fill in\nYou turn him into a Public Enemy man\nNow remeber that line you was kicking to me\nOn the way out to LA\nWhile we was in the car on our way to the Shot\nWell yo right now kick the bass for them brothers\nAnd let them know\nWhat goes on\nWhat goes on\nWell I'm all in - put it up on the board\nAnother rapper shot down from the mouth that roared\n1-2-3 down for the count\nThe result of my lyrics - oh yes, no doubt\nCold rock rap - 49er supreme\nIs what I choose and I use - I never lose to a team\nCause I can can go solo - like a Tyson bolo\nMake the fly girls wanna have my photo\nRun in their room - hang it on the wall\nIn remembrance that I rocked them all\nSuckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees\nYou can't rock the kid - so go cut the cheese\nTake this application of rhymes like these\nMy rap's red hot - 110 degrees\nSo don't start bassin' I'll start placin'\nBets on that you'll be disgracing\nYou and your mind from a beatin' from my rhymes\nA time for a crime that I can't find\nI'll show you my gun - my Uzi weighs a ton\nBecause I'm Public Enemy number one\nOne\nYou got no rap - but you want to battle\nIt's like havin' a boat - but you got no paddle\nCause I never pause - I say it because\nI don't break in stores - but I break all laws\nWritten while sittin' - all fittin' not bitten\nGivin' me the juice that your not gettin'\nI'm not a law obeyer - so you can tell your mayor\nI'm a non-stop, rhythm rock poetry sayer\nI'm the rhyme player - the ozone layer\nA battle what? Here's a bible start your prayer\nThis word to the wise is justified\nIf they ask you what happened - just admit you lied\nYou just got caught a - for going out of order\nAnd now you're servin' football teams their water\nYou messed with the master, word to Chuck\nAnd I'll wax cold tax, made sure you got dome\nYou just got dissed - all but dismissed\nSucker duck emcees - you get me pissed\nIt's no fun - being on the run\nBecause they got me - Public Enemy number one\nOne - One - One\nOne - One - One\nDon't you know, don't you know\nI got a posse over force to back me up\nWatch out, we got never the match\nAmbush attack on my back - doubleteamin', get creamed\nSo we have us\nWanna hear it again\nWe got a force - enemy down\nThe L.I. circuit sound\nAin't it Chuckie D, myself and KG - Flavor, DJ Melody\nOh yes, I presume it's the tunes - that make us groom\nTo make all the ladies swoom\nBut it's also the words from outer region - a goldboy session\nKickin' like Bruce Lee's chinese connection\nOn stereo - never ever\nAll wax - yes I'm talkin' about vinyl\nThey said stop freeze\nI got froze up\nBecause I'm Public Enemy number one\nOne - One - One\nOne - One - One\nOne - One - One\nFor all you suckers - liars, your cheap amplifiers\nYou crossed up wires are always starting fires\nYou grown up criers - now here's a pair of pliers\nGet a job like your mother - I heard she fixes old dryers\nYou have no desires - your father fixes tires\nYou try to sell ya equipment - but you get no buyers\nIt's you they never hire - you're never on flyers\nCause you and your crew - is only known as good triers\nKnown as the poetic political lyrical son\nI'm Public Enemy number one\nOne - One - One\nOne - One - One\nOne - One - One\nYeah, that's right Chuck man\nThat's what you gotta do\nYou gotta tell them just like that\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nCause yo man, let me tell you a little somethin' man\nThese brothers runnin' around - hard headed\nMakin' a little jealous\nYa know what I'm sayin'\nJust like that, ya know\nThey try to bring you down with 'em\nBut yo Chuck, you gotta let 'em know who's who in the world of beat\nYou gotta let 'em know that this is the 80's\nAnd we can get all the ladies\nAnd in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes\nAnd that's the way the story goes\nThat's just the way the story goes\nLet me tell you a little somethin' man\n",
