Who is pure?\nIs it European state of being, I'm not sure\nIf the whole world was to come\nThru peace and love\nThen what would we made of?\nExcuse us for the news\nYou might not be amused\nBut did you know white comes from Black\nNo need to be confused\nExcuse us for the news\nI question those accused\nWhy is this fear of Black from White\nInfluence who you choose?\nMan c'mon now, I don't want your wife\nStop screamin' it's not the end of your life\n(But supposin' she said she loved me)\nWhat's wrong with some color in your family tree\nI don't know\nI'm just a rhyme sayer\nSkins protected 'gainst the ozone layers\nBreakdown 2001\nMight be best to be Black\nOr just Brown countdown\nI've been wonderin' why\nPeople livin' in fear\nOf my shade\n(Or my hi top fade)\nI'm not the one that's runnin'\nBut they got me one the run\nTreat me like I have a gun\nAll I got is genes and chromosomes\nConsider me Black to the bone\nAll I want is peace and love\nOn this planet\n(Ain't that how God planned it?)\nExcuse us for the news\nYou might not be amused\nBut did you know White comes from Black\nNo need to be confused\nExcuse us for the news\nI question those accused\nWhy is this fear of Black from White\nInfluence who you choose?\n",
