    "lyrics": "Hard Truth Soldier radio\n\n\nBrothers and sisters, this is not a test\nI've been asked by Public Enemy leader Chuck D to make this emergency\nannouncement\nThe police in your cities, for all intents and purposes\nhave declared open season on black people (hey yo check one two)\nPublic Enemy was driven into the underground by government forces\nHowever a small resistance is forming\nBoth Terminator X and Chuck D have resurfaced\nLeading a small mobile rebel unit, \"The Valley of the Jeep Beats\" (1-2-3-4-5-6)\n\n\nHard rhyme and the rebel is on the mic\nOne time, rhyme animal's on the mic\nThey're still keepin, youth asleep an'\nWe in the hood with heat and still beatin\nAnd we back with the rap that packs the room\nBlack tracks with the rhythm that make you move\nCan't hush the bumrush, we bust the sound\nwith these sonic bombs, feel the pressure all around\nRaise the level I'm up again rhymin\nRidin on the devil since I began rhymin\nHell we bring back the meat that rap lacks\nCause like I said, we got sold down the river\nAnd I ain't for these racist wars\nA lie's fed by these TV whores\nI know it's more to news fake the truth\nWe break through won't lose we move with Public Enemy\n\n\nHard rhyme when the rebel is on the mic\nOne time rhyme animal's on the mic\n(It's P.E. - whattup - it's on you, brother what'chu wanna do)\n(Brother tell me if it's on, it's on)\n\n\nNow hip-hop was a gift that lifted up\nLoved rap 'til the companies ripped it up\nNow the soul is set, we've been had like jazz\nIf you down for change then they take your voice away\nAnd then they tell you the best is white\nCo-signed by a nigga that pimped the mic\nMake the rule the view that the beef is cool\nBut what it do is fool the few fools who buy the feud\nKeep the people all blind and dumb dancin\nNever let a record that wreck become rampant\nSee the street copycat the crap rap and songs\nNot knowin \"There's a POISON Goin' On\"\n'Til the message revealed and I show\nBut you never get to hear it on the radio\nJack be nimble, Jack be quick, fuck Jack!\nBust that, squeeze, rewind the shit, c'mon\n\n\n\n\n\"C'mon now!\" DJ Lord\n\"Here we go again\"\n\"C'mon now!\" Guerilla Funk\n(Hey yo check one..)\n\n\nWe move as a team to keep them demons out\nY'all know what I'm talkin about\nSee 'em used, abused, confused us into thinkin that\nbein ghetto mean the same as bein ignorant\nAnd so we strive to rise and get by\nNo peace for the beast we police and shine the light\nCulture vanish on the television pimpin those\non \"Cribs\" in a home that they never own\nDamn! Tell me that once again\nRadio and the video don't uplift\nTake a stand be demandin all my freedom and my civil rights\nWorldwide fight the plan and they genocide\nYes the road is long and hard\nAnd when I'm gone you'll say I did my part\nKeep gunnin, we the crew that never lose\non the ones and the motherfuckin twos, Public Enemy\n\n\n\n\nHey yo check one two\nYeah that's right, Flavor Flav takin you back to the next millineum\nYou know what I'm sayin? Always cold cold kille-enum\nYou know what I'm sayin? And I ain't playin\nIt's all in the message that we're layin\nI got a secret weapon, you know what I'm sayin?\nLet's take two steps to the rear, we gettin out of here\nYou know what I'm sayin? Operation Cold Killin 'Em to the next millenium\n\nFlavor Flav, rock the house\n\nHey yo check one two\n",
