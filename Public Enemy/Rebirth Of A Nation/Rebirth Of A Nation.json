To the beat y'all\n{\"Turn it up!}\nC'mon now! That's all?\nAh-ah-ah-aight I got it, ah-ah-alright y'all, alright y'all\n\n\nWe come rough with the rhythm and rhymes that pack 'em in\nBust with the rhythm that shines back once again\nStill ride with releases reachin each\nStill strive to revive and keep the peace\nAnd still knowin how to crush the mo'\nWe still showin with the monster flows that you know\nAnd bleed the beast that, keeps the peace back\nMust defeat that, bring that beat back!\nWhen X plays on the crossfades we rave\nTo make us all come together, brothers doin our thang\nIn this land where the plan is to blind the mind\nWe go wild and understand the grand design\nWe brought BACK what'cha missed, feel the voice resist\nBlack fist got us sittin on the government list (oh shit!)\nFrom the North to the near, hear it loud and clear\nThere's no fear, keep the people aware with Public Enemy\n\n\"The Enemy the Enemy the Enemy the Enemy\"\n\nRhyme animal\nC'mon Griff\nHear the beat go, Terminator what?\nDJ lord... c'mon now!\nGuerilla Funk'n\nTo the beat y'all, shakin the ground\nP.E.\nWhat a brother know\nOnce again back is the incredible\n\n\nIt's P.G. out the gutter to absorb the fight\nSix shots, slang shots, stick cops at night\nMight pass on the black ski-mask and gloves\nRevolutionary love, in Allah we trust\nThis one's for the workers in the struggle to rise\nFor the brothers in the pen and the women despised\nFor all the people's pain from the brain control\nFor niggaz in the game that done lost their soul\nHope goes to the folks don't hold the max\nAnd the ten percent blood suckin askin blacks\nto pass the gat, and snatch that book off the shelf\nIt don't mean shit without knowlege of self\nDon't trip when the real clip rip the club\nCause when the brothers get together we gon' all come up\nKeep it live in your ear so it's loud and clear\nThere's no fear keep the people aware with Public Enemy\n\n\"The Enemy the Enemy the Enemy the Enemy\"\n\nHuh! Terminator's back\nHear the beat go\nLet me hear you say c'mon now\nBring the noise - YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH\nHey yo check one two\nGuerilla Funk'n, here we go again\nHear the beat go, P.E.\nCold live, can cold live\n",
