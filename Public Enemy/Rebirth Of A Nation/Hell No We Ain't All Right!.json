While the rest of the Bush nation stares\nAs the drama unfolds, as we the people under the stairs\nFifty percent of this \"Son of a Bush\" nation\nis like, hatin on Haiti and settin up assassinations\nAsk Pat Robertson, quiz him (mmm - smells like terrorism)\nRacism in the news, still one-sided views\nSayin whites find food\nPray for the National Guard who be ready to shoot\nBecause they be sayin us blacks loot\n(What is your boy \"Son of a Bush\" doin?)\n(NUTTIN!)\n\n\nNew Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night\nHell naw! {HELL NAW} We ain't alright\n\n\nNew Orleans in the mornin afternoon and night\nHell naw! \"Damn, damn!\"\n\n\nNow them fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, I don't mean to scare\n... wasn't this written somewhere?\nDisgrace is all I be seein is hurtin black faces\nMoved out to all them far away places\n(Emergency) state, corpses alligators and snakes\nBig difference between this haze and (the little diamonds on the VMA's)\nYou better look what's really important\nY'all under the sun, especially if you over 21\nThis ain't no TV show, ain't no video (this is really real!)\nBeyond them same ol' keep it real\nquotes from them TV stars, drivin big rim cars (streets keep floodin B)\nNo matter where you at no gas, driving is a luxury (urgency)\nDon't y'all know? They said it's a state of emergency\nShow somebody's government is far from reality\n(Aiyyo check one two!)\n\n\n\n\nAnd they don't have a CLUE of what's going on down there\nI'm like you've gotta be kidding me, this is a NATIONAL disaster\nIt's awful down here man\nGod is lookin down on all this\nAnd if they are not doin everything in their power to save people\nThey are gonna pay the price\n\n\nNow I see we be the new faces of refugees, who ain't even overseas\nBut stuck here on our knees\nForget the plasma TV, ain't no electricity\nNew world's upside down and OUT of order\nShelter, food, what's up yo? (Where's the water?)\nNo answers from disaster, them masses be hurtin\nSo who the f#$! they call - HALLIBURTON?!\n\"Son of a Bush\" how you gonna just trust that cat\nto fix s%#t when all that help is stuck in Iraq?\nMakin war plans takin more stands in Afghanistan\nTwo thousands soldiers there dyin in the sand\nBut that's over there, right? What's over here?\nIt's a noise so loud some of y'all can't hear\nBut on TV I know that I can see\nBunches of people, lookin just like me\n\n\nNew Orleans\nMississippi\nAlabama\nU.S.A.\n\n\nWe definitely ain't alright\nAnd some of y'all voted for that cat! \"Son of a Bush\"\nThat's right, what God giveth sometimes your country taketh away\nYeah, one love, comin from Public Enemy, #1 y'all\nPublic Enemy, 2006 (yeah)\nPublic Enemy 2007, all gettin together now\n\n\nLet me tell y'all somethin\nAll of our hearts is out there with y'all, you know what I'm sayin?\nAnd we sendin trucks, we sendin boats\nBoxes of.. cans of soup and everything\nClothes and all of that, shoes\nWe donating everything to y'all, you know what I'm sayin?\nDon't worry, y'all ain't by yourself\nYou need to know that\n",
