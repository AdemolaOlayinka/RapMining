    "lyrics": "Things get hectic quick\nFrom the satellite dish to your joy stick\nIt's the night of the living cable box\nWires coming up from around the block\nRemote control to change the station\nBut that won't change your situation\nHave you seen what I mean\nI'm the little gnome that's in your dreams\nSo I say this rhyme built by design\nTo take you beyond space and time\nSaid who is the man making diamonds out of coal\nThe man pushing buttons on remote control\n\nRemote I want Control\nRemote I want Control\n\nUntil your back's up against the wall\nYou never know yourself that much at all\nSo you've got to share your love with a friend\nThat's all that you've got left in the end\nLiving in this city of pure confusion\nPeople misled by their own illusion\nAll this action, no satisfaction\nWe're all linked together like a chain reaction\nPlay or fold, love is bold\nWhat is the future that will unfold?\nSome like it hot, others like it cold\nBut we all want to hold the remote control\n\nRemote I want Control\nRemote I want Control\nRemote I want Control\nRemote I want Control\n\nThings get hectic quick\nAll of the sudden I'm in the thick\nToo much drama all around\nDistractions booming in sensuround\nLike a rainy day's Earth won't sit still\nSliding on down a hill\nSometimes life it seems to stall\nSo never be ungrateful y'all\nSo I got a little something for your pay per view\nLike Don King I've got the crazy hair do\nWe've got cameras on Mars on space patrol\nControlled on Earth by remote control\n",
