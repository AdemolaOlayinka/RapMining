Production that takes over France\nWith voo-doo dance and science arts\nScience machine and science dream\nThis is a living dream from the Beastly Brothers\nAnd the Beastly Boys with their beastly toys\nTo give you some beastly joys\nSo put on your beastly drawers\nAnd show me a beastly pose\nHahahaha...\n",
