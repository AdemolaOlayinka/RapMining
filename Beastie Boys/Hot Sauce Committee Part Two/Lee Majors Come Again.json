Ah-ah!\nI'm the lyrical mathematical genius\nSplashing like lime juice, you've never seen this\nInternationally known, the longest, the leanest\nShout out to one Jos\u00e9 Nenis\nI hit 'em with the rhyme and the rhyme don't stop\nYeah we got the beat and the beat go drop\nThe ping pong paddle make the batter go pop\nNow take a look around this spot\nI'm seeing every detail like an over-cranked camera\nSleestaks in the back say \"Damn ya!\"\nYou say \"I can't\", and I say \"Why can't you?\"\nChopping the track in the-in the land of...\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\nThere's a bird in here\nThat's my DJ, not Doctor Brassiere\nDropping bombs like a bombardier\nCocao he's a chocolatier\nWe're giving y'all a little slice of heaven\nB Boys bringing it back to A7\nDeal with the schism, ride on the rhythm\nSweet like pie and the pie's what I give 'em\nI'll stage a coup and usurp your position\n'Cause 'cause like a Mormon, we on a mission\nWe're audible-visible\nCadence is lyrical\nGot the mental and physical\nWhen the moment is critical\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\nRuff!\nUh, Lee Majors come again\nLike the 16 billion Dollar Man\nOoh! Watch out!\nIn the back of the bus, gonna bust\nLee Majors style\nI said stop! Watch how I flip\nBill Piedmont with the Kung Fu grip\nHaymaker, round house, show can't continue\nAt the roller rink down in Virginia\nOh, yeah, did I spill the beans?\nI see your grandpa in Apple Bottom jeans\nA Von Dutch cap, Ugg boots to match\nOnce the word gets out, you can't take it back\nI'm just a pause tape competition expert winner\nJust a doggone, long armed, tall yarn spinner\nYou want a battle? Easy now, star\nMy DJ's so nasty, he needs a sneeze guard\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\nYou wanna buy this\nYou wanna take that\nWanna wanna try this\nWanna wanna make that\nYou can't abide this\nYou wanna fake that\nTake a look around you\n",
