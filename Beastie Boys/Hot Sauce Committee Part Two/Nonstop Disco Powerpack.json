Well I feel all good\nAll day it's how we play in the neighborhood\n(Well how you feelin' MCA?) Well I feel right\nI speak my words on the track 'cause the track sound tight\n(So if you're feelin' good and you're feelin' right)\n(Uhh, somebody step up and grab the mic)\n\nWell hello everybody and how you been?\nIt's Ad Rock rappin' on the microphone again\nI got grace, class, style, finesse and debonaire\nMurdalize motherfuckers 'cause I just don't care\nThe MC whisperer, kinda like a trainer\nI take sucker rappers, I put 'em through a strainer\nLike macaroni 'cause their shit sound cheesy\nWatch how it's done B'woy, it looks easy\nI'm the nonstop, goin' off, king pin, microphone boss\nDo my own thing, you can't afford the cost\nOf my rhyme style take you through the turnstile\n'Cause I'm live and direct, and I'm wicked and wild\nBecause I'm back on a roll got total control\nI flow like the water out your toilet bowl\nYour style is cheap boy, just like a Dutch\nYou know you're not smokin' on the microphone much\nThere's a certain special talent that I never lack\nHuh ha huh ha! And that's a fact\n'Cause we shine like the chrome on a Cadillac\nYou better break a wishbone 'cause we're never wack\nSaid we're never that, and that is that\nAnd we're the nonstop disco powerpack\nUh, that's right, we go all night\nWho gonna be next to bless the mic?\n\nNow this is the way we run it down\nWe gettin' you high on the funky sound\nThis is the way we get it on\nB-Boys in the house 'til the break of dawn\n\nSee I mix my style up like a cement mixer\nSmooth and fix ya like a rhyme elixer\nI said \"yo sound man, make Mike's mic louder\"\nDon't make me sound cheap like a box of douche powder\nI max and relax, champagne, mojito\nDon't go commando, don't know bandito\nJe m'appelle Michel, Perignon\nMe and Claude in the chateau, and we got it goin' on\nQuincy's in the hot tub like it's '73\nLookin' over his shoulder and he's lookin' at me\nI'm all white in the face, towel around my waist\nWhat's up with that watch inside the glass case?\nI go to make my move, sneak out the place\nUndetected, not leavin' a trace\nParty's done, microphone wrecked\nWine's been drunk, and heads been checked\nI see one last profiterole, I make my play\nAnd pass the microphone to MCA\n\nNonstop, On the top, and you clock, when we rock\nNever fakin', no mistakin', we be makin' hip hop\nSo come on everybody get down... Yeah\nNow it's a spot check, hit the deck count down\n'Cause I'ma break it down for you how we run it down\nPound for pound, keep the bass lines round\nI seen you watchin', jockin', clockin' my sound\nBut for real, I'm real glad I grew up in hip hop\nStill got mad love for a record called Beat Bop\nIt mean a lot spinnin' on my Walkman\nShout out to the Afrikan Bam\nAnd to the S to the P the double O-N-Y\nThe one MC, who you can't deny\nI'd listen to the records and they'd inspire\nSit down to write and the pen breathes fire\nConstruct a rhyme with specific intent\nFlowin' from the brain cells right through the pen\nAnd then I put the book down, grab ahold the mic\nWords flowin' so cold, turn water to ice\nCome through the wire saturate the tape\nYou put me in the mix nice it up with the plate\nAnd then they press it on wax, sell it in the store\nThe DJ's spin the record out on the dance floor\nComin' through the speakers to shake your eardrum\nBrain cells get lit, then you hear where we're comin' from\n\nWell Ad Rock, HUH! Get it on\nWe gonna rock the house until the break of dawn\nNow Mike D, HUH! Get it on\nWe gonna rock the house until the break of dawn\nAnd MCA (AYAH) get it on\nWe gonna rock the house until the break of dawn\nBeastie Boys in the house, DON'T STOP!\n",
