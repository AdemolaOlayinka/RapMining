Ask Mike Dino\n\nI burn the competition like a flame thrower\nMy rhymes age like wine as I get older\nI'm getting bolder competition is waning\nI've got the ball and I see the lane and\nWe got a party on the left\nA party on the right\nWe gotta party for our mother fucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\n\nOur resurrection by popular election\nGet paid every year like tax collection\nHear my perfection a rotary connection\nTaking M.C.'s down by lethal rap injection\n\nI'm like an ornithologist when I get miffed\nYou must have drank a fizzy lifting drink and you got lifted\nAnd sifted - I'm just riffin'\nWhen I catch MC's it's time for wing clippin'\n\nI fly like a hawk or better yet a eagle a seagull\nI sniff suckers out like a beagle\nMy ego is off and runnin' and gone\n'Cause I'm about the best and if you fess well that's wrong\nWe got a party on the left\nA party on the right\nWe gotta party for our mother fucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\n\nPass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision\nI'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitchin'\nPut it in formaldehyde and put it on the shelf\nSo you can show it to your friends and say \"that's my old self\"\n\nCan't do me nothin' can't tell me nada\nDon't bug me now because I'm doin' the lambada\nThe forbidden dance, here's my chance\nTo make romance in my b-boy stance\n\nParlay my romancing into the financing\nOpen up a restaurant with Ted Danson\nThe roaches check in but they never check out\nI set the record straight no doubt\nWe got a party on the left\nA party on the right\nWe gotta party for our mother fucking right to fight\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\nMake some noise if you're with me\n",
