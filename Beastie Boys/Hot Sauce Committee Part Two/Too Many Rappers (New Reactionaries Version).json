We goin' out - goin' dutch\nNow pass me the sword - I'll start swingin'\nJust randomly chopping on a crazy ass mission\nBecause I'm back with the bang boogie\nOogie oogie\nStrawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie\nOh my god, just look at me\nGrandpa been rappin' since '83\nI'm supersonic like J.J. Fad\nGot crazy ass tricks pullin' out the bag\nDon't forget the tarter sauce, yo, 'cause it's sad\nAll these crab rappers, they're rapping like crabs\nI have carte blanche\nThe vagabond Nas is the narcissist\nMy pockets are rotund\nI'm no killer but compared to you\nI'm more realer\nYou ain't a shot caller mobster or a drug dealer\nA slug peeler, you're not, mafioso, no\nYou ain't got the cut throat in ya, beginner\nI ain't trying to hear your racket\nYou work for police\nDog, you snitch, you rat\nYou wear that jacket\nHow many rappers must get dissed?\nGive me eight bars and watch me bless this\nI start to reminisce and I miss\nReal hip hop with which I persist\nLike rum and mojitos\nBullets and banditos\nMatzoh balls and soup\nJackets and troop\nYes, y'all, this is one for the history books\nNasty Nas, what's the word? Count it off on the hook\nOne, one, two, two, three, three\nToo many rappers and there's still not enough MC's\nThree, three, two, two, one, one\nMCA, Ad-Rock, Mike D that's how we get it done\nLike ladies and gents, attention\nNas in the house with Beastie Boys, we can turn it out\nPerpetrators, we can point 'em out\nSo if you've got something on your mind, let it out\n'Cause this the type of lyric that goes inside your brain\nTo blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame\nMy lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister\nSo get your hologram on off of Wolf Blitzer\nToo many rappers to shake a stick at\nI ought to charge a tax, for every weak rap\nI had to listen to 'cause we'd be makin' stacks\n(Like Stax Records)\nMy squad, we got a pact, we're never comin' wack\nTo all you crab rappers and hackers\nAnd circuit benders tweaked on Splenda\nI take the cake, I stole the mold\nThat golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold\nNow why all these biters all up in my crotch space\nSniffin', buffin', huffin'\nAnd mean muggin' with the Blimpie Bluffin\nBack up off me, sucker, you ain't sayin' nothin'\nI'm broader than Broadway\nI was in project hallway\nDual tape recorder lacing oratorials all day\nI'm just gettin' started on this beat, this is foreplay\nAnd when the song is finished, I can sing along with this\nBy the way, I have a strong fetish\nFor Christian Louboutin steppers\nI hear that Russian blonde's the wettest\nBut anyway, y'all better pay homage to my fellas\nAnd that's what's on my mind\nAnd on the rhyme\nWho's next up?\nAaaaayah, Mike D, the man of mystery\nHistory in the making and now we're taking\nTitles, awards and accolades\nSkewer the competition as I sharpen my blades\nWe come together like peanut butter and sandwiches\nLike pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases\nRockin' stadiums to shitty bars\nGo back in time, send a fax from my car\nOne, one, two, two, three, three\nToo many rappers and there's still not enough MC's\nThree, three, two, two, one, one\nMCA, Ad-Rock, Mike D that's how we get it done\nLike ladies and gents, attention\nNas in the house with Beastie Boys, we can turn it out\nPerpetrators we can point 'em out\nSo if you've got something on your mind, let it out\nThat was dope\n",
