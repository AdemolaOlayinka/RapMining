GET UP!\nYeah, uhh...\nAnd then...\n\nYes here we go again, give you more, nothin lesser\nBack on the mic is the anti-depressor\nAd-Rock, no pressure, yes, we need this\nThe best is yet to come and yes, believe this\n\nLeggo my Eggo while I flex my ego\nSip on Prosecco, dressed up tuxedo\nSippin coffee playin Keno, in the casino\nWant a lucky number? Ask Mike Dino\n\nYo I burn the competition like a flame thrower\nMy rhymes, they age like wine as I get older\nI'm gettin bolder, competition is wanin\nI got the feelin, assume the lane and\n\nMake some noise if you're with me...\nMake some noise if you're with me...\n\nArmed insurrection, popular election\nGet paid every year like tax collection\nHear my perfection, rotary connection\nTakin emcees down by lethal rap injection\n\nI'm like an ornithologist, when I get pissed\nYou must have drank a fizzy-liftin drink and you got lifted\nAnd sifted, I'm just whiffin\nWhen I catch you emcees it's time for wing-clippin\n\nI fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle\nA seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle\nMy ego, is off, and runnin, and gone\nCause I'm about the best and if you diss then that's wrong\n\n\n\nPass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision\nI'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitchin\nPut it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf\nThen you can show it to your friends and say \"That's my old self\"\n\nCan't do me nuttin, can't tell me nada\nDon't quote me now because I'm doin the lambada\nThe forbidden dance, here's my chance\nto make romance in my b-boy stance\n\nParlayed romancin, into financin\nOpened up a restaurant with Ted Danson\nThe roaches check in, but they never check out\nI set the record straight, no doubt\n",
