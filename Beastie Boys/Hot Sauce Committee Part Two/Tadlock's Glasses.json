I sprinkle on some magic dust\nYou've got a bagel in your pants and that's a must\nPlus I cuss and I grab my nuts\nGot a six finger ring that says \"excuse our dust\"\n\nMike D's got it locked and we rock it nonstop\nAdRock's got it locked and we rock it nonstop\nMCA's got it locked and we rock it nonstop\nAnd you don't stop, the body rock\nSometimes things just don't connect\n",
