Now my name is Adrock I've got a story to tell 
When I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell 
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell 
And when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well 

Oh you didn't know I got the flow 
I could sing, rap, dance in just one show 
With the cornbread stuffin' with the Blimpie Bluffin 
Mother fuckin' Yosi with the goddamn muffins 
Hey could you please pass me the peas 
And let me get a tissue if you think your're gonna sneeze 
I'm the player and the coach I'm no roach 
I bought my grandma a brand new broach 

Well I'm MCA with a story to tell 
When I rock the crowd I rock the crowd well 
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell 
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well 

'Cause I'm a craftsman, who ain't fastin' 
I'll take you to task everyone of ya'll draftsman 
I'm rehearsin' and ain't maskin' 
Bringin' the beat back and keepin' it lastin' 
Keepin' it top notch, beyond passing 
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't flashin' 
I'm party crashin' so you better batten 
Down those hatches stop procrastin- 

Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell 
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell 
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell 
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well 

Went to the top and never went pop and 
Came back down but still not stopping 
I'm not even asking, "Yo what's cracking?" 
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan 
So start packing because I'm back in 
The game of hiphop reprenting Manhattan 

Now push the pause button then start ducking 
Shhhhh you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton, 
Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh, 
Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!!
