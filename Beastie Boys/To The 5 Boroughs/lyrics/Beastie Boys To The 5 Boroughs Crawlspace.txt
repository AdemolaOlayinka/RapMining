Beastie Boys
To The 5 Boroughs
2004)
There's a party going on in here for real 
I got more product than Ron Popeil 
So deal with that troop were troopers 
The only air time you get is on bloopers 
Beatsie Boys in the place up in the space 
So renovate or evacuate 
You better think twice before you start flossing 
I been in your bathroom often 
Taking punk MC's out I'm all about 
My to do list today is turn the party out 
Getting hot in here no room to breath 
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep 
No I'm not Herman Munster or Dr. Spock 
I go by the name of the King Adrock 
So here's a match my ass and your face 
Listen when I tell you dog; 
I'm in your crawl space 

You're in front of my house and you know that's wack 
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack 
You suckers try to front like you've got the force 
But I'll slay like Vader sip you for a first course 
Don't even get me started on intercourse... 
A 14! 9 
Don't step into my zone or even periphery 
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery 
The way you act a fool son you can't erase 
I'll have you running on your way like steeple chase 
You tried to take my title now put it back in place 
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace 
Steeling my style from my trophy case 
But my drive's secure like an army base 
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase 
But you ain't never gonna catch me; 
I'm in your crawl space 

Schematics, blueprints and microfilm 
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm 
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier 
And this extends beyond the Tri-State-Area 
Omnipresent and omnipotent 
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents 
This means huge compared to very small 
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shall? 
'Cause these rhymes are zoo proof 
They're like anvils lined up on a roof 
Waiting to drop on your corny melon 
'Cause were not buying what you're selling 
First you want to battle then you start to whine 
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time 
So run home where you feel safe 
But don't sleep Cochise; 
I'm in your crawl space
