Beastie Boys
To The 5 Boroughs
2004)
Back on the scene for ya'll people's delight 
You want peace for the people then ya say alright 
'Cause George W's got nothing on me 
We got to take the power from he 
When I'm on the mic I feel good to go 
Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa 
So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know 
And my zodiac sign is Scorpio 
Look what the cat dragged in 
The creme de la creme without the skin 
So take a rest and mind your own biz 

And that's it that's all that's all there is 

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 

One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan 
Let's go to work, get those hands clappin' 
Make you bounce, rock, roll and skate 
Don't underrate how I operate 
It ain't what you say, it's what you mean 
Intention leads to action, that is my theme 
So pay attention now as I begin to recap 
Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back 

Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz 
I got no time for the drama 'cause stress is for kids 
'Cause when you're dead and buried well you got no biz 

And that's it that's all that's all there is 

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 

Brand new 

The time and place for the mind is here and now 
Keep the mind present less to worry about 
But like the hammer to the nail hit the nail on the head 
Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead 
Well I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh 
T-shirt and no pants and I dance the bugaloo 
Like George Whipple on New York One 
Got a hairy ass and that's no fun 
I'm in the rhyme zone a different time zone 
And on the microphone you know that I'm at home 
It's time we looked past all our differences 
An' that's it that's all that's all there is 
Come on 

Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 

An' that's 
Fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you 
That's fresh...fresh...fresh...for you...for you...for you
