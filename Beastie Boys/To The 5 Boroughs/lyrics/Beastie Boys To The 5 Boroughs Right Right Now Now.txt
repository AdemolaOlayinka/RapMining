Beastie Boys
To The 5 Boroughs
2004)
Once upon a time up on this mic 
MC's be really workin' on what they write 
With the sound delight we rock all night 
And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight 
We're international like Matt Takei 
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei 
Still around the way is where we'll stay 
Say what we mean, mean what we say 
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and 
What we do now is future moulding 
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen 
We need a bit more gun controlling 

Right, Right, Now, Now 
What is goin' on? 
We, We, Gotta, Gotta 
Get it goin' on 
Be, Be, Fore, Fore 
It's Too Far Gone 
We gotta work together, it's been too long 

When I get on you scream "Hoo Tight!" 
Rockin' this flow I could go all night 
I'm not here to fight, or incite 
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright 
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation 
The US attacking other nations 
And narration, on every station 
False election's got me losing my patience 
I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way 
And yes I got to say fuck the KKK 
And oh yeah hey, how about today? 
If you want to set it off then let me hear you say 

Right, Right, Now, Now 
What is goin' on? 
We, We, Gotta, Gotta 
Get it goin' on 
Be, Be, Fore, Fore 
It's Too Far Gone 
We gotta work together, it's been too long 

I went to get a loan and they asked my race 
I wrote down human inside the space 
It's a disgrace how they try to debase 
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace 
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise 
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice 
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice 
So please pass me the Reunite on ice 
Well let's go to work and not beserk 
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt 
Try to smooth it out like Levert 
Keep the mind alert and not revert 

Right, Right, Now, Now 
What is goin' on? 
We, We, Gotta, Gotta 
Get it goin' on 
Be, Be, Fore, Fore 
It's Too Far Gone 
We gotta work together, it's been too long
