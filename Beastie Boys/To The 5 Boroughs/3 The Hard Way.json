Morrow out on Ave L\nWe be grillin' cheese and flippin' flapjacks\nWith the diamond stylus we cutting wax\nWe're the super elastic bubble plastic\nGot ethereal material that's straight up classic\nYou try to vex reject but you should respect\nOr we'll have JC send you out a FedEx * 1\nSo don't start to flex up in the discotheque\nOr we'll make you extinct tyrannosaurus rex\n\nWe're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way\n\nYour rhyme technique, it is antique\nTo all my heads Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?\nQue cosa fai? Come sta e?\nHo fato molte telefonate\nOops gotcha clutch like Plazza\nSneak between the sheets so hide like matzoh\nHoller back challah bread... next\nWe are the crew who put the crew in Cruex\nI can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me\nI'm Mike D the one who put the satin in your panties\nTime to count MC's in this place to be\nNot five, not four, not two, just three\n\nWe're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way\n\nRound-house kick the mic out your hand\nDrunken mantis, my name brand\nSo if you're slick with the tricks and the slight of hand\nI'm hip top the shit that you're trying to scam\nGnip Gnop I got shit to pop\nI'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop\nSo pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait\nE.T. phone home now get the fuck out my face\nYou know we shake'em bake'em then we take'em\nTreat MCs like leaves go out and rake'em\nIf you sell our CDs on Canal before we make'em\nThen we will have no alternative but to serve you\non a platter like Steak'Em\n\nWe're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way\n",
