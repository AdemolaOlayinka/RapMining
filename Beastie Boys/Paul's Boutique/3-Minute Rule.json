A. U. C. H.\nI'm takin' all M.C.'s out in the place\nTakin' life as it comes no fool am I\nI'm goin' off gettin' paid and I don't ask why\nPlayin' beats on my box makin' music for the many\nKnow alota def girls that would do anything\nA lot of parents like to think I'm a villain\nI'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan\nI smoke cheeba it helps me with my brain\nI might be a little dusted but I'm not insane\nPeople come up to me and they try to talk shit man\nI've been making records since you were sucking on your mother's dick\n\nGirl you're walking tall now with your fancy clothes\nYou got fancy things going up your nose\nYou get fancy gifts from expensive men\nYou're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen\nMothership connection getting girl's affection\nIf your life needs correction don't follow my direction\nYou got your 8 by 10 your agent your Harley\nYou be driving around Hollywood yes sorry charlie\nCause I'm running things like some Mack motherfucker\nYour only claim to fame is you're a false fake sucker\nYou slip you slack you clock me you lack\nWhile I'm reading on the road by my man Jack Kerouac\nPoetry in motion coconut lotion\nI had to diss the girl because she got too emotional\nAre you experienced little girl\nI want to know what goes on in your little girl world\nCause I'm on your mind it's hard to forget me\nI'll take your pride for a ride if you let me\nSo peace out ya'll I'm PCP so I'm out\nFull throttle to the bottle and full full clout\nAnd I'm out\n",
