Plank Bee\nMe and my crew out breaking windows\nThe bingo the lotto you know I'll never win those\nPossession is half the law\nI had my routines before all y'all\nYour whole life is coming apart at the seams\nYou ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines\nI'm a city slicker I ain't no townie\nRight now I wish I had another hash brownie\nLike Ricky always said you've got to toke and pass\nOr Mookie's gonna kick your fuckin' ass\nYou try to take what isn't yours like a God damn rat\nSee personally I wouldn't want to go out like that\n\nI'm a writer a poet a genius I know it\nI don't buy cheeba I grow it Marijuana\nPeople always trying to get next to me\nI had a beautiful experience on Ecstasy\nSmoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer\nBecause I had to deal with a money hungry miser\nHad a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush\nSaw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush\nYou be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror\nMy girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her\nYou can't deny me you always want to try me\nYou're just gonna get your ass kicked\nHomeboy throw in the towel\nYour girl got dicked by Ricky Powell\nThe Godfather of Soul is in the belly of the beast\nFor smoking that dust at St. Anthony's Feast\n\nAll the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters\nSitting in the White House pulling their peters\nBuy my cheeba from the cop down the street\nThe only cop with a rope chain walking the beat\nLike a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'\nLike the beat to my rhyme just kickin'\nSpace cake cookies I discover who I am\nI'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man\nFive-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains\nSaid good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants\nMy mind is kinda rhymin and I think I oughta think\nSo I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink\nSo the lights are flashing my mind is spinning\nI feel like it is always the beginning\nOf another rhyme I'm rapping M.C.'ing I rock\nYou ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped\n",
