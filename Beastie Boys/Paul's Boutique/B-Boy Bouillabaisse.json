    "lyrics": "get on the mic mike let's be real and don't cloud the issue\nthe rhymes are dope an m.c. you must listen to\npeople say that they been missin' me and missin' you\nget on the mic and let's show them like we used to\nyou say fuck that yo holmes fuck this\nthe king ad-whammy your dick butkus\none half science and the other half soul\nhis name's mike d. not fat morton jelly roll\nm.c. busy le disco fooled around in fresno\ngot over on your girlie cause you know she never says no\nwell mike d. is a special individual\npulling out knots pulling in residuals\ngo to the movies get the rolos the cholos riding slow and low\nmike on the mic and bust with the solo\nmike my stromy don't be so selfish\nget on the mic cause you know you eat shellfish\n\n\n\n\nit's 4:00 a.m. i've got the dr. hfuhruhurr ale\ni've got nothing to lose so i'm pissin' on the third rail\ngroggy eyed and fried i'm headed for the station\nd-train ride to coney island vacation\ndedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train\nthey'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine\nthen i ump the turnstyle i lost my last token\nriding between the cars pissing smoking\nhead for the last car fluorescent light blackout\npoliceman told my homeboy put that crack out\nyou know you light up when the lights go down\nthen you read the new york post fulton st. downtown\nsame faces every day but you don't know their names\nparty people going placed on the d-train\n\ntrench coat wing tip going to work\nand you'll be pulling a train like captain kirk\npick pocket gangsters paying their debts\ni caught a bullet in the lung from bernie goetz\noverworked and underpaid staring at the floor\nprostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors\nstuck between the stations it seems like an eternity\nsweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity\n$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace\nthe neck tortoise your lees are creased\nhot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin\nfriday night and jamaica queens funkin\nelevated platform never gonna conform\nriding over the diner where i always get my toast warm\nbust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes\nover the loud speaker about the hard times\nsat across from a man readin el diario\nriding the train down from el barrio\nwent from the station straight to orange julius\ni bought a hot dog from my man george drakoulias\n\n\n\n\nm.c. for what i am and do\nthe a is for adam and the lyrics; true\nso as pray and hope and the message is sent\nand i am living in the dreams that i have dreamt\nbecause i'm down with the three the unstoppable three\nme and adam and d. were born to m.c.\nand my body and soul and mind are pure\nnot polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure\njust lyrics from i to you recited\narrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted\nenter the arena as i take center stage\nthe lights set low and the night has come of age\ntake the microphone in hand as that i am a professional\nspeak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special\nfor i am a bard but not the last one\ni'm my own king and this is my castle\ndwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past\nseen a glimpse from ahead and i don't think it's gonna last\nand you can bet your ass\n\ni drop the l. when i'm skiing\ni'm smoking and peaking\ni put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend\ncan't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along\ncan't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong\nbroke my bindings the lion with wings\npreaching his word in the b. boy sing\ni am one with myself as i turn to the\ni prefer the dreams to reality\ni prefer my life don't need no other man's wife\ndon't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife\nbut it's good to have turn to be a king for a day\nor for a week or for a year or for a year in a day\ncome what may\n\ni'm fishing with my boat and i'm fishing for trout\nmix the bass ale with the guiness stout\nfishing for a line inside my brain\nand looking out at the world through my window pane\nevery day has many colors cuz the glass is stained\neverything has changed but remains the same\nso once again the mirror raised and i see myself as clear as day\nand i am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny\nfeeling as though somebody were testing me\nhe who sees the end from the beginning of time\nlooking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be\ncheck the prophetic sections of the pages\n\nhe goes by the name of disco dave\n\n\n\n\nhello brooklyn\n\nnew york new york it's a hell of a town\nthe bronx is up and i'm brooklyn down\nthey don't know my name they only know my initials\nbuilding bombs in the attic for elected officials\ni quit my job i cut my hair\ni cut my boss cause i don't care\nyou tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle\nyou're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle\ncause being as fly as me is something you never thought of\nyou'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off\nlike a buffalo soldier i'm broader than broadway\nkeep keepin' on i don't care what they say\ni play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors\ni want to enjoy the fruits of my labor\ncause i am the holder of the 3-pack bonanza\nif you open the book then you will get your hand slapped\ni am the keeper of the 3-pack bonanza\nif you ask a question you will get the answer\nher breast i saw i reached i felt\nm.o.n.e.y. the belt\ni stay at home just like a hermit\ni got the jammy but i don't got the permit\nyes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is slick nick\nthat is why annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick\ni ride around town cause my ride is fly\ni shot a man in brooklyn just to watch him die\n\n\n\n\nhe thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost\nhe thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost\nshe's slippin through his fingers as she's movin' out to the coast\nhe thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost\n\nif your world was all black and if your world was all white\nthen you wouldn't get much color out of life now right\nnicknamed shamrock my name is not shamus\ngirlies on the tippy cause my homie is famous\nmy name is not o'houigheighi nor is it brian\nif i said that i was weak you know i'd be lyin'\nsuckers try to bite they try to pursue it\nif you explain to a musician he'll tell that he knows it but he just can't do it\n\n\n\n\nchinese eyes and chinese suits\nsmokin' much buddha and smokin' much boots\nmore updated on the hip-hop lingo\nmy favorite new york knick was hawthorne wingo\nmet a girl at a party and i gave her my card\nyou know that it said napoleon bonaparte\npeepin' out the colors i be buggin' on cezanne\nthey call me mike d joe blow the lover man\nyour face turns red as your glass of wine\nyou spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time\ngirl you should be with me you should drop that bum\ncause i got more flavor than fruit striped gum\nwith that big round butt of yours\ni'd like to butter your muffin i'm not bluffin'\nserve you on a platter like thanksgiving stuffin'\n\n\n\n\nhere's another one for y'all to peep\nit's called m-i-k-e on the m-i-c.\n\ni met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle\ni laid the bait and then she took the tackle\nhad too much to drink at the red lobster\nnow the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter\ni never met a girl that was too finicky\nif the press has their way then they're going to finish me\nyou might know this but you've never been this see\nif i ate spinach then i'd be called spinach d\ni shed light like cats shed fur\nride around town like raymond burr\ni'm so high that they call me your highness\nif you don't know me then pardon my shyness\ni live in the village wherever i go i walk to\ni keep my friends around so i have someone to talk to\ni play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it\nit's a trip it's got a funky beat and i can bug out to it\n",
