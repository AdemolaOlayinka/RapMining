Adam Yauch in the place to be\nAnd all the girls are on me cause I'm down with Mike D.\nI'm down with Mike D. and it ain't no baloney\nFor real, not phony \"O.E.\" and Rice-a-Roni\nI come out at night 'cause I sleep all day\nAnd I'm the King Adrock and he's M.C.A.\nWell I'm cruising, I'm bruising I'm never ever losing\nI'm in my car I'm going far and dust is what I'm using\nAround the way is where I'm from\nAnd I'm from Manhattan and I'm not a bum\nBecause you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping - got that juice\nMy name's Mike D. and I can do that Jerry Lewis\n\n\n\nHip-hop, body rockin' doing the do\nBeer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue\nBelly flipping, always illing, busting caps\nMy name's Mike D. and I write my own snaps\nI'm a peep-show seeking on the forty-deuce\nI'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose\nPistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum\nI come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from\nCheap-skate, perpetrating - money hungry jerk\nEveryday I drink a \"O.E.\" and I don't go to work\nYou drippy nose knuckle-head - you're we behind the ears\nYou like men - and we like beer.\n\n\n\nKing of the Ave. with the Def female\nYou're rhyming and stealin' with the freshest ale\nCooling at the crib watching my TV\nEd Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. Ed\nPump it up homeboy just don't stop\nChef Boy-ar-dee cooling on the pot\nI take no slack cause I got the knack\nAnd I'm never dusting out cause I torch that crack\nThe King Adrock that is my name\nAnd you're drinking Moet we got the champagne\nA quarter dropping going shopping buying wigs\nSurgeon general cut professor D.J.
