I've got a license to kill\nI think you know what time it is it's time to get ill\nNow what do we have here an outlaw and his beer\nI run this land, you understand I make myself clear.\"\nWe stepped into the wind he had a gun, I had a grin\nYou think this story's over but it's ready to begin\n\n\"Now I got the gun you got the brew\nYou got two choices of what you can do\nIt's not a tough decision as you can see\nI can blow you away or you can ride with me\" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border\nThe sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter\nI did it like this, I did it like that\nI did it with a whiffleball bat\nSo I'm on the run the cop's got my gun\nAnd right about now it's time to have some fun\nThe King Adrock that is my name\nAnd I know the fly spot where they got the champagne.\"\nWe rode for six hours then we hit the spot\nThe beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot\nThis dude was staring like he knows who we are\nWe took the empty spot next to him at the bar\nM.C.A. said, \"Yo, you know this kid?\"\nI said, \"I didn't.\" but I know he did\nThe kid said, \"Get ready cause this ain't funny\nMy name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money.\"\nPulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky\nHe yelled, \"Stick 'em up!\" and let two fly\nHands went up and people hit the floor\nHe wasted two kids that ran for the door\n\"I'm Mike D. and I get respect\nYour cash and your jewelry is what I expect\"\nM.C.A. was with it and he's my ace\nSo I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face\nThe piano player's out the music stopped\nHis boy had beef and he got dropped\nMike D. grabbed the money M.C.A. snatched the gold\nI grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.\n",
