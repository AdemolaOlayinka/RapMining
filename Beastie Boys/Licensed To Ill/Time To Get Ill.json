I've got a license to kill\nWhat's the time? it's time to get ill\n\nRiding down the block with my box in my hand\nToday I feel like chillin' just as chill as I can\nCoolin' on the corner with a forty of O.E.\n'Cause me and M.C.A. we're down with Mike D.\nWhen I run a jam I don't give a damn\nWhen I'm throwing bass I say, \"Thank you ma'am.\"\nFuel injected, rhyme connected running things\nI'm the King Adrock and I'm the king of all kings\nI'm looking for a spot things are gettin' hot\nI'm M.C.A., I'm here to stay and you sir, are not\nOh no, it could not be it's such a sight to see\nIt's such a trip you're on my tip so listen to Mike D.\nMy work is my play cause I'm playing when I work\nMy name's Mike D., as you can see and I can dot the jerk\nM.C.A., Adrock, Mike D. - it's chill\nWhat's the time? it's time to get ill\n",
