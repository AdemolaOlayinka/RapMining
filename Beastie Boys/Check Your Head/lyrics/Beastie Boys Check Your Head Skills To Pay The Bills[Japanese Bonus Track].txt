I'm mike d and I'm bustin' out trap kits
The time has come so I'm going to rap this
You Rip Van Winkle now you're gonna wake up
MC's pick up a hobby that you're gonna take up
On the stage I'm known to break fool
But when I'm at the table it's the Futterman's rule
Workin' on my game cause it's time to tax
I'm on a crazy mission to wax Bob Mack shit
Up to the top, 'till the very last drop
I'm make you pay for the rhymes I take
I'm selling sex rhymes by the pound
You horny MC's I watch you getting around my...

So it better pull through when it comes to me
Let it go down like it's supposed to be
Words together like birds in a flock
Agh yes rhymes on time like the hands on a clock
Well I'm an epileptic, a skept-a-cleptic
I'm cutting up the beats from the bear I clept it
I fucked around and then I lost my tooth
I'm telling everybody it's the goddamned truth
Like Dennis Coffey I'm a Scorpio
Like my man Schneider, I'm a super ho
Making mountains out of molehills and rockin' some mo' skills
Butt naked beats with butt naked fills
I got the skills - what skills
To pay the bills
I got the skills - what skills
To pay the bills
I got the skills - what skills
To pay the bills
I got the skills to pay the bills ya'll
A-wella wella wella wella welcome back
I don't sell bullets and I don't sell crack
Rub a little oil on my neck and back
Now listen baby doll we outta hit the sack
The original young aboriginal
Continued evolution of an individual well I'll tell ya
Got so many rhymes ya know my throat is sore
It's 1992 and still no one to vote for
Well like my words is what I'm seeing through my own eyes
A little vision of the truth in a world of lies
When it comes to coming off I like to get my fill
