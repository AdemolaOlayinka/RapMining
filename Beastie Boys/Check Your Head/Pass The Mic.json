Y'All\nMy Name Is M.C.A. And I Still Do What I Please\nAnd Now I'd Like To Introduce what's up?\nI'll Pass The Mic To D. For A Fist Full Of Truth\n\nThe Name Is D. Y'All And I Don't Play\nAnd I Can Rock A Block Party 'Til Your Hair Turns Grey\nSo, What You Sayin'? I Explode On Site\nI'm Like Jimmy Walker I'm Dynomite\nAnd Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic\nTo Adrock C'mon And Do Anything You Like\n\nI'm The A.D.R.O.C.K.\nIn The Place With The Bass I'm Going All The Way\nI Can't Stop Y'All Tock Tick Y'All\nAnd If You Think That You're Slick You'll Catch A Brick Y'All\n'Cause I'm A Turn It In And I'm A Turn It Out\nBut Now I've Got To Pass The Mic To Yauch\n\nWell On And On And On And On I Can't Stop Y'All 'Til The Early Morn'\nSo Rock Rock Y'All Tick Tock Y'All To The Beat Y'All\nC'mon And Rock Y'All\n\nI Give Thanks For Inspiration It Guides My Mind Along The Way\nA Lot Of People Get Jealous, They're Talking About Me\nBut That's Just 'Cause They Haven't Got A Thing To Say\n\nEverybody's Rapping Like It's A Commercial\nActin' Like Life Is A Big Commercial\nSo This Is What I've Got To Say To You All\nBe True To Yourself And You Will Never Fall\nAnd Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic To The A\n\nSo What's Your Name, Yauch? My Name Is M.C.A.\nI've Been Coming To Where I Am From The Get Go\nFind That I Can Groove With The Beat When I Let Go\nSo Put Your Worries On Hold\nGet Up And Groove With The Rhythm In Your Soul\nAnd Now I'd Like To Pass The Mic\nTo My Brother Adrock C'mon And Shine Like A Light\n\nYes Yes Y'All And Yes Yes Y'All\nI'm Always On Time Never The Less Y'All\nAnd That's Right Y'All, I Shed Light Y'All\nI've Got No Time In My Life To Get Uptight Y'All\nSo What You Gonna Say That I Don't Know Already?\nI'm Like Clyde And I'm Rockin' Steady\nBut Time Flies When You're Having Fun\nSo Mike D That's Me C'mon And Get Some\n\nM.I.K.E. To The D.\nYou Come And See Me And You Pay A Fee\nDo What I Do Professionally\nTo Tell The Truth I Am Exactly What I Want To Be\nNow Ad-Rock Huh? And M.C.A. Yeh?\nLet's Rock This Joint In The Old School Way\n\nWell I'm On 'Til The Crack Of Dawn\nMowing Down M.C.'s Like I'm Mowing A Lawn\nI Go Off Like Nothing Can Phase Me\nYou Think We'll Ever Meet Stevie? One Of These Days, D.\nBut I Can Stand My Ground And I Am Down\nTo Wax An M.C. Who Acts Like A Clown\nBut For Now, I'd Like To Ask You How\nYou Like The Feel Of The Bass In Your Face In The Crowd\n",
