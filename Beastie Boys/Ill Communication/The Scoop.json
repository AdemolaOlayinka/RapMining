That Means Do It Yourself\nI Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help\nDon't Sit Back And Say Good Enough\nKeep On Striving, Reinventing But Keeping It Off\nThe Cuff\nSo Kick The Level Up Cuhootnified\nMackadocius Vibes Positively Fortified\nI'm Throwing Rhymes Down Kicking Them Downtown\nTraveling High Speed Through The Underground\nI Kick It Free Style, Make It Worth Your While\nI've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File\nI'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again\nNew York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In\n\nA Blast From The Grasshoff Awhile It's Been\nStepping Into The Future Again\nI'm Straight From The 88 To 93 To 94, I'm Out The Door\nStep Into The Party With The Fila Fresh Gear\nPeople Looking At Me Like I Was David Koresh Here\nKicking Rhymes From The Heart 'Cause That's Where I'm At\nFuck The Bullshit, Be It Far From Me To Pop That\nIn The Search For Truth, I Go A Lot Of Ways\nThere's Not A Lot Of Peace, That I Find These Days\nI Try To Stay Cool, I Try To Stay Calm\nBut My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb\nSo I'll Say It Like The Group Huggy Bear\nThere's A Boy-Grrrl Revolution Of Wich You Should Be Aware\nYou Can't Dis Me, It Ain't Worth It, B\nYou Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See\nCause I Don't Play That, I Know Who I Am\nFor A Minute, I Did But Now I'm Back Again\nI'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G\nWell I Stopped Smoking Cheeba\nAnd That Was Part Of The Key\nWe've Got Fire, We Need Water\nThere ain't No Water So I Guess I Ought To\nLeave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind\nAnd I'm Blind And I'm Working Overtime, So Check It\nI Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book\nAnd I Know You Want To Take Another Look\n",
