(Hey, must be the money!)\n\nIf you wanna go and get high wit me\nSmoke a L in the back of the Benz-y\nOh why must I feel this way? (Hey, must be the money!)\n\n\nIn the club on the late night, feelin right\nLookin tryin to spot somethin real nice\nLookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home\n(I can take home)\nShe can be 18 (18) wit an attitude\nor 19 kinda snotty actin real rude\nBut as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on\n(Know that it's on)\nI peep something comin towards me on the dance floor\nSexy and real slow (hey)\nSayin she was peepin and I dig the last video\nSo when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?\nHer measurements were 36-25-34\nI like the way you brush your hair\nAnd I like those stylish clothes you wear\nI like the way the light hit the ice and glare\nAnd I can see you boo from way over there\n\n\n\n\nFace and body front and back, don't know how to act\nWithout no vouchers on her boots she's bringin nuttin back\nYou should feel the impact, shop on plastic\nwhen the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that\nWatch me as I gas that, folk got sick paid\nWatch the candy paint change, everytime I switch lanes\nIt feel strange now\nMakin a livin off my brain, instead of 'caine now\nI got the title from my momma put the whippin on end now\nDamn shit done changed now\nRunning credit checks with no shame now\nI feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)\nShit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town\nI'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B.\nTellin me about a party up in NYC\nAnd can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight\nPayin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White\n\n\n\n\nCheck, check - yo, I know somethin you don't know\nAnd I got somethin to tell ya\nYou won't believe how many people, straight doubted the flow\nFolks said that I was a failure\nBut now the same motherfuckers askin me fo' dough\nAnd I'm yellin, \"I can't help ya\"\n\"But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?\"\nHell no (what's witchu?!) you for real?!\n\nHey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high\nNiggaz wanna know why, why I fly by\nBut yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood\nDo me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good\nWe be them stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz\nPoppin like we drug dealers, simply cause she butt-naked\nHoney in the club, me in the Benz\nIcy grip, tellin me to leave wit you and your friends\nSo if shorty wanna... knock, we knockin to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... rock, we rockin to this\nAnd if shorty wanna... pop, we poppin the Crist'\nShorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist\nCity talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen\nWhen I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention\nSee the ice and the glist'; niggaz starin or they diss\nHonies lookin all they wish - come on boo, gimme kiss\n\n\n\nHey, must be the money!\n",
