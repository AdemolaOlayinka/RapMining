    "lyrics": "I remember back when, how the Kid got scarred\nBeggin' for pussy; bitches actin' hard\nI gots no play for the lack of papers\nFor the dope boys, I had the vapors\n'Cause they got the hoes for the money they were stackin'\nAnd all I had was dreams of rappin'\nBut a few months later the scenario changed\nWith a record and a video; now the Kid had game\nThey jumped over buildings, straight on the dick\nIt hit me so hard thinkin' I was it\nThey tripped me out, a sudden change of flavor\nHoes kissin' my ass wantin' to do me favors\nBut no matter how they tried to fuck with my pride\nIce Cold Productions won't slip or slide\n'Cause when I was comin' up you was talkin' shit\nNow that I made a nigga suck a dick\nI know what's happenin', don't think I'm dumb\nKid Ice is movin' up, so here I come!\n\n\n\n\n\nMarquis is the man, and I'm on a mission\nTo make a lot of money is my main ambition\nFuck niggas, and fuck hoes too\nThe meal is made, so let's eat food\nBut some motherfuckers try to hold ya back\nSome are white, but most are black\nGoin' out like that makes me laugh\nBut they all can kiss the crack of my ass\nAnd you know and I know who I'm talkin' about\nY'all need to shut your fuckin' mouth and step aside!\nYou better make way, 'cause here I come, motherfucker!\n\n\n\n\nSteppin' to the light, and out the darkness\nTo relieve the pressure and all the madness\nSo here I come, a young man on the rise\nDoin' what's right to stay alive\nIn a world of negativity and full of pain\nWe're brothers, down with each other for they own gain\nSo I keep on steppin', and keep on rappin'\nStatyin' above the others, you know what's happenin'\nFor the better of myself, and not the fame\nI try to make a livin' in this hip-hop game\nIf you wanna try, come and get some\nStep out my way, 'cause here I come!\n\n\n\n\nMr. Mixx, producer of 2 Live! Niggas slip, but I'ma let\nthat slide. Dope producer, you know I ain't playin',\ngot 3 golds and a platinum, y'know what I'm sayin'? Fuck-\nniggas always talk that fuck-shit, sayin' that Mixx ain't\nlegit. For the niggas that ain't with it, you can suck me\nand all the boys' dick, y'know what I'm sayin'? 2 Live in\nmotherfuckin' effect, and we outta this raggedy mother-\nfucker, like last year.\n",
