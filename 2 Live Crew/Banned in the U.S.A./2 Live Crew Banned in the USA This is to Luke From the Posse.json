Hit it!\nSo why has it gotta be so damn HOT?\n\n\nI'm the X-Minista, from the troop called P.E.\nProfessor Griff in the flesh, sincerely\nKickin' it off on a ghetto track\nBringin' to you some actual facts\nFrom the bottom, known as Miami\nWith the help from a posse called the L.A.D.\nEducate is what we do\nWith permission from the 2 Live Crew\n'Cause the Crew is 2 Live for you people\nWho run around, changin' laws, just to say we're equal\nFile a complaint, turn in your risume\n'Cause the A.G.S. don't play\nI'm the Griff, and I speak profound\nI'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!\n\n\nYo, check out the Mr. Mixx beat that I flow off\nWhile I go off to boast, brag, and show off\nAnd watch your (??) as I get hyper\nI cause them all to slip in they pants; they need a diaper\nWhoever stereotyped me for each of those nerds,\nI'ma get 'em a fork so they can eat those words\nIt was said we can't freestyle in M-I-A-M-I\nWe only had the weak rappers, but tell me, am I?\nLejuan's the type to take your whole gang out\nYou musta got curfew, because they can't hang out\nI'm gettin' paid 'cause I'm good; it's no mystery\nYou see, I'm rollin' with the man that's makin' history\nLejuan Love is one of the best around\nI'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!\n\n\nIn this type of M-U-S-I-C\nI know I'm braggin', but I'm the best I see\nI seen professionals, but I'm the better master\nWho you gonna blast up on your ghetto blaster?\nWhen I start to flow you're guaranteed to hear the raw stuff\nThey say I'm dope, nice, super good, or rough\nIf you don't know the game, then I gotta show the lame\nThat I'm the best out, nobody can flow the same\nAm I a threat? Nobody can say no\nI'm like a volcano, and I'm sure that they know\nWhen I come off, it's guaranteed legit\nCan you come like this? Naw, that's bullshit\nJT Money is the best around\nI'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!\n\n\nI got pull like gravity but some got no juice\nDeb in the flesh, well I'm fresh like produce\nSuckas never bite my stuff when they competin'\nIt's just too raw for them to think about eatin'\nIf y'all ain't heard the word, my rap lingers\nThe drop sounds like it's hot and burnin' my fingers\nThis rapper's tryin' to front on a real smooth flower\nThey ass is grass, and I'm the lawn mower\nOf course I put 'em out like trash 'cause I'm a lyncher\nAttackin' punk rappers like a Doberman Pincher\nThey all be like vampires to me, so they oughta\nWalk or get burnt, 'cause I'm the Holy Water\nYou say you wanna battle, but that'd be your doom\n'Cause I'll have you on your ass like Fruit of the Loom\nThe name's Debonaire and I'm one of the best around\nI'm down with Luke and the Ghetto Bass sound!\n\n\nThough I'm from the bottom, I'm placed by the rest out\nBrother Marquis is one of the best out\nThere's no comparin' me, I'm far from bein' so-so\nI top the suckas droppin' fast and flowin' slow\nPuttin' suckas out like I was Nyquil\nI rock on the mike like no other on the mike\nWe're your worst nightmare, if not scarier\nTheir loss in the (??) new to the area\nThe man you can't handle, 'cause I'm just too rough\nThey say that I'm good; they should 'cause it's true stuff\nSo ain't nobody sayin' that I'm not legit\nThey need to wipe they mouth, 'cause they just talkin' shit\nWhen it comes to droppin' science, I'm the man you can't knock out\nThe heavyweight champ that'll take your whole block out\nMarquis, one of the best around\nYeah, down with Luke and that Ghetto Bass sound!\n",
