Just a minute, erm,\nthis is a little to controversial, and I don`t think.. erm,\nWe are going to be up and here comes that black\nWatch yourself, he is kind of smart, you know...\n\n\nThis story began five years ago\nTook a funky idea and began to roll\nBy doing something that was never done\nWhile getting paid, still having fun\nBeing explicit straight from the streets\nNot forgettin' our roots to an up-tempo beat\nTaking what they say just for granted\nFor us to give up, that's what they wanted\nTo do it all, we'd be taking shorts\n'Cause at that time we were given no thought\nTo follow another; we didn't see it\nWe're the example for others to see\nIn the beginning all we had was a phone\nAnd trust in each other was how we lived on\nWord was bond, we relied on true\nFaith in each other backed up by Luke\n\n\nWe are\nGhetto Style\nPerched in the South\nThe king of the ghetto\nThe man, not a myth\n\n\nThe journey was long, but we fought the struggle\nWe paid off in the end by the bundles\nIn the beginning, some were against us\nBut we proved them wrong, and made them envious\nSo we kept on writing, the public kept on buying\nWhat we were making, they took a-likin'\nWe found the market, hit the target\nWe started the fire, but it's you who sparked it\nWe stayed independent, and we didn't sell out\nWe started off with no help from the White House\nThe plot was perfect, though we needed a gimmick\nSo we thought up this dance called Throw the Dizznick\nIn no time at all, things started growin'\nCharts were showin' that sales were soarin'\nThen all the talkin', all the squawkin',\nThey tried to take the name, but keep Skyy-walkin'\n\n\n\n\nA black thing, from beginning to end\nBrothers in the business and loyal friends\nSteppin' on stages, movin' as one\nFor the money and for the fun\nNo matter how it goes, how bad it seems,\nWhen once seem down, we all come clean\n\n\nIn unity, we all stand strong\nWe all step together,\nno man walks alone\nNo matter what, they can't stop us\nThey ain't doin' us just 'cause, when it's just us\nAny circumstance we must overcome\nLet's keep the dream alive, and all get some\nAnd never mind those people with the negative vibes\nAnd never mind the people with the evil eyes\n'Cause they all flippin' somewhere out on a trip\n'Cause they don't understand the man and the myth\n",
