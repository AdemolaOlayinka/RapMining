Jay, this young brother doesn't play\nHe'll strong-arm any sucker who gets in his way\nBaby Ced, Liberty City born and bred\nAlways known for the knowledge and sense of the head\nDisco Gene, he's reunited with the team\nHe was gone for a while, but back in the swing of things\nAmazing Chico, a king to his trade\nKnown as Bernie B. on 9-1-7 Bass\nAnd G.I. Joe, who has the girls by the row\nHe always gets cased 'cause his game is gettin' slow\nAnd last but not least, marvelous J.P.,\nAnd we can't forget Cisco - we're glad you are free\nSo one day to your kids you will tell the story\nOf how the Ghetto Style DJ's achieved their glory!\n\nGhetto\nBass\nLook out everybody, 'cause they're in the place,#\nIt's Luke Skyywalker and the Ghetto Bass!\n",
