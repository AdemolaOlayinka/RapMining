Da Drought 3
2007)
Uh, Umm, Weezy you all,
Young Money, Cash Money,
This is, Da Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemen, you all know me,
You know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas,
Most likely I'm gonna die with my finger on the trigger,
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes is so wide as he watching the skillet,
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'm gonna kill her,
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,
And fuck you, hospital, young money, we're the illest,
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest,
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,
Self made G, and them bitches know the business.
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was "The Gremlins"
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,
You looking for divine and the little intervention,
And them birds don't fly, without my permission,
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
See my world is different,
Like Dwayne Wade,
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing,
And you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
'Cause the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it
The sky is the limit,
Buck Ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it,
Switching lane faster than she switch subject,
Tell a bitch don't talk to me,
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me,
My flow is art, unique,
My flow can part a sea,
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
By any means, and you're just sardine,
I got the 40 cal. Tuck in my p.r.ps.,
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,
And majority of my city is violence,
They tried to make a brand new map without us,
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,
And I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
Cause the sky is the limit,
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa,
(that's fucked up, ha ha)
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
Mail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G,
And you ain't gotta know the alphabet to see,
I know that my whole city is depending on me,
And I forget a lot of shit, but I can not forget the streets,
So you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
'Cause the sky is the limit,
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit,
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
If you don't know nothing about it, the sky is the limit.
