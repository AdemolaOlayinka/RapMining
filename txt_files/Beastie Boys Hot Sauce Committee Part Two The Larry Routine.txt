Beastie Boys
Hot Sauce Committee Part Two
2011)
Oh, this routine dates way back
A lot of people may remember this routine
but it's evolved, now
Yeah from the summer before last
  
Well my names Mike D and I got a new name
And that new name is - LARRY!!

Well my name is Ad Rock, and then I got a new name
And my new name is - HARRY!!

Well my name is MCA, but I got a new name
And that new name is - GARY!!

But our DJ's name has stayed the same
Cause his new name is - BARRY!!
