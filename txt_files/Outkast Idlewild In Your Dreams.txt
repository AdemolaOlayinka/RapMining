The moon is on my sun, and my nights turn out my days 
Nocturnal creature by habit bruce wayne no what i mean

Mother fucker pow pow  better fuck down now, 
Now no, don't try to talk your way out because i'm usually
Non violent positivley vibing, but every now and then you got a 
Nigger wanna try you out

How you really post the hand in, pardon me one moment i just went
Off on a tangent ha ha ha ha

Done like dishes, this a rap like christmas
