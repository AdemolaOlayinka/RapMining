LL Cool J
The DEFinition
2004)
Wooh
And you say New York City (uhuh)
Back by popular demand (ah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya)
You been waitin’ in the bay for us so long baby
We had em starvin’
Ay yo E, the big homie


Star studded, my ear lobes is flooded
Dj’s wanna rub it, bootleggers wanna dub it
Easy does it
Ladies love it, cats with big budgets
We be gel two jets and Tar Smith luggage
Clowns talkin’ rubish and pretendin’ they thuggish
But I’m a young livin’ legend like Pee Wee at the Rucker’s (uhuh)
I was raised outta Queens
But rap kept me off of the cover of Fed’s magazine
Put me in a Gulf Stream
Your man done it, push the EX 100
And you don’t want it, I got the whole rap game cornered
Watch me flaunt it, damn right I’m iconic
Soon as Nix find an icy track I slide on it


I know there’s got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I’m about to get her
And I know there’s gotta some kind of chick up off in here that’s got the hots for me
I’m about to get her
See I know there’s got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I’m about to get her
I know there’s got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I’m about to get her


The beach front estate, mega yacht by the lake
The safe in the floor with a life time of cake
Wifey emailing, make my side vibrate
Cats can’t believe I’m still hot, I got em irate
The hip hop boss of the Empire State
Cats never front on me, they know I drive weight
He’s the best that ever did it, they call me Cool J
They platinum selling or, my skins turning gray 
Okay
They don’t know how to act
And my BDS was miles ago to Cali and back
Minimum
Private jets in the millennium
Plenty of Benjamin’s, hot ladies and gentleman (but I said) and 


I know there’s got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me
I’m about to get her
And I know there’s gotta some kind of chick up off in here that’s got the hots for me
I’m about to get her
See I know there’s got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I’m about to get her
I know there’s got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I’m about to get her


I know that it’s ridiculous for yall to picture this
The way I keep reein’ up, servin’ and flippin’ this
Dot the I’s cross the T’s meticulous
The coldest winter ever and I’m so icicle-ish
The movement is flavorful, bags of licorice
The drop, the rock, the watch, the necklace
There’s no forgettin’ this, the way that I’m reppin this
My bodyguard’s big but do that make me rebelish
I’m in the Hamptons, game stronger than Sampson
That’s why I’m still a teen pop idol like Hanson
Young black and handsome, movin’ with the cheddar
Bring honey to the V.I.P., I’m about to get her 
Let’s go


I know there’s got to be a fine honey with her hands up in this club for me

See I know there’s got to be one sassy little freak that wanna leave with me
I’m about to get her
I know there’s got to be a girl that wants to come to V.I.P. and drink with me
I’m about to get her
Uh, put your hands in the air
Yeah
Throw ya hands in the air
