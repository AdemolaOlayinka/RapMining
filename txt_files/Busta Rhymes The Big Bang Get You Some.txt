Money, cars, clothes, sexy broads, plenty more, go.. get you some
  Mansion, lots, planes, Phantoms, bitch you better...
 Go.. get you some
  Hustlin, jugglin, robbin, stealin shit, I gotta get this fuckin
 Money, cars, clothes, sexy broads, plenty more, go.. get you some
  Fortune, power, fame, passion for this shit you need to...
 Go.. get you some
  Don't stop, nigga we ain't done, gun it through your fuckin road block


I'm sayin who told y'all to let a muhfucker back on the block
with the bullshit, see y'all done fucked up now!
Turn the volume up and bang it out the trunk now!
You gotta problem son? Imagine how the club sound
Look and see I'm ready to spark it

See the way I comin through, and how I kick in the door
Watch how I coffee grind like never before.. the way I wreck from the door
So I mack wit' em, passin em, when I'm speakin
I'm preachin, all my niggaz out in EVERY HOOD!

And give you all the jewels in (this rhyme), and then I put it down to you all!
I can't get enough of it niggaz, I gotta ex-plore (many)
All of my options, I gotta get me plenty more...

You need to learn 'cause you ain't knowin the half, BITCH!
And while I'm gone I'm puttin dough in the stash, BITCH!
So new and fresh I say it again
So what it do, don't test see I'ma blaze to the end
I'm comin through, so confess you niggaz know who the kid
I'm like a newborn nigga, that's securing a win
(HOT!) So new and so current and they hate this
The streets'll classify in another level of greatness
I'm here to fix up the game, I'm givin it a facelift
New and improved, watch the way I make the game shift!
Now watch me swing it out the ballpark
I come to shut it down, don't let the war start while I come to get the...
