Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
Yeah,
Euro Nigga

I'm that Dominican nigga, yo bitch be talking bout'
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection, of my ho collection
Y-M-C-M-B no autocorrection
I said fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon respect my niggas
Either that or get a wack or get a bat to back of the neck my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all, with y'all cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town
Got a small circle, you'll never get around
Old hoes thinking I'mma put em on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'mma put em all down
Hoes been broke, who's rich now?
I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit
Til y'all heard me spit, 
Gotta mojo, with a flow-flow
Gotta whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no
Cooling in the cut with a  sipping romo
No love for the po-po's, gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'mma need a little more dope for my uncle
Cause I sell flows and he sell dope
Nigga work
God Euro
What up this Mack The fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my nigga
Predicting futures
You need some lottery numbers holla at me nigga I got you

Put a nigga in that hearse,Long ass K no nino
Word to Martin I'm cole but just call me buck shots
Like Pam make a nigga say "Damn Gina"
Millzy! money don't mean nothing, my youngin'
Will kill you for some sneakers (blah)
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime
We in the endzone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried bout nothin, nothin
Nigga act dumb, push the buttonm, fuck em
Get'em out of here like the sixth foul in the NBA, little nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case, like judge Millz Lane
All y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the should dog
My team strapped, no overalls.
So please don't make me do it
Got soldiers and shooters
These bullets will swallow
Like shots of khalua
When we light up the weed
We fly like a rumor
Then hop on the plane
And fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war then all we coming after you
Especially if I'm smashin your sister like 
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger
Hittin your girl then I'm passing her
Jae Millz ain't worried bout nothin
Young Money ain't worried bout nothin
D5!
We ain't worried bout nothin (Young Money)
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin (not a thing)
Nigga we ain't worried bout nothin
