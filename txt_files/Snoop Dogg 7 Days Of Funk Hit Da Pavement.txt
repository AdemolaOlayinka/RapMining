Snoop Dogg
7 Days Of Funk
2013
Yeah.. so funky..

Niggaz hit the pavement, when I come thru slow
in a six-fo', hangin out the window
Niggaz hit the pavement, when I fall thru the club
Chuckin up the dub on you scrubs
Niggaz hit the pavemment, D-F on the beat
If you don't work, then you don't eat
Niggaz hit the pavement, real true statement
Grind 'til they pay me, real niggaz hit the pavemennt

I'm in the coke white BM
Just clocked in at 11 p.m.
Uh, while I'm blowin my meds
Most of y'all niggaz prob'ly goin to bed
I'm out in the red, comin back home with the bread
Handle my medal, Hansel & Gretel
Cheese, keys, breeze, and settle
This shit hot like a pot or a kettle


Droppin Cs' for the Gs, poppin my Ps'
Dottin my Is' while crossin my Ts'
Me and Dam spittin game, doin shows overseas
40 years old, have no fuckin enemies
Check cheddar, ber-etta let 'em mo' wetter
If you knew better then you'll prol'ly do better
Act like you know, know not better know better
Cause..


I live with a maid
Won't be happy 'til my whole team paid
From my momma to my daddy to my kids to my wife
And all my kinfolks in the afterlife
I'm chillin on the moon like Mac Tonight
Bigg Snoop Dogg got 'em actin like
Money is the key to end all your woes
Mo' money, mo' hoes


Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
Keep mashin with this funk y'all, keep mashin
(Niggaz hit the pavement)
