For the love of money
For the love of money
For the love of money
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne

Say what's up to the broke nigga at the rich party
Who the fuck let this nigga in?
Do I look like I give a fuck? Sorry
Looking at these hoes and they gold digger gorgeous tryna get me
I run game on a bitch, one Mississippi two Mississippi
Flint nigga in the spot til they pop one and the cops come like (woo!)
Motherfuckers own a shotgun like a pop gun and they ready like yeah
Still a good nigga I'm a Northside nigga til I'm gone
Do it for the ones in the hood like Connor gon' put the city on
Fuck that shit nigga, fuck that shit go
Live for my hood, look this for my block
Ride for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac
I ain't got shit but I still feel good
Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got
Go hard in the paint, you can tell em post up
Homie in the hood like "let me hold something"
Your mans in the hood talking all that shit
When they ran up on him lil buddy froze up
All they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing
Niggas be talking that ain't what they want
Ain't no fake shit around here
Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck
I be killing this and not giving a fuck
You laugh at a bitch, she get hid in the trunk
You think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up
So this for my people that's still in the cut

I said I want that, need that
The root of all evil mayne, (get it, get it)
I said I want that, need that
The root of all evil, mayne

Said what's up to the nigga wearing all black at a white party
And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck
That's how I get down nigga sorry
And I'm looking like I don't play no games, nah, nigga don't try me
Been that nigga that's been spitting that
Paid dues like a motherfucking hobby
If you're on that bullshit nigga better fly that shit right by me
I came from the bottom of this bitch and made it out of that shit
And that's why we on top of this motherfucking world
Damn, look at that body
She come along with the territories
Turn around, move it for me, bend it over, end of story
(Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you)
Got a relationship with that money
(But that bitch will never be faithful to you)
Even though I know she knows she crazy
(Please just let it go, seize, no saving you)
Ride, ride
Til the motherfucking wheels fall off in this bitch
(We can do it for the love)
But I'm never stopping my poppin'
(These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial
It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to)

Want that, need that
Root of all evil, mayne
I said I want that, need that
Root of all evil, mayne

It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mayne

Want that, need that
The root of all evil mayne, get it, get it
I said I want that, need that
