The Drought Is Over 2 (Carter 3 Sessions)
2007)
Let's Talk it over now
Let's talk it over now


Knew I would love you like a fat kid love food
Knew I would score on you like Shaq did in school
Knew I was stupid, Knew I looked like a big fool
I must of had the flu, I thought the shit was cool
Knew you would fall in love with me and the shit I do
But never knew you would murder me, what did I do
Knew you was right for me, knew I was right for you
Knew I would help you sell, knew I would write for you
Knew I would keep you well, knew I would fight for you
Knew I would pull my heart out and bring it right to you
You knew all about me baby, but you wasn't about me baby
Young Wayne, prepare for change
Because it seem like girly don't care the same
You had my chain, you beared my name, the we had champagne


Let's take a toast, to you and me
Let's drink a toast to honor the way its supposed to be 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh


Other people telling me I fell off
Other people telling me I felt y'all
Momma telling me I should have at least called
My mind telling me she should have at least call
Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-saw
Felt like I was at the bottom of the sea-shore
But you got to let her be bored
And when you open up your eyes I hope you see more
And when I see you, I see a detour
Don't need to be depressed anymore
Baby girl I need more, now run your mouth until your knees sore


Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over Noooooooow 

Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over Noooooooow 

Let's talk it over 
Let's talk it over


5 karats on her finger got her hand smitten
But everybody get a ring even Scotty Pippin 
Everybody got a thing but I guess mine isn't 
What my vision 
Soo I just sit in my Lamborghini let my top vibe with me 
Kick back and get high with me 
And if she still get me 
I hope my wife know she got a player for life and that's no bullshiting 
I push love to it's full limit 
Do a hundred-ninety in the lane called memory 
And I know you in that lane with me 
But when the light change 
You didn't change with it 
And now im honking my horn 
got to get that dead grass off of my lawn 
As I mow's on, the chanpagne's never Froze-on 
As it pours on the floor


Let's take a toast, to you and me
Let's drink a toast to honor the way its supposed to be 
Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
