Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
‘Cause when them boys in my shooting
They I’m missing on a dark play
‘Cause when you at them and tell them
And the gun fill them belly
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for
The euphoria, the euphoria
Shoot 
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
You gonna have to jump on it
You gonna have to lift it
You gonna have to jump on it
You gonna have to lift it
You gonna have to jump on it
You gonna have to lift it
You gonna have to jump on it
You gonna have to lift it
‘Cause when you at them and tell them
And the gun fill them belly
And grown enough so you can be the last living crew for
The euphoria , the euphoria
Shoot 
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
Gotta get away
Gotta get away
To a place I love
To a place I love
