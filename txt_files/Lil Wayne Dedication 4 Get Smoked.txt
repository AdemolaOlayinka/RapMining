Dedication 4
with DJ DRAMA)
09, we tote; my niggas ain’t no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

uh.
I’m rollin, all my niggas rollin,
Keep that fuckin red bandana, Hulk Hogan
I’m cuttin up like scissors
Comin down hard like blizzards
I’m getting head while giving head that’s a head on collision
I’m on a pain pill
I keep this shit trill
These niggas ain’t forreal, Like a fire drill
Your hoe on my back, like a fuckin 5th wheel
that bitch make her pussy open and close like fish gills
I put all my niggas on, but some of them niggas gone
Them niggas callin my phone, leave me alone
I’m lightin up that strong, then pass it to my bro
Numbers don’t lie, except 5-0
Different color Trukfit shirts
You niggas pull down your skirts
If I die of these purp, put a bad bitch in my hearse
My hoes lift up they shirts, I’m high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work, we Rob like Burke.
ugh

09, we tote; my niggas ain’t no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

Corlay RIP him, Darnell RIP him
If you disrespect them, then you gone meet them
My niggas rollin for for features; that bitch going, she a eater
She was a good girl, I turned her to a eater
Hit squad , yea nigga
.30 clip and them hollow tips make him do the running man
Glock 40 I’m tuckin it; I’m rolling with my hitters
I’ll send my hitters out to go get you
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Hella bands, hella bands, hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load, throwing hella bands, in the club doing the money dance
Niggas talking shit in the club, he better watch his self
Melly got the .30 on his hip, he gone need some help
I’m a gangster, nigga, and I could do this shit my fucking self
Pistol hit his melon; it ain’t gone be nothing left

09, we tote; my niggas ain’t no joke
And we keep them blows, so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuck-arounds, and you fuck around and get smoked

Runnin around with my gangstas, Runnin up in these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna fuck my bitch, her pussy lips like heaven doors
It’s pussy, money, and kush,
Skateboards and shrooms
These niggas think they the shit,
these niggas perfume
Hollygrove, so Hollygrove, all I know is Hollygrove
I’m sick with it, I’ve been diagnosed
We don’t cut the coke, that’s diet coke
These niggas broke, I’m paid in full
Blood gang, Red Bull
My tounge is like a surf board, and her pussy is like a wave pool
Tunechi!
