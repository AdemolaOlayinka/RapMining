Outkast
Idlewild
2006)
Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
Ridin' in the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up

Sharp as a tack like I just left church (clean)
Smart than a tack when the windows won't work (mean)
Ridin' in the Cadillac Beatin' like some beat it up 
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up

And everybody wanna know whus really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
So on and so on
I can o-on and o-on
and on,and on,and on
Hell yes!


Music make the world go round
Where it goes (where it goes)
Ya' just don't know (ya just don't know)
My heart is like a marching band 
Im a fan in the stands
Yes I am and Im hollerin' hey baby
Sayin hey baby

So baby please dont leave me
Dont you go (dont you go)
Baby no, no, no (baby no, no, no)
My heart is like a marching band 
Im a fan in the stands
Yes I am and Im hollerin' hey baby
Sayin hey baby

Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast...the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall
Shut'er down, time to go!
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still thats fire
Hot like teh perm on the back of ya neck
Left it in too long
Now ya got Cabbage Patch Silky
Ridin' the Cadillac
Beatin' like some beatit up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast cmae to heat it up

Bendin' corners like a crowbar, oh so unique
got the pedal to floor, but the 4 door just creeps

Ridin' in the Cadillac 
Beatin like some beat it up
The game dun' changed Out-
Kast came to heat it up

Exotic, melodic melody jep, we got it
Funkin for the funk of it and everybody want it

(ROOF) you make it make it put a dog on it
(ROOF) you make it make it put a dog on it



Im tippin my hat off to ya baby
Cuz youre so fine, blow my mind
I put in the time
Everybody knows you cant let the pretty one past ya by
without sayin' hi

Im so gone over you
Yes it's true 
Baby do whatcha you do
My nose is open wide (so wide, yeah)
Lookin' at you such a pretty sight (so wide, yeah)
My heart on my sleeve (my sleeve, yeah)
And this is how it sounds to me (this is how it sounds to me)



Baby you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and my band
We bringin' the church back to ya feet
So wait baby
Dont leave me, baby
Say wait,baby
Dont leave me, baby
