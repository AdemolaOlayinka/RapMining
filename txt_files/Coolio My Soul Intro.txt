Coolio
My Soul
1997)
A man is heard running and breathing fast
 Damn!  Wha...

The running gets faster, the man is breathing faster, and he sounds 
terrified. The devil's laughing is getting much louder

There is the sound of things being knocked over as if the man is trying 
to hide and everything is in his way

 What you want man? What you want from me?

 Your soul!
