Run-D.M.C.
King Of Rock
1985)
Well I rehearsed for the verse and I'm number one
Not the best, not the worst, cause my name is Run
	And I'm second cause I wreck it, that you want to see
An emcee (like D) inside the place (to be)
	And have you heard that he is third and his name is Jay
	I'm Run the A
	D the Deuce
	and Jay's the Tre'




I'm the rapper of the year and this the year of the rap
And I'm never drinkin beer, it's champagne at the tap
And I'm cold makin money on a regular basis
Pullin out, knockin sucker MC faces
Travel round the world with my mind at ease
No Calvin Klein, just wearin Lee's
Got credit in countries I've never been
cause the records I write are in the top ten
The top of the chart, is where I stay
but I also chill, around the way
In Hollis, Queeens, is where I stop
On the streets with the beats is where I walk


When I perform, many hearts I warm
I'm better known, as the Quiet Storm
I don't talk too much but I got beef
When I kill MC's, I cause grief
Devestating mic control is my main goal
My name is Darryl, and his name is (Joe)
The Master of music his name is Jay
Leave us alone, and let us play
We give it up, and turn it loose
We're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MC's like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours, WE WENT FOR OURS!



	Start at 3, end at 6
Jam Master Jay is on the mix
	For all the young ladies
	and all the chicks
	We got all of the girls
	on our tips
	Don't buy gold lighters
	only Bic's
	Rock all microphones
	just for kicks


Sucker MC's I will be snuffin
In my pocket I'll keep on stuffin
When I say I'll beat em up I won't be bluffin
They can't beef cause that ain't nothin
But it don't matter, my pocket gets fatter
I got more hats than the Mad Hatter


Well I'm the rapper with the mic, drive a Caddy not a bike
Drop a rhyme in your face, and you'll damn sure like
He's an MC with the rhyme know the day and the time
Never ever goin low, cause he only climb
(And Jay's the DJ with the) cut (move your arm) and your butt
So D take the mic, huh hah


Say what?  I will not stop, I will not quit
Because some at the top but I'm on the tip
That's as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe, I'll be on it
So before you decide, to try me out
I'm gonna let you all know what I'm all about
I'm a fresh MC, who's on his way
to be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there, that don't know me
I go by the name of D. M. C.
In the place to be, I will MC
The Master of the Ceremony cause it's easy to D
Control of the mic, is so devestating
that all other rappers you will soon be hating
No matter what race, creed or color
when we pull forward things don't get duller!
