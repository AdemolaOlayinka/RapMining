Uhh Yeahh Uh Ohh Yeahh
Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men?
He-hey hey Barbie! I can be your black Ken
Wow! Cause' once you go black, you never go back
She wore my hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat and after that
Everything went black!

Baby 1, 2, 3
Tell'em get the referee
Cause he can
Get the knockout
If the telephone rings
It's an emergency
Cause he can
Get the knockout
Get the knockout

Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Haha
Hey Barbie, can I call you tomorrow and today?
Cause' once you go black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
She threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat and after that
Everything went black!


Awe fuck it
Give me that damn bucket
Wh-when I throw this pussy
You better not start duckin
Oh yo
Hit him with the blow
Lo-look out in the crowd
And everybody's yellin' "No!"
Grab him by his locks
And give him some good box
Then hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
Top, top
Give him good top
hit him below the belt
I wanna give him good top
1, 2, 3
They yellin 1, 2, 3
I done hit him with that motherfuckin court two piece
Tell'em, tell'em the mouth out
To late to cop out
Give him more head than toothpaste like I locked out


So just knock me out
So just knock me out
Yea
Just knock me out
So just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
Just knock me out
