In the kitchen with the pots yeah work the glass
Hard on 'em pimp yeah I work the task
And when they came in we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unrapped 'em all
Just two words nigga duffelbags I just know it so well

And just your luck the rap game got me hold up

Bag money all on timbs, and that bad bitch is all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine I'm so far in I'm speaking with an accent
Just cartwin, can't even relax in my room,
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my niggas getting brown paper bag money

Miami Khaled took me in like a orphan
Why did they start him?
Now they can't park him

To streets my brother

Brown paper bag (we are simply the BEST the VERY BEST)

You all niggas want coka music
The costra nostra flow show you how to do this
Pen it so easy, a caveman can do it
Nigga we simply the best don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet but give me the same rating

Etched in stone runt top puns war
Unsure anythings possible
