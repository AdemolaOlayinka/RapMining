Busta Rhymes
When Disaster Strikes
1997)
All my niggas dirty
Hungry and thirsty
Hitcha like 30 30 for watcha worst see
Ya know we got to get this money
Survival hungry



A yo ooh baby
What I feel is just, ha
The type of shit that make you act stupid for real, but a
Ya'll, before ya try to wear these you need to hear these
Welcome all ya'll to my world series 
Ya ya ya
Elaborate on Busta Rhymes theories
Ya ya ya 
I could bust your ass from half a ball Mcs
Ya ya ya
Never disrespect these monumental creating new flow
The full blast we'll hit'em hit'em hit'em high hit'em low
And while your style will soften, then my mind will drift often
To illusions of my lyrics given you massages in the coffin
The boom shock ooh wee
Horny nigga crash into a motherfuckin tree
I visualize shit and we in the place to be
Extra strength nigga bett's ta mind the party 
Full fears I just pierce of in the place
Make the spot look scarce and peruse
Needles in ya face
Fuck dumb shit straight up
Keep it bouncin baby make sure you hold your wait up 
A ha 
Yea, just watch how the flow will change up for sure
Rippin until my niggas walk out the door





Ya'll, I refuse  to lose 
Look at the news and read the interviews
Flipmode is da squad 
A unit made of many crews 
Give me the whole entire wheel of fortune
Makin a sacrifice no matter what the shit be coustin
And while you coughing I be flawsine like a fuckin dolphin
A lot of bitch rich niggas expernce extortion
This hours born when I'ma form
I drop a million in a one stony rocks on niggas like a fuckin hailstorm
I pulnternal my new flow
Put on your funeral home suit
And exacuted with a bang shoop
The blow torch been ignited
Those who seem exited, ha   
I'ma bout ? bunch of bitch niggas and they extradited
You soundin so sloppy
Like a broken muffler draggin behind an older lobby
Once the bomb drops here's to aftermath 
Scientist tried to disscet my way and formulate my craft
Worrying bout how I achieve things
The way I antilze shit and how I proceed things
My style is real like bear skin imported from the Pursuance
Follow my excoriation all the way till you feelin the newer vibe version
I complete the after feat
Destroy who ever complicate the way how I eat
Survival hungry nigga
