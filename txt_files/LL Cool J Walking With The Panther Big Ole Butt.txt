Walking With The Panther
1989)
I was at the mall, sippin' on a milkshake
Playin' the wall, takin' a break
Admirin' the girls with the bamboo earings
Baby hair and bodies built to swing
That's when I seen her
Her name was Tina
Grace and poise kinda like a ballerina
I said, "How you doin', my name's Big L
Don't ask me how I'm livin', 'cause, yo, I'm living swell
But then again I'm livin' kind of foul
'Cause my girl don't know that I'm out on the prowl"
To make a long story short, I got the digits
Calls her on my car phone and paid her a visit
I was spankin' her and thankin' her, chewin' her and doin' her
Layin' like a king on sheets of satin
That's what time it is, you know what's happenin'
She had a big ole booty, I was doin' my duty
I mean, yo, I admit that my girl's a cutie
But Tina was erotic, Earl's my witness
With the kind of legs that put stockings out of business
When I went home, I kissed my girl on the cheek
But in the back of my mind it was this big butt freak
I sat my girl down, I couldn't hold it in
And said to her with a devilish grin...

TINA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But TINA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
TINA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But TINA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you

I went to the high school about three o'clock
To try to catch a cutie ridin' my jock
My homeboy's jeep, the system blastin'
Cold forty dogs, smilin' and laughin'
Girls all over, the kind I adore
I felt like a kid in a candy store
That's when I seen her
Her name was Brenda
She had the kind of booty that I'd always remember
I said to my man, "Stop the jeep"
She's only senteen but, yo, don't sleep
I kicked the bass like an NFL punter
And scoped the booty like a big game hunter
I said to the girl, "Yo, you look tired
Let's go get some rest, relax by the fire"
I put the big booty on a bearskin rug
She gave me a kiss, I have her a hug
I said to the girl, "them young boys ain't nothin'
You want to get freaky, let me kiss your belly button"
I circled it and teased it and made her squeal
Grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
When I was through, I wiped the sweat from my eyes
When to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
Tina busted in my house while I was eatin'
You know what I said
Too bad you caught me cheatin', but...

BRENDA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But BRENDA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
BRENDA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But BRENDA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you

I went to Red Lobster for shrimp and steak
Around the time whe the waitress are on their lunch break
I pulled in the parkin' lot and parded my car
Somebody shouted out, "I don't care who you are"
I paid it no attention, I walked inside
Because Brian had a nine and he was chillin' in the ride
I walked in the place, everybody was lookin'
And shrimp and steak wasn't the only thing cookin'
I sat down to eat, ordered my food
I said to the waitress, "I don't men to be rude
But I'll take you on a platter"
She said, "You got a girl," I said, "It don't matter
You look like you're tastier than a pipin' hot pizza
What's your name?" She said, "My tag says Lisa"
I said, "O.K., you're smart and all that
But when you get off work, yo, I'll be back"
She looked at me and said, "Make yourself clear
L, where we going?" I said, "Right here"
She looked kind of puzzled, I said, "You'll see"
I pulled up at ten on the D.O.T.
When she walked out the door, I threw my tongue down her throat
Pushed her back inside and pulled off her coat
Laid her on the table and place my order
And habe her a tip much bigger than a quarter
On and on to the break 'a dawn
All over the restaurant, word is born
I heard somebody coughin', I checked my watch
I couldn't believe it said nine o'clock
I grabbed my pants, put on my Kangol
Who did I see, Oh, yo, it was Brenda
Yo, she worked at Red Lobster but I didn't remember

LISA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But LISA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya
LISA got a big ole butt
I know I told you I'd be true
But LISA got a big ole butt
So I'm leavin' you
See ya
