I Am The West
2010)
This world so trife
Your money or your life
Yeah, keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life (give it up)
This world so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (West Coast)
Yeah, keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life

I got that gangbang mentality movie after movie
I can't get it outta me, who wanna battle me?
Mouths a Uzi thumbtack your ass to the concrete
Treat you like a fuzi
This pyroclastic flow that I lay
Will turn this fucking boof into pompai
Now what will I do in broad day
Turn Broadway into a hallway
Motherfuckers wanna know the hurbs and spices
They come to me and wanna know what my advice is
I'm spiritual nigga like Jesus Christ is
And lyrical bitch I'm about the nicest
I'm content long jibbily
Plus I spit shit that sit on your brain heavily
I could do this shit 'til I'm 70
On the Vegas strip yeah that's where I be
This world (this world) so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life (give it up)
This world, so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (you know)
Yea keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life

Now I get that money, make that cheddar
Play a double header, we can do better
You can get wetter, blown out your sweater
So much game need dick buy better
Now Helen and Kellar can read this letter
23 word if you read out for better
I'm a go getter you's a point setter
Pointing at me like you got a vendetta
Boy, you know better
They used to call me cube the impaler
Ask Jerry Heller
You the kind of fella that look for Cinderella
I'm the kind of fella that steal her umbrella
Now this ain't a diss, so don't tell Rockafella
And don't try to exorcise the ghost of Makivella
But I just got to be the best storyteller
A tough Slick Rick win with the soccerfella
This world (ask trella) so trife
Your money or your life (grand wizard)
Keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
This world so trife (so trife)
Your money or your life (gotta have it)
Yea keep your kids, keep your wife
Money or your life
