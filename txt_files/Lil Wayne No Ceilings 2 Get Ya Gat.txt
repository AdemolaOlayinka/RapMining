Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas
Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
I went from rich man, nigga, straight to henchman, nigga
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
Too all you rich-ass niggas, all you rich-ass niggas
Kickin' back, gettin' fat, gettin' tats
And to your fuckboy posse with their tough boy postures
It's an act, they ain't never got your back
Gettin' jacked, you ain't never gettin' it back
You gettin' wacked, you ain't never comin' back
And cut 'em slack, we ain't never done 'em that
No, we ain't never done 'em that
And we don't go tit for tat, we just blat
Now he's exposed, when we snap, picture that
He decomposed, he small like cat in the trap
Oh, I go psycho, I go rhino, I know his recital
My whole fuckin' bio, I'mm K-I-L-L-E-R no typo
I'm a dino, I'm the kind of nigga that don't give a flying fuck
About another clique but us
Who fly as us? We flyin' up
Who wanna fuck with us? Who signin' up?
Cause I know my clique tough as tusks on a hippopotamus
I know Ii'mma sip that stuff
I can't say that this is not a must
I must say this shit kinda tough
But fuck it, nigga, bottom's up, pause
I got some time to fuck so I'mma hit little mama up
And I got millions to blow and I got Milian to plush
I got millions of .44's and I got military guns
And these bitches 'bout to go pop, pop, pop, like January 1
Got some bitches on the floor and when I piss, they drink it up
I'mma shit on everyone and, that shit gon' feel like kingdom come
Told my bitch that she don't want that bitch, I’m still Miss Cita’s son
And I'm triple OG, my own girl own a gun

Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'
Then we strapped with the gat in all black
So where you at, where you at, where you at?
Yeah, where they at, where they at, where they at?
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat

Yeah, get the gat, get the gat, get the gat
When you a rich little nigga, plus some niggas plot to jack
Where they at, where they at, where they at?
Bitch tryna take mine, I'm sendin' bullets through ya back
I'm a G, I'm a G, I'm a G
Copped the coupe and the wheels, first day I hit the streets
I match the rags with the mags and the seats
And I be saucin' on these niggas so it all match my sneaks
Damn, you know how east niggas do shit
40 on my left, I'mma ride a new bitch
Yesterday hoe was trippin' so she gotta go
One thing about pimpin', man, motherfuck a hoe
Me and Hoody talkin' cocaine
For the slippers outta niggas who want whole thangs
Oh man, feel the trigger, make it go bang
So keep a gat and if they ask we don't know names

Get a gat, get a gat, get a gat
To all you rich-ass niggas, and you bitch-ass niggas
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat
And tell your fuckboy posse, while you stuntin' we be mobbin'
Then we strapped with the gat in all black
So where you at, where you at, where you at?
Yeah, where they at, where they at, where they at?
Get ya gat, get ya gat, get ya gat

All this white powder, screaming, "white power"
Young Money, bad boys, fat Mike Lowry
Wow, I might shoot up your Ferrari, nigga
Oh, tell your passenger I'm sorry, nigga
My young niggas screaming, "put me in the game, coach"
Chopper bullets rain, you gon' need a raincoat
My little homie, he got stripes like a bengal
I got a nephew named Killer, he an angel
Get money, stay real, that's the game plan
I got a bad bitch and all she do is gangbang
My college hoe on the low, she do the same thing
I got a stripper with a gat and a fat cat
Breakin' niggas off, all my homies call her Kit-Kat
Yeah, she let you hit that, bet she bring your shit back
Sleepin' with them hoes, get you tied up and kidnapped
Killers at your door, nigga, knock knock, click clack
Get ya get, get ya get, get ya get
And load it up, load it up, load it up
Where your fuckboy posse, where they at?
Niggas fuck, niggas fuck, niggas fuck
Yeah, shake that ass hoe, shake, shake
Shake that ass hoe, shake, shake
Shake that ass hoe, shake, shake
Shake that ass hoe, shake, shake
Shake-shka-shake-shka-shake shake that ass
Shake-shka-shake-shka-shake shake that ass
Say dicksuckin' hoe, nutsuckin' hoe
Hoes, hoes, ain't nothin' but hoes
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't nothin' but a dopeman bitch
You ain't got no job, know you wanna be a trick
But I'm a nigga with a rock hard bone
And I'm takin' one of these hoes home, yeah
But I'm a nigga with a rock hard bone
And I'm takin' one of these hoes home, yeah
