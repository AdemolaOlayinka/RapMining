The other thing is this I want you to learn.
I want you to go around all over these streets and make yourself a protector.
You go in and you make sure these guys are all safe okay, you order them an order of protection, for a small nominal fee.
And that's the way you do it, you walk in and you tell 'em,
"Hey, you know we're going to take care of your business but you got to pay us X amount of dollars per week." So you collect from them, you bring it to us,
we give you your peice and your end of the money for your family, and then you go up and up and up the pole.
