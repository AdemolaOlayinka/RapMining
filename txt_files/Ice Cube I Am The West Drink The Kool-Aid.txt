I Am The West
2010)
This ain't Sinatra! - This ain't the Carter!
I am the "chaperone" nigga - who brought ya!
I am the author! - This is Holy water!
From the Holy Father - the Rock of - Gibraltar!
Step up to the alter! - Step up to the slaughter!
Get circumsized son and turned into a daughter!
Niggas know they oughta - drink the fuckin' kool aid!
Industy laid out authorities are too late!
MC's passed the due date! - Niggas? - They do hate!
You are Bobby Boucher, I'm the "Mane" like "Gucci"!
I rock the Louie! - But not like Kanye!
Nigga see me kinda like - Harry Belafonte!
Step into the room they be like: "Ah, Day-O!"
Yeah, cause they know - a nigga ain't play-doe!
Shots all fatal! - Is this Laredo?
Boarder town knock'em down just like Lego's!
Drink the kool aid!
I make mothafucka drink-drink the kool aid!

I ain't the Doctor! - This ain't the patient!
This ain't that nigga always on vacation!
This ain't no white boy's rehabilitation!
This is crazier - then a boat full of Haitians!
This is inflation mixed with degradation!
This ain't no dead rappers reincarnation!
I heard it was a "New WestCoast", I ain't worried!
I murder more stars then Conrad Murray!
I got more bars then the penitentary!
I wrote this shit without a rhyme dictionary!
Young bucks try to step up - to the harim!
Looking for some pussy I'm a' old buck, I dare 'em!
