Want can make a nigga wanna take another nigga life
What can make a nigga wanna do another nigga wife
Life a butter knife
What can make a nigga wanna get his body so high
That can't go to sleep, don't wanna eat
Pray to God that he don't do crack
What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate imitate seesaws
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp simply 'cause he don't like love
What can make a nigga wanna achy, break all rules
In a book when it took a lot to get you hooked up to this volume
What can make a nigga wanna loose all faith in 
Anything that he can't feel through his chest wit sensation
