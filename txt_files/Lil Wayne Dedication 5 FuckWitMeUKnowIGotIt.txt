Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
I mean it's simple
Can't fuck with us

I got money on yo head
I don't do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don't even touch the work
I pray these niggas don't fuck with me
And I don't like to curse in church
And my girl' pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth's
I mean that, believe that
Don't be short with that work nigga
We find out where yo ho work nigga
We follow you moms from church nigga
You gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher
Get'em Tune
I don't really fuck around with certain niggas
Fuck all ya'll niggas, except my niggas
These niggas hustling backwards
Check ya rear-view mirror and side mirrors
OG kush keep my mind clearer
That choppa get yo mind right
I got 2 choppas that's chopsticks
Eat yo block up like shrimp fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white
You know I smoke like dry ice
Now there stay in yo lane and get sideswiped
It's going down, let me straighten up yo fly right
Still can't turn a ho into a housewife
Man it's like some things will never change
You ain't got a shot in a gun range
These chumps ain't even got chump change
Uh yea, and don't fuck with me, you know I'm Gotti
Check yourself before I sign it
Yea, I'm shinin on these niggas, no horizon
Yea, and it's going down if I'm her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided
Money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profile and rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like dub Mojave
I get my work from Rico Suave uh
It's a Rollie if I got time on my hand
You ever see me broke? Write on my cast
Boy my weed so good I cry when it's gone
Had a phone in jail, that's a cellphone
Yea, I'm bout to buy a machinegun
You drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I'm sittin on some train tracks
Hopin' that bitch speed up
I'm Strongarm and these niggas roll my sleeves up, yea
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized
When we in a hospital room full of flat lines
I'm Tunechi the immortal
My name ringing, my name ringin, hello may I take yo order?
I say...
Testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili nigga,
Ain't nothing free round here but Willy, nigga
Ak-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas blood, fuck yo syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner
Dedication

Hey let me introduce you nigga to America most
Every nigga round when we carry it out
Sedated bitches like a nigga tune the low
They just be like 10 and we doin em all
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin over the boat
I'm on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you nigga make a year I could do it to blow
You keep on playin with me, bet I'll put a few in you ho
The fate up before a nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean really like cartoon to me
Ain't nobody fuckin with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green and grab a truck
Young Money, cash money, they down with her
I got a bitch who want yo bitch, you finna get a ho up
And don't bullshit and listen, you don't really know her
We a bust a nigga head, leave layin fo dead
I get caught with a banger, I'm a lay in the feds
In Gen Park nigga every day interfere
I was chillin on the yard, really going hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King pussy nigga go up really like a God
A town nigga, bank head I'm about it
Everybody know "don't fuck with me cause I got it"
