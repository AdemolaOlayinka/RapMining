Lil Wayne
Tha Carter II
2005)
Yea, yea, yea
Weezy baby y'all, don't get shot
Rappin' fire, what you know about it
I brought my homie along for the ride
He strapped, he came here to come out the barrel


I heard some shouts like "Down on the floor"
Then even louder we got shooters, shooter
I turn around, I was starin' at chrome
Shotgun watches door, got security good
Jumped right over counter
Pointed gun at, wink, he tell her
I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, shooter 


I think they want me to surrender
But no, I can't do it 

So many doubt 'cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out
Bang! Die bitch nigga die I hope you bleed a lake
I'ma play x-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake
I'm just tryin' to be the great, tryin' to get a piece of cake
Take it offa your plate, eat it right in your face
They got a whole lot to say but I don't listen
Call me automatic Weezy bitch I keep spittin', pow


With all these riches and, all these riches
But ain't no loaners around
They thinkin about shooters that-shooters that
Guns-Girls-Ladies that-Gunners that
Shoot shoot shoot shoot shooter

Put my hands up
They want me with my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, shooter


But I'm not
I just cry mama, I think they, hey
Me think they want me to surrender (Shooter)

And to the radio stations, I'm tired o' being patient
Stop bein' rapper racists, region haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers
It's outrageous, you don't know how sick you make us
I want to throw up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern face it
If we too simple then y'all don't get the basics


Lady walks into a shotgun surprise
Dropped to her knees saw her life before her eyes
He said "Bitch is gonna get it", everybody gon regret it
I'm your, shooter

My hands up, my hands up
They want me with my hands up
Oh, Shooter 


Me won't surrender, me no pretender

Sock soakin' wet I been runnin' y'all
I reload, every hundred yards I'm comin' forward
Better know me, Lil Wayne just call me lord
Hard, take pain like Tylenols, raw
Way past par, for, I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout baby win lose or draw
And then they ask who when where how
And, my reply was simply pow!

Mama, I think they, hey, me think they want me to surrender
(Shooter, my hands up, my hands up, they want me to surrender) 

No, me won't surrender, no, no
I promise no surrender
I got my burner
And I'm your shooter
