Guess who's back, it ain't a fuckin' question
They know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend
Fuck what you heard it's murda, murda, you gon' need protection
Some niggas blinded, couldn't see, so look for me to come and give direction
Who hold the crown, it ain't no conversation
I'm bein' modest, should be silent 'less you payin' homage, remain the hottest
Niggas can't stop us, that's just being honest
And makin' hits, I never had problems much in that department
Don't get me started, don't compare me to the newest nigga
For everyone of you, there's a hundred more and I watch them come n' go
My track record ain't coincidental
And these verses is like hearses consistently killin' all with instrumentals
Tell me, fuck what would ya'll do without me?!
Kill yourself or even think of something crazy 'bout me
I'm like Ali a fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope
Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke

I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hired
Don't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
And never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try
Now that weak shit will never slide, I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys

Look, what the fuck, I was just chillin' in the cut
And no beginners, only winners run amok, you runners up
You funny fuck like twenty bucks, I know your slut will let me fuck
I told my city "Hold me down", now look how high they hold me up
I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts till I was old enough to cuss
Was kissin' bitches after lunch, now that's a muthafuckin' rush
So by highschool, I was fuckin' niggas bitches on the hush
So no questions and no panties in a muthafuckin' must
It's the peoples rapper, I ain't no rapper
I'm the rapture on the mornin' after
You lackin' passion, you ain't bad, you just a wack distraction
I can't relax cause I feel the magic smashin', Toni Braxton
Where your sisters at? Let's get it crackin' (fuckers)
Look, I was young, I was broke
Had no hope, so I wrote, that's how I cope
I went hard with no results
New approach, same truth
Just get ready, aim, shoot, then get buried, bang, woof
So they better bring troops because...

I came here to raise hell, I can't lie
One shot, one kill, it's real, I ain't hired
You won't shoot one shot if you ain't ready to die
Never get it fucked up, I got shooters for hire
Cause you don't want it, I have you like aye aye
Better back the fuck up, over guns so I try
Now that weak shit, we'll never slide, I despise
You are now not in the presence of nice guys

It's fuckin' murder, baby
I'm tryna hurt 'em, baby
I know you heard me, baby
Feel like I'm goin' crazy
It's fuckin' murder, baby
Run, run, run, the cops almost got me
Another tear drop, another fuckin' body
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another body
Uh, uh, uh, another fuckin' body, body
