Snoop Dogg
R &amp; G (Rhythm &amp; Gangsta): The Masterpiece
2004)
Every dog has his day
Another thirty nine inch thick classic (yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah)
Girl, as i sit here thinking to myself 
There is no one for you but me, and i mean that
And i think about all the things we've been through 
Like arguing and fighting for example
You know the love we have for each other 
It tends to out weigh what do to another 
Ya know my granddaddy use to always say 
Ya know he used to say it like this


There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns

Hanging with my homie from the turf, thats young q-ball
Giving me the word from the street, heres the scoop y'all
The niggaz from the eastsidaz split up (split up)
And one of 'em tried to fuck yo' shit up (what?)
Naw cuz, dont believe that, thats my nigga for life

Im at the church doing work, spittin game from the pulpit
Now thats the bidness, and god is my witness

I used to have a lot broads that i doont fool with
I used to have a lot of homeboys i aint cool with
A lotpeople that a nigga used to go to school with 
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin it 
But what none of them would believe though (what?)
That i would be bigger the kurtis blow 
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, im gettin' cake 
To realize your fate through faith, (through faith)
Cause we all gonna get that day (for what)
To see if our lives was straight
And to see if we gonna walk through thosse pearly gates (yeah?)
To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie
I'm tired of being stuck here 
If i could i would fly to the moon (zoom)
Y'all probably think im trippin off deeze mushrooms (i know)

Now as i think back to the words my granddaddy used to say 
I never seen him in church, but he always had the word
He would always tell me! sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad 
You gotta do bad in order to do good
