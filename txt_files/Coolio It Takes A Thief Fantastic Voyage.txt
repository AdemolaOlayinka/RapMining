Coolio
It Takes A Thief
1994)
Come on y'all let's take a ride
don't you say shit just get inside 
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
coz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
grab your gat with the extra clip and,
close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
kick it, kick it, yeah... that's the ticket
ain't no bloodin', ain't  no cripin'
ain't no punk-ass nigga's set trippin'
everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
and it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get yo' ass out the kitchen
we're on a mission

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide slippity-slide
with switches on the block in a '65
Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide who-ride
ain't no valley low enough for mountain high

I'm tryin' to find a place where I can live my life and
maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
place where my kids can play outside
without livin' in fear of a drive-by
and even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas
I keep on searchingcand I keep on looking
but niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
but sometimes my people be acting like they evil
you don't understand  about runnin' with a gang
coz you don't gang bang, and
you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
coz you got your own thang
you can't help me if you can't help yourself
you better make a left

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide slippity-slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide who-ride
that's why I pack my .45

Life is a bitch and then you die
still tryin' to get a peace of the apple pie
every game ain't the same, coz the game still remains
don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
if you don't work then you don't eat
and only down-ass niggas can ride with me 
hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block
stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
you gotta have heart son, if you wanna go,
watch this sweet chariot swing low
ain't nobody cryin` ain't nobody dyin
ain't  nobody worryin', everybody's tryin
nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
if you wanna have something, you better start frontin'
what ya gonna do when the 5 roll by
you better be ready, so you can ride

Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide slippity-slide
when you're living in a city it's do or die
Come  along and ride on a fantasic voyage
slide slide who-ride
you better be ready when the 5 roll by
just roll along- that's what you do
just roll along- that's right
just roll along- that's what you do
just roll along- that's right
do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
