2010)
Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (ah ah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay

what's up baller, I'm an owner now
You niggas ball for me, I be kickin' it up in my suite
Lookin' down ain't none of y'all fuckin with me
I'm like a bully that you mothafuckas hating to see
Better whisper my name, like The Wizard of OZ
If you say it three times, a lyrical barrage
This is not a mirage, there's no way to dodge
This Cobair engine, met before it collaged
I'm swearin to god, this worse than Jihad
Fuckin with Cube, is like the Book of Eli
I'm pullin my blade, I'm slicin you bastards
You local mothafuckas, I rap to the masses
You internet bitches, My pen is so vicious
The genies' out the bottle, and grantin no wishes
Before you attack, ya should've asked Mack
He would've told ya I'm the architect of Gangsta Rap

Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (blah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay

You mothafuckas in the D-League, I'm in the G-League
I got the most money, I smoke the best weed
I got the best kids, And the best life
With a fine wife, Nigga I'm in paradise
Amateurs think it's easy, but you and that bitch 
Ain't about to be the next george and weezy, Just pay to see me 
I'm a pro with a show that's incredible, You better let it go
Better learn how to do the dougie
Before I rap you in a snuggy and push you in the buggy
This is Ice Cube, know the people love me 
On some Spiritual shit, like the man above me (Cmon')

Ice Cube boombayay, (yeah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (ah ah!) boombayay
Ice Cube boombayay, (get up!) boombayay
