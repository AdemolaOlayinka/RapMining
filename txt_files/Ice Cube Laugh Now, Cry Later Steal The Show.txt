You know a lot of these bitches need an antibiotic
Moxacillin, Penicillin, something with a slin' in it
They want a sugar daddy, they want a man on a fixed income
They want man where they can come over to the old mans house
And go in the back porch and get $30 or $40 every here and there
And get in they honda and ride on off
