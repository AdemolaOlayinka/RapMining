Da Drought 3
2007)
I like my seat down low and my window slightly
Cracked riding with a bad hoe and her girlfriend in the back.
I like to get real high and never look back and you don't wanna try me don't
I look strapped

I come from the hardest city ain't nobody fucking with it
got a black and gold sole and a fresh new Orleans fitted,
a colared polo and a pair of bally bucks
young money motherfucker know you worried about us
cash money motherfucker C.M.R. I trust
Never had my jaw broken but his jaw I bust and I
Probably got you girlfriend on my bus what happened
On my bus stays on my bus and that white widow
Weed out the jar is a must if you gimme a cigar than
A cigar I bust put that white widow weed in the
Cigar and puff look ma I'm trying to make a prono
Staring us well not just us a couple foreign sluts
We could make the summer manal n tralling you all
And I be with Jim Jones and we be balling balling yeah
Baby we balling like rawlin and spaldin pint of DJ
Screw and that Hawaiian I am leaning like a three
Legged lion climbing right to the top of the motherfucking mountain
counting I'm gonna need an accountant
To count it, many got this fucking beat pounding it's
Pounding but it was just lost until I found it, found it
Stole it like a scoundrel holly grove hounded put
This bitch to sleep fucking right I night gowned it
Niggas talking shit tell them niggas pipe down
Bitch bloods in the building and every body soundless
beating up the track like a motherfucking round fist
Blind, deaf or crazy I will spit like a long kiss
I am just a martian ain't nobody else on this
Planet I know see I live by my only where my
Cheese nigga where my macaroni baby I get up
In that ass and act a donkey candy on candy nigga
Griping the grain see I am the only fire that can
Live in the rain I am so so new Orleans like 1825
Tulane bitch


See you gotta be from new Orleans to know what fuck I'm talking about
