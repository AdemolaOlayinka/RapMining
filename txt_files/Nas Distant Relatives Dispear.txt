Distant Relatives
with DAMIAN MARLEY)
Lord! 
This Spear, huh! 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh 
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey 
Ayatollah, Idi Amin, Mennelek, 
Man a Masai Warrior 
Despair, eh 
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear 
Like BURNING SPEAR 
AND SUCH AND SUCH BEFORE ME 
Who all fought for the cause and 
This Spear, eh 
Enforcing all the laws 

The Master of the Masses 
One has power 
The other one lacks it 
Guns are power 
Controlled by assets 
Owned by financial forecasters 
Who are the Masters? 
They are the Gangsters 
They are the bankers 
The ones who tax us 
The Masses 
They are us 
The sheep, the people 
Divided in classes 
I go off like a Shite bomb 
And All ya'll see I'm on my 
War paint on my face, shit 
My nine mm on my waist, shit 
I'm a problem 
Shoot up your place shit 
Let a few go 
Then I get low 
Blazing Haze again 
The Masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs 
The Elitists Groups 
The Masses 
They pray to Jesus 
Saying he will see us through 
The Masters are the aristocratic 
The Masses 
Ask if the Most High 
Is On his way here 
I'm trying to stay clear 
My mind is my modern day Spear 

Hey 
I say...
This Spear, huh! 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a Gideon 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh 
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey 
Through the hands of time and cruel men 
It has slew more than a billion 
Despair, eh 
It keep on suppressing the humble man's opinion 

This lead into Swiss cheese 
When the 5th squeeze 
Mislead 
The media Misleads 
Scares you to the point 
Where you miss sleep 
With that said 
This lead with this Ruger 
And that shooter 
Sub-machine gun 
Ratta tat through you 
Copper tops, hollow points 
Will do ya something bad 
Our future 
Is Mislead 
Three strikes 
There's no school 
When a teacher strikes 
This economy 
This monopoly 
Get no job 
Just own your property 
Now it's back to 
What comes natural 
Must survive any how you have to 
Despair, Desperation 
But I have no fear 
When I hold This Spear 


Mek some bwoy know mi nah smile 
Cause this spear nah beg friends 
Man a run racket 
Man a run scheme 
Man a run race 
Man a run down Benz 
Can't trust a she nor we nor eye 
Inna contact lense 
Man a run from police 
And a run down wealth 
And dollars and nah mek sense 

So, 
Rise up to my defense 
Hollow pointed is my preference 
Should have been deterred 
Don't know what you heard 
Get referred 
By the wrong reference 
When this spear start dispense 
It a fly and a tear through fence 
Dismember your members 
And all of your limbs 
Body bust inna nuff segments 
Well, 
Man a run drugs 
Man a run risk 
Man all a run out a time and ends 
Man a run up and down 
And a run fi dem life 
And a run down this month rent 
Nutin' nah gwan a yard 
And food deh a road 
Then man hafi go touch pavement 
Despair was a tool 
That was used to enslave man 
And mek manservant 
Escape from Despair and Desperation 
Becomes more urgent 
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul 
With spiritual detergent 
A distant army 
A distant relative 
Controlling the circumference 
And any man move with no permission 
They're feeling the circumstance of 

This Spear, hey 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a, eh 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh! 
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey 
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47 
This Spear, eh! 
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level 
This Spear 
Like Burning Spear 
And such and such before I 
Who all fought for the cause and 
This Spear, eh! 
They can't ignore me 
No!
