2009)
(No Ceilings muthafucka)
Nice tires on da ghini,
you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable zucchini
I live on the beach,
she walk around in her bikini
Girls are like school,
and i cut em like seniors
Im here to distinguish,
the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap,
get some money in between it
Glocs like police,
pumps like fenas
This beat gettin totaled,
Pam,Keisha,Kemas
Sittin on da World,
thinkin bout a girl
Pistol on my side,
paint you like mural
Dig in my pocket,
pulled out the party
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party
Ha Ha Hollygrove shit, im on my Hollygrove shit
Lookin for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Church like a choir and a couple of old priests
Elevator in my crib cause its five floors
Im not expectin you to have one inside yours;hahe
Vince Young, suicide doors, haha,
life’s a bitch ; now die for her.

I have the type of flow n-ggas don’t have to like,
my rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write,
the way I’m eating n-ggas wish they had my appetite,
straight up out of Texas and I’m major like apple white,
I pull four then I hit the exit door,
take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor,
hood smell the scent of money coming out my pours,
yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, bore,
I made it from a flyer to the forbes, (see me)
Young Elvis Freshly, yes he flyer than the store
dropping babys out and your chicks cheek, kicks neat
got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet
your daughter need someone to save her, not me,
I'm knocking hoes down like Laila Ali,
try hit and imma put the toaster to ya kidney,
then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney
Damn, its No Ceilings like a Colosseum,
candy slab, paint dripping like gonorrhea,
the way Im leaning I’m annoyed if I stand still,
flow harder than an anvil,
short (short)

Ok, its Gudda hoe,
all about my bills like buffalo,
your bitch under my sheets,
I heard she was an undercover hoe
purple got me moving slow,
like I’m in a snail race
pop pop pop 3 shots to the head,
then I pick up my shell case
leave em with a pale face,
yes I am a young money goon,
your girl like a motion picture she gon be coming soon
i do a certain rule, i pop her like balloons,
I pass her off to Millz then drop her off to tune,
couple screws lose, you don wanna play with him,
this is No Ceilings bitch, roofless like a stadium,
we shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
you want us your club, well nigga pay us then,
all grey BM, Im getting from my baby M,
she told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in,
don’t play no games hoe,
you know my name hoe,
G-U-D-D-A propane flow
