I see ya, I see ya
Girl I wanna love you long like ether
I know you want that pita
Girl I say I know you want that pita
That banana like Chikita
I'ma hit it like Derek Jeter 
The neighbors gon' think I beat her
I'll throw that dick much deeper
Come be my wide receiver
I'll give that girl a seizure
She forget her boyfriend, amnesia
She wanna ride it, I let her have it
She betta ride it like Danika Patrick
I get behind it, and move her
Like the Heimlich maneuver (OW!)



I don't know about you (chea)
But I'm really, really fucked up (chea)
No more liquor in my cup (chea)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to, time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to...



Bounce that booty like a basketball
See, I'm a ball-hog; I don't pass at all (ha-ha)
And now she wanna put her sister on 
Now I got twins like "The Whisper Song"
And you could call her Mrs. Me Too
I say I'm on a strict diet, I can only eat you
Lick it lick it, lick it, lick it;  I like to
Lick it lick it, lick it lick it..(ha-ha)
I got that Goose in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
I got patrone in my system,
Somebody gon' be my victim (OW!)



I don't know about you (chea)
But I'm really, really fucked up (chea)
No more liquor in my cup (chea)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to, time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to fuck (let's go)
I think it's time for us to, time for us to...

          
Come free yo' mind, on this dick that I have
You ain't gotta be my wife, but you need dick in yo' life
We gon' fuck all night long, I got kush in my bag
We can blaze one, and when we done
Go back to your man

I think I'm in love (love)
Oh, love (Oh love)


SIKE!
