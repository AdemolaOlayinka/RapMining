Public Enemy
There's A Poison Goin On
1999)
When flav starts to get busy
Grabbin the mic and they say who is he
Cock deezal breakdown like bill bixbie
When I think, yo I think in 360
Gimme the mic an I'ma solve all mystery
I dare any punk to try to step up and diss me
Cuz when he do, that's when he kiss dee
Titles go by and my style is fly
One more time I came here to rhyme
Gimme the mic and I'ma go for mine
So emcee's all a yall shut up
When flavor's in the house we say
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
Now when I do my flavor dance
All the ladies go crazy in a trance
Nonstop booy from the clock on my watch
I can bring it from the bottom and take it to the top
Let me rock, come on let me get wit it
When I tell you what to get, don't get offended
Gimme the mic and I'ma bend it
Transmissions from the sky yo I'll send it
Times on my hands yo sometimes I lend it
Though I'm spendin it for a fact
I'll make you say what what
Cause flave's back
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
Now everybody listen to flav
If you don't listen to me you will end up in your grave
Most of these people's rhymes is whack
But I got a bunch of rhymes in my napsack
Walk on my back with the black hat
Got the rhymes to come on the attack
Can't you tell that I'm really good lookin
They know me from miami, california
Back to brooklyn
Even in spain they knew flavor's name
In japan they know I'm nice in the game
We maintain yo brothers feel the vibe
We did the first album and it came out fly
And don't ask why you won't understand
Styles we got millions of fans
So come on get down like this what's up
When flavor grab the mic
I will rip your butt
What what
Let flavor blow it up
And if your ready to rock this party tonight
Somebody say what what
