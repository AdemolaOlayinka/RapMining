Run-D.M.C.
Tougher Than Leather
1988)
Many of our people..
stealing..
gambling..
Many of our people turn to..


Crime, time, nah I get mine
Climb, do fine, wine and just dine
Make, break, ill and just take
fate for God sake a break is at stake
Crack, wack, smack you right back
In fact you might last to jack if I crack
Cry, lie, do or just die
Live positive and give, but that's why "I'm not.."


"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that" (like like, like..)
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that!"


Dee the King me, and you knew it
??, so get to it
You want to flaunt and talk, and you're tryin
to taunt and want and want, cause you're dyin
Your place, race, chase, and I seen it
and now, child, bow, and I mean it
I came, saw, kicked, and you saw it
The crowd, proud and loud, and all for it
?? sin is wrong, so don't do it
We invented the song, and you blew it
I knew the time was right, so I wrote it
Here's the hook, look, so just quote it "I'm not.."


"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that!"


Comin off, time and time, and that's whether
you, your crew, knew, whatever
I did, done, do, I'm this clever
I come again and win, and you'll never
see a man like me, your idol
So joke, smoke, toke, but this title
the rhyme is mine, fine, and so vital
It's time for me to rock, my recital
Gonna tell you about a groove, that's comin
from the heart in part, and just one in
a million, or you, will be bummin
So check the time, the rhyme, that comes from it
Inside your brain, remain, so just keep it
plain, sane, refrain, so just peep it
Look, see it, check, but never stop it
The hook, comes, next, so Jay drop it! "I'm not.."


"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that" (like like, like..)
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that!"


Gotta go Joe you know, to the T-O, P
and see Dee, you know we know
the way today I say, I'm not a Leo
The King is Dee and Jay, he score ??
that's left to smile a while, keep grinnin
This past style, is wild, and I'm winnin
Roll, stroll, control, and I'm coolin
The King of Rock and Roll, and I'm rulin
I rhyme, shock and stop, and I'm droppin
I pop hip-hop, I'm hip-hoppin
Receive a G ?? while I'm throwin
It's D.M.C. it's me, I'm not goin "I'm not.."


"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that" (like like, like..)
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out" ..  "like, like-like that!"


Must, crush, us, you gotta
take, us, out, we're hotter
Team, is, mean, a lot of
work, in, volved, we're smarter
Dee, Jay, Run, no jokin
Hot, as, Hell, we're smokin
Punks, rumps, chumps, we're yokin
News, is, crews, are chokin
Out, like, that, not goin
in, like, men, we're growin
Chance, to, dance, not blowin
Go, to, show, don't roll in
Don't, you, know, we're stayin
here, to, show, not playin
Here's, the, jam, respect it
Time, to, end, THIS RECORD! "I'm not.."


"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that" (like like, like..)
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that", "I'm not!!"
"going" .. "out, out out" .. "like that!"
