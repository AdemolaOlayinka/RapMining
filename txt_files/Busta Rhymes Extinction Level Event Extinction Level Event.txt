Extinction Level Event
1998)
Uugh, yeah yeah here we go y'all
Here we here we here we go y'all
Busta Rhymes Flipmode y'all
Yeah yeah y'all extinction level event shit
Bomb threat to the whole world
What what what is going on
What the fuck going on here
Check it out yo
Holy amazing grace about face
Total erase you niggaz off the face of the place
Such a shame I had to go grab the calico
Pass the dough before you find out what I had to blast you for
Extreme laws for ones who did try to go against this
Wet your shit up like a sloppy tongue kiss
But don't know what you talking about
Without a doubt where my live niggaz give me a shout
On the strength shit niggaz check for
Connect the four shots and guess who blew it from next door
Time after time we gonna shine again
Feel it like a broad getting fucked from behind again
Ay yo, I be the closest thing to the next
Like the pain and suffering of about a million deaths
I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the extinction level event
Sing the song of salvation

La la la la laaaa la la
(What y'all gonna do where the fuck you gonna go)
La la la la laaaa la la
(Where the fuck y'all niggaz gonna run 
Where y'all niggaz think y'all running to son)
La la la la laaaa la la
(Bomb threat to the world
What the fuck going on with y'all niggaz out here)
La la la la laaaa la la
(We are now a soldier at dawn
Of glory emergency motherfuckas)

Yo, disregard your whole assignment
Crooked ass nigga need some realignment
Now all refinement
Crazy shit that do make me wanna know where my mind went
Blacking out building hostillity getting violent
Straight giving niggaz an ass whipping on consignment
Then I bust your shit 'til the day of my whole retirement
Shaking and rattle like we ready to battle
Fight seeing at every angle like a motherfucking satellite
Quickly bust up your crotches and fuck up your process
Bouncing in like even saying adios or even buenos notches
Have y'all niggaz wildin having a fit
Flame throwing lyrics like a bunch of blowtorch in this shit
Grand spectacular, chainsaw massacre
Thug fanatics street shit that be on the creep coming after you
Then we hit you with the most significant time bomb
Ready to designate at the slightest wave of a white arm
Best form of advice I could give is remain calm
The repercussion is something you could never imagine would be going on
Never believe in your eyes
When my squad some through at an astronomically large size
Moving the mountains
Keeping all of my niggaz bouncing
Big up my bitches in the place who be screaming and shouting
I'm only here to present
And bring the impact of the extinction level event
Sing the song of salvation

La la la la laaaa la la
(Once again as we welcome all motherfuckers in the world)
La la la la laaaa la la
(To experience the extinction level event)
La la la la laaaa la la
(The dawn of global emergency)
La la la la laaaa la la
(The moment where we all come together as one unison)
La la la la laaaa la la
(And completely dominate all global events)
La la la la laaaa la la
(We about to completely destroy all the whack bullshit)
La la la la laaaa la la
(That we got going on in our every and any reach)
La la la la laaaa la la
(All my live niggaz all my live bitches its motherfucking on)
La la la la laaaa la la
(As we enter the new millenium with this rap shit)
