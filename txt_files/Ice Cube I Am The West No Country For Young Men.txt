Many Motherfuckers Criticize Pros And How They Play
And Many Motherfuckers Criticize Rappers And What They Say
Even Though They Criticize Secretly They Fantasize
But They Know They'll Never Paid Be To Play
Yea I'm a Kill One Of You Young Punks

Tiger Woods Used To Be A Safe Nigga
Go Ahead Let Your Daughter Have A Date With Him
He'll Make With Her Prolly In A Wifebeater
TIger Bout To Change His Name To Cheater
I Don't Like It When You Call Me Big Poppa
From South Central And I Hate Helicopters
If We At School I'll Break In Your Locker
See Me With A Waterbottle Mixed With sparkle Vodka
Drink Responsibly Or Drink Constantly
Be Who You Wanna Be in This Economy
