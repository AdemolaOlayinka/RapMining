Dedication 2: Gangsta Grillz
2006)
Im a New Orleans gangtsa, after the storm 
Boy it took bout 3 million to rebuild my home 
But, Im back on defense Im back in the zone 
I eat rappers go in my yard and barry they bones 
My pockets on Raven Symone
Thats fat wutchu know bout that, huh 
So Im a keep it goin', keep it movin', we can do it I aint trippin 
So far ahead of them niggaz we got a time difference 
Dont confuse me wit them, Im different 
Tryin to holla at TIP for a movie audition 
I push that Masaradi to the limit 
Six seconds through that traffic like Emmit 
I tell them niggaz hury and buy 
And if you try snitch you'll get barried alive 
Yeah, and I dont chase 'em like you do 
I keep a bad bicth skatin' like New-New
