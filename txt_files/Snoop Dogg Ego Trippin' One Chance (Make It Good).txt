(Make It Good) You got one chance to crack
One shot to pop, better hit the spot
Cause there's a hundred other brothas that's waitin' in line
Player it's your time to (Make It Good)


Now you've been waitin', patient
Dinner datin', classic chasin'
Your homies hatin', 'cause you're never around
You're either at the movies or you're out shoppin' around
All that for the cat, it's a wrap
You gotta go hard if you get a chance to hit that
If you hit it then you gotta hit it harder
than any other brotha, the Karma Sutra be the author
Be her father, be a man, be the man
that made her never wanna see another man
Make it better than good, make it great
Make her visit, then make her stay

Yeah man, if you got a real one
You better hold on to her
See 'cause a real man will come along the way
And smooth knock her... 

If you like her, wife her
If you love her, smother her
With that stuff that'll make her feel the same way
And pull that ring out on the same day
A couple heirs with the horse and the carriage
You gon' lose if you scared of marriage
A real boss got a foundation
You need somebody in your life with patience
minus the hate... Shante what more can I say?
But baby look at us today
Your husband's a boss, the kids is cute
King of the Coast with a gang of loot

I'ma make it good for you, make it hood for you
Make it do what he couldn't do for you
Tha Doggfather supreme, jump in the shower
I appear through the steam
Braids and all, over six foot tall
Can't no other brotha fade the Dogg
I'm all ya need, I'm who ya want
I'm here to coach ya through your do's and don'ts and he won't
I got the remedy, the energy
It's your mama, your daddy, and then it's me
Bad talk a boss, I wish a player would
Close your eyes baby girl, let me (Make It Good)
