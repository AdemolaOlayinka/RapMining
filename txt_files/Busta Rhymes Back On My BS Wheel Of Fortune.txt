2009)
Hey ya'll niggaz thought I wasn't nice

he he he he he oh shit
Ayo Dj Scratch
Th-this how you want me to set it homie

I hope you ready to march niggaz, hut two three four
Back with the gangsta of rap, retort
I hope somebody quickly call up a doctor
Go get a medic, cause somebody 'bout get finally resected
Oh shit nigga goin' insane, muthafucka
'Bout to bloodshed ya cell membrane, shit the propane bitch
The fine cocaine, lil' nigga you touch the shit that ya can't contain I
Fill'em with octane, light another fire nigga
'Till I'm high killa, ignite another flame ah, sorry I dig his talent
Well tie ya little lame look, Ok it don't matter
Cause I'm the one to blame I'm, startin' to act strange
Facin' every challange shit, incredible hope
Lyrical amalgam bitch, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'ma band and oh ring everything like El DeBarge

(oooh ooooh and I like it I like it)
And so I said and so I said
Excuse me dear -- My gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her -- better double the price
But let's get it niggaz and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
And let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
All my niggaz jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
My ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY

I'ma take off my jacket now, you see I'm back on my bull shit
You tired lil' niggaz go in line, watch how
I vibe on mine, I'm shifting the climate, quiet
And if you wan' test what I'm on bitch
I wish you niggaz try it, uhh-uh-uhh, I mentioned that I'm back
To cause the riot, (hot drops), and I come to supply it
Hu-hu you niggaz on a diet, you can't stop it, then I drop
Ya know ya can't deny it, my home boy you know that I'm a crook
And I'ma try it, while I'm counting this money and I hide it
I'm taking it back, puttin' ya hands in my eyes, can't see
You get to puttin' yo eyes on me, look, look how I drop shit
I got hit, I won't quit, and bet you see I'm back in a cockpit
I'm coming back like I'm moving the crooks
Everybody gather around, and get ya to singin' the hook

(oooh ooooh and I like it I like it)
And so I said and so I said
Excuse me dear -- My gosh you look nice
Put ya money on her -- better double the price
But let's get it niggaz and jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
And let's jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
All my niggaz jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
My ladies jump
(Behind the wheel of fortune) HEY
