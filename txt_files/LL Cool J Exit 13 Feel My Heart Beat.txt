Hey yall,

We get the sweating you can feel my heartbeat

Baby its time to switch out the way things go 
Tonights the night you'll be in control 
I bought you a uniform so your could play the role 
Now heres the stethascope 

Lady, i know before we was going kinda cold 
The same old the same old we seem to take a toll 
Tryin to take it back take a sip all go 
And try a couple things we never did before 
Maby you could be a freak for me at the door 
I come up to the crib you dressed ready to go 
Girl take it down low n make it clap real slow 
I never had so much fun without spending dough 
Baby you the star of the big boy show 
I love you even more now you unpredictable 
Once we in the bedroom there no telling wha we do 
So what you wanna do?

Yeah time for you to buss out the new red pumps 
Ima lick shots let the box spring jump 
Go ahead n play the roll ima give you what you want 
Side to side bring it back to the front 
Dress up like the martials on a man hunt
