It's me, the rapper eater
Ha
Feed me, feed me, feed me
Ahaha no homo
Yeah

One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Lil' Weezy
Baby if you ask me, if your nasty
Creative, gifted bastards spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it systematic

Damn right, I kissed my Daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my Daddy is
And I'm his kid, I stunt with my Daddy
Call Ms Lee, she with my Daddy
So diss me, and don't diss my Daddy
'Cause who was there when no one wasn't
Just my Daddy
Who was there when I needed money
Just my Daddy
So who be there when I see the money
Just my Daddy
Who said that I'd be the one
Just my Daddy
Hello Hip-Hop, I'm home
It's your Daddy

When I say these
I don't mean the caddy
I mean these nuts, Akon and Khaled
Rick Ross, Tip, Stunting and Fat Joe
And I can-can-can't forget Brisco
And yeah, I had to squash the bullshit with so
Its a bakery here, just trying to get dough
Shout through my dreads my Haitians and chicos
You looking for me, Ho
I'm in the 3-0
5 I'm the best rapper alive
Homeboy gotta mind that a map couldn't find
Homeboy gotta nine gotta that a cop couldn't find
But I'd be getting to it even if I was blind
Like a scary movie they screaming when I rhyme
I'm a King, you can ask Stephen if I'm lying
I'm a Prince, too demanding like my Mom
Too bold, too cold like wet salami and

ME, ME
It's all about ME
If a girl got a voice then she talk bout ME (me)
He say, she say, I say ME
We'll be in the M.I.A. ME
And me, and T, and big Ronnie
And the homie Street probably somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E probably somewhere in the jeep
And Marl in the Phantom with Mr. G

And ME, ME, it's all about ME
Play with me and it's all our beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!,
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great! Scott!
Storch! Can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my click go all out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out

Boy, I don't know what y'all bout
But, I just spit like a dog mouth
Big ice been looking like a hog mouth
VROOOOOOMM, I had to bring the hog out(yeah)
Light them trees, bring a log out
Every day, Christmas, I'm eggnogged out
And Hip-Hop is my new bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out (bye)
