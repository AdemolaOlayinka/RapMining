I'm not saying this to shake you up sing
I'm just saying this to wake you up saying
It's all good when we're making love
All I'm asking is don't take our love
For granted, 'cause granted my love for you is real (oh)
If you don't love me, somebody else will
Babygirl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable (comfortable)


To the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest you can step
Feeling (Irreplaceable) listening to (Beyonce)
Well okay I put you out on your (B'Day)
Hey, now if you rocking with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank baby we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like souffle
Don't I look at you like I see a new day
And don't I do what I do say
I'm through talking so I'm gonna let you 'face
And let 'ye do ''ye




Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talking 'bout leaving, and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'm gonna send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leaving the best
So you will have to settle for less
And I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the virginsy
'Cause under the sheets I am a mess
Yes, baby you're blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on

You, your love, your sex
You know I work you out like Bowflex
He he, I jokes no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbours get no rest
We can get together never disconnect
Yeah, yo' back yo' neck
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet
To us, so let's project
You stay in, never incorrect 'face
