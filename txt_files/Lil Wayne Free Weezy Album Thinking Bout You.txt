Lil Wayne
Free Weezy Album
2015)
Uhh, Uhh, I was chilling on a set
With a fully automatic tec
Thinking bout you girl
I was, working my jugg girl
But I was still thinking bout you
Uhh, bow wow wow yippie yo yippie ya
Can't trust these dog ass hoes today
I say bow wow wow yippie yo yippie ya
Can't trust these dog ass hoes today
But I got one I really fuck with
She make my heart skip a beat
She dropped her drum stick
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick
I eat that pussy cause it's sweet as sweet as one six
Sixteen bullets in a clip I'm loading one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine it's sweet as fun dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
Cause she don't get me drama you don't want no drama
My goons wait for you to snap like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat we leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell you I don't own that morning hours
Chilling on a set
With a fully automatic tec
Thinking bout you girl
I was, working my jugg girl
But I was still thinking bout you

It go U N L V
It go, it go U N L V
It go U N L V, U N LV
Uptown nigga living violent do I smell beef
I was chilling on a corner bout to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40 and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chilling po was home talking on a phone
Lord it's been such a good year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hood he on a set he got his hoodie on
Euro's the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord I know I do my thing can’t let my thing do me
Lord I know I ain’t a saint still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree this murder in the first degree
I got that tech under my arm like right guard, sure, degree
Lord sometimes I just be so gone I be like earth to me
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I serve a fiend while I was
Chilling on a set
With a fully automatic tec
I was thinking bout you girl
I was, working my jugg girl
But I was still thinking bout you girl
