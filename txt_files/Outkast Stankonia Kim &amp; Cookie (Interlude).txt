 Say hello Cookie!
 Hello
 Girl, I got something to tell ya
 Spill it girl, spill it
 Remember ol' boi, at the club...
 From last night?
 Last night!
 What's up?
 Went home with the mothafucka, now I'm thinkin I'm fittin' to goddamn get my ass to' up!
But girl...
 What?
 Dick so short!
(Short!) 
He came quick, he got his, I ain't get mine, I'm like: fuck!
(Fuck!)
You know you talkin' all that goddamn shit and you ain't shit!
 Girl, you got you a mothafuckin minute man!
 A minute mothafuckin man
(Mothafuckin minute man!)
But it's all good you hear me? Cause before I goddamn left this mothafucka,
I hit this mothafucka up for everything, you hear me!
I'm talkin 'bout wallet, I'm talkin 'bout credit cards, money.
And you know what, I was gonna hit the motherfucker up for his goddamn pistol
but I ain't know how many mothafuckin bodies he had on, that mothafucka, you feel me!
(I feel ya!)
 Well it's all good
(Break!)
