Busta Rhymes
When Disaster Strikes
1997)
Zigga 
Ha ha ha, yo
Ya'll 
Yo, I walk through brick walls
Fuck around hijack your whole shopping mall
I be ripping shit, that's my word bond
Scream then I watch the whole planet earth respond
Do just what ya told
The remote control
Crash course yo' shit
Ya know how we roll
When I tumble and drive then you reply my my my my my my
Yo I execute all plans
Run up in two bitches for me and my mans
Ha, breaking fool, ha-for my fans
In return niggas give me the-HOT-SoundScans
Strike matches, golden egg hatches
Request line is open send all your faxes
Freaks the flows with no rehearsing
Pull the skate back which when the beat start reversing
Just so wack you make people start cursing
Flows contradict worser than the King James version
Turn on the mic but your shit will stop working
Beats brutalized your whole rhyme, your head hurting
Broomsticks and witches from rags to riches
Forget mad love
Well ya'll niggas will burn bridges
Amateur, why won't you look right at the calender
A matter of time before I start to damage ya
So starving to just bust my rhyme caliber
Consecutive wounds like a nigga stabbing ya
Ya, my whole team get wild cream
Poloticin every move to the extreme

So hardcore like Quickdraw McGraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before
Ha, yo I come right through the door
With rhymes galore Busta Rhymes be the ambassador
Explore my metaphor you beg for more
Hardcore see we assure the insecure
I said my whole squad of niggas come through and break the law
My family tight more than Connect Four
I come through and create the master pieces
Bend your mind with rhyme telekinesis
Yo, I will break shit down
Lost or found floor will blast like a four pound
Right before I hit you off with my vaccine
Starch, carbohydrates lots of protein
Vaccine baby girl yo I hope your ass clean
Magazine frontine fly lips is lime green
Ya'll, every time ya'll, I'm on the scene
High beam the lights and watch will remain supreme, ha
Don't ya know when I keep it coming
Blow the fort
Make ya wrist hard to hand cuffing
Bounce on the beat and watch how a nigga work it
Buck wild making ya speaker short curcit
This heavy weight tip the scale on the triple beam
Busta Rhymes blast and still bang the mainstream, blow
I had ta make ya all mad
Hit ya off, interlude
Bounce to Trinidad
Now I see ya bitch nigga sounding so soft
Make a nigga cough, breaking and turn ya ass off
Extra raw lay on your back get on the floor
Busta Rhymes got to headline the whole ball
Cause we so hardcore like Quickdraw McGraw
Fuck what you heard we ain't heard this before

Ya'll ......
