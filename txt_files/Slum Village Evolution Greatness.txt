2013)
Lookin at the world thru my minds eye
Picturin the time as it flies by
Goin at the speed of light
I'm leavin out ya eye sight
I am an invisible energy field of pure light
I can manifest anything tangible
That I like
All I gotta do is visualize it in my life
And all is see is love and it shines bright
It illuminates everything in my eye sight
I'm a feather weightless
Free and floating
No more segregation
No more hesitation
Livin every single moment
In my meditation
While I'm walkin
Every single step is an elevation
While I'm talkin
Every single breathe sends me levitatin
I couldn't before because I didn't have
The patience
But the higherself inside of me
Was Waiting there patiently
For me to open my heart
So my love wouldn't be waisted
Your true essence is so close
You can taste it
That's the bare naked truth
But most people can't take it

Made my moves paid my dues earned my respect
My passion was the cause now my effect
Cause of faithfulness I'm destined for greatness yea

I can move moutains mind over matter
Thought process deeper than atlantis so enchanting
Light shine bright from the solar plexusp
Positive energy Jah is my reflection
Love is my selection protection floating on a higher level
My mind drops gem and hold em like a bezzle
Meditate over the madness infiltrate sadness to gladness
Pessimistics left stagnet only happiness in my dragnet
My concept since I was a fragment
Somewhere up in the stratus my spirit flys free thru the galaxy... meta

Made my moves paid my dues earned my respect
My passion was the cause now my effect
Cause of faithfulness I'm destined for greatness yea

Put yourself in my predicament
To here lies from a few and know your one with the infinite
Lies of of true baptize and it's interment
Knives penetrate your skin why cause the son of man
No one is innocent in our defense
In the eyes of tenement the city high
Rise like yearly rent
Protocol is that we all must fall
They teaching false beliefs like it ain't tomorrow
Even if we gone decease man we all live on
Me threw my lines and poems threw the seeds that's born
Relationships they get build to be rip and torn
And we all newly born just go beyond but fuck it
That's why you always see me stargazing
Trying to reach higher self with higher
Highs threw mediation
It took a lot of will a lot of p
A lot skill a lot time is kilt, but it's real
It's not the fakeness
You can take it how you take it
But why you contemplating me and
The most high is have conversations
Love

Made my moves paid my dues earned my respect
My passion was the cause now my effect
Cause of faithfulness I'm destined for greatness yea
