Hey all you kids out there! Welcome to Three 
Feet High and Rising. Now, here's what we do. The following 
contestants... how are you doing, contestants? 

 (General babble, inc. 'Okay', 'Alright', 'Yo Mama') 

 So fellas, tell us a little bit about yourselves. 
Contestant number one! 

 How ya doin', Al. Just came all the way 
down from Wichita just to be on this show. You know it's 
gonna be swell and I'm gonna win all the money. Gonna win all 
the money. See ya. 

 Okay, contestant number 2. 

 Excuse me, um, my name is, um, P.A. Mase,

 Okay, contestant number 3.

and I'm just... glad to be on the show. Thank you. 

 Okay. Now we've met the contestants, let's get to 
the game! I'm going to ask an amount of four questions, and 
the contestants will try to answer them correctly. Now, you 
out there in the audience can answer along with them. 
How many feathers are on a Perdue chicken? 
How many fibres are intertwined in a Shredded Wheat biscuit? 
What does "touche et lele pu" mean? 
How many times did the Batmobile catch a flat? 

Now that we know the questions, we'll let the contestants 
think them over, and we'll return right after these messages.
