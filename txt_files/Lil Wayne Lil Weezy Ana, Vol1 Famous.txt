Oil, slick like Syntec
Inject
Even the paralyzed feel my impact
As I
Skim back
Over my words that's on the page, I'm lyin
I don't write
I get high
And ignite
I got a serious mental plan
And
Dental plan
And
You don't want to bring the giant out of the gentle-man
Gee, golly, gigabytes, and a Gorilla's hand
To the side of a nigga face like I don't give a damn
Even if he's with his mans
And thems
I put his plans
And limbs
All over his pants
And Timbs
And I wasn't fortunate to grow up like The Sims
But instead I blew up
Before I grew up
I spend 8 and put 2 up
Cause you never know when I have to do what
Do when?
Do who?
Do you
And you two
And, you too..
Now, I'm Cuckoo
Like birds
With my words
I'm poopoo
Meaning I am the shit on you turds
Yes, and I get on your nerves
Yes, and I get on your nerves
And yes:  And I get on your nerves
And sit on your mind like piss on the curb
Bitch-bitch! Disturb me?
While I'm working?
You are just another Earthling
Be in the game, shit I must be first-string
I like my tucks baggy and my turf clean
Check my pattern/scheme
I probly have on rocks from the Moon, and Saturn's Ring
Uh, whose badder
Give 'em a ladder
Tell them climb on up here and watch me get at her
The badder part about it is, these niggas hate
But you won't even get a bar on my mixtape
I'm probly on a boat feedin a bitch grapes
And crepes
By the way
That's French pancakes
Je parlons Francais tres bien
Garcon adore chaude lesbiennes
Pardon my French
Pardon the stench
But I smoke that Grinch
Til my eyes squinch
I meant
Squint
I'm so bent
Like a dent
But bitch, I'm still no Clark Kent
And my Momma used to tell me
Not to let nobody fuck with me
It stuck with me
I keep it real to the world: Publicly
Unbelievable...
I said my Momma used to tell me
Not to let nobody fuck with me
It stuck with me
I keep it real to the world: Publicly
Unbelievable...
Bitches say they love you
But they hate you
And they say that it's all a part of our animal nature
Son, just watch your damn behavior
Cause every animal has a tamer
I come from where the Gangstas came from
Go down like the rain that the drain sucks
Goddamn the game sucks:
Thank God I'm Famous
