Da Drought 3
2007)
I remember then
Back in december, it wuz winter
Like '89
Shit i must of been 7 goin on 8
And comin from da kitchen wuz a echo from all da base
And i aint talkin bout speakas umm mmm
I saw my daddy in there i would stare
But i wouldnt touch
But it wasnt because i didnt know enough
Shit..i jus knew too much
So i stop bein lazy, and i became creative
And i learned how to create it
And all dat pots for me!!!
So come see... or come eat

And i hope dat she is having da ride of her life
No red lights inside, jus a bare room wit green lights ummm mmm
Come on now 
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
Haahaaa thats ur hoe my guns of water help your garden grow...no

Yeah i know dat wuz crazy
But i think u are more crazy..yer 
Than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
Wit no seeds
So she cant eat

My heroes had da broads and da cars wit big ol' rims
And i could remember slangin, thinkin 
I wanna be like them 
Ever since i was little, ever since i was little 
I lived life numb

It made so much since for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cuz i aint dumb umm mmm

And dat shit i hated
Like early 90s late 80s
I wuz husltin as a baby
U can ask eagle street, about me
Ima g

Ever since i wuz little eva since i wuz little i tote my gun
Cuz it made no sense where i wuz from hmmm 
To walk around wit none
Shit,nicca u would be crazy
Cuz niccas is crazy
And im a 80s baby
U should be proud of me
Cuz in dem streets
Im hot like da 80s
And my temperatures raisin
Im at 100 im blazin
Sumbody shower me
Please pret-ty please

You can call me wizzle or u can call me wayne
Man eitha one but its weezy baby for your slut
I told her weezy baby, i told her more than once
But she just say baby, she jus calls me baby
She jus screams out baby, when she's on top of me
And da sheets be stickin like pages
And da bed is so stanky 
If she say dat is my baby, shit it is prossibly not for me
M.-O.-E.
