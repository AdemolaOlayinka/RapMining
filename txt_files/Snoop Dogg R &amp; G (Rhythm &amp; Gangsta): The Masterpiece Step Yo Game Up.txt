Yeah Man What's Going on Man It's really really pimpin' up in here man

You know what I'm sayin' missin in action I ain't been on no milk carton box
but I've been milking and boxing these bitches
cuz they got to step they game up you know what I mean


What you lookin' at (step yo game up!)
What you waitin' for (step yo game up!)
Go on come on in the door (step yo game up!)
Drop it to the floor and just (step yo game up!)
You a kid (step yo game up!)
You drink gin (step yo game up!)
Is that your friend (step yo game up!)
Tell a nigga you with you better (step yo game up!)



 Break it down bitch, let me see you back it up

 Back that pussy tease a motherfucker

 Rub that shit it's yours bitch, grab his dick it's yours bitch

 Now turn around bitch, put that ass on a nigga, grind on his dick make it get a little
bigger




Bitch wanna act like she ain't never been with fast lane pimpin' on em
Nails with the french tip potato chip yup with a french dip say she wanna french kiss all on my diz-nick
It's cool, go on and break fool if you have to, what which you won't do, bitch I'ma slap you
Stay in line ho it's a pimp affair, if you down to get low I can take you there
But you can't fake once you hit the gate, shake till it ache, work that birthday cake
You say you wanna make it ho, well quit bullshittin' and get naked ho
Now you always got to be hot and vicious, so move them biscuits and hit them tricks bitch
Now you got about a minute to fix this cuz I'm trying to find a bitch that's bootylicious




P-U-S-S-Y, run a world, I'm the girl in the flesh ah
Lookin' for a nigga that will suck me like a blow pop
Run that dick to the door, do me baby don't stop
Same nigga talkin' all that shit
Just a little bitch, little balls, little dick
Let me show you how to work your tongue like a hurricane
We ain't here to play no games, baby give me everything
I know you like me when I drop it down low
Show it from the back, look back, let it roll
Drop it to the floor like a g-bitch supposed to
Shake it shake it shake it make a nigga go postal
But that's for fucking with a miami girl (?)
Get your man, take his money, and then buy the world
So nigga don't front, cuz fat wallets and big dicks is all I want
