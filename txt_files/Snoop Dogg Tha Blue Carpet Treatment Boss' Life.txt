Snoop Dogg
Tha Blue Carpet Treatment
2006)
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
So many niggaz wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the Bs and the Cs, and the Ds and the Hs
And the Gs putting work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really
A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'ma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll. Don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with something pimpish
And it's coming from the beach where them niggaz is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga.. the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish

See me man, I'm nothing like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leaning in my ride, fo' fifth, cock banging
Me, I'm riding by ya on the corner, block slangin
I'm living that boss' life (life)
The hoes come running when they see me coming
I'm living that boss' life (life)
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money (my money)

This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
Khaki's and them Tim's and them niggaz with the platinum mouths
Thinking that they blessed by the actions that be coming out
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But tricking ain't the route (route), that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holding it when they can't do without it
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fucking with it for a dollar
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Bo$$ Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breaking out (Tha Doggfather)
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him, having diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walking on the blue carpet with the Doctor (Doctor)
