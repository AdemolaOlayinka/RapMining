Public Enemy
Most Of My Heroes Still Don't Appear On No Stamp
2012)
5-1 not 5-0
Ima b52 
Bomb drop non stop spitting on you
Never have so many 
Been screwed by so few 
Call to save y'all
So whatcho wanna do? 
At the age I'm at now if I can't teach
I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak
Real talk raising strong down from the weak
Chuck d got tea party beef
Why represent where you cant sleep?
40 aches jackass is six feet deep
Lost in the same space y'all call the streets
I walk real talk across these beats 
At the age I am now 
If I can't teach 
I should even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be makin y'all weak
24hours 7 days a week 

I be the king from the streets of hollis queens new york
The only thing you get from dmc is real talk
The cow makes beef and the pig makes pork
I gotta walk this way 'cause it's the way I walk
From the halls in the hood to the halls of fame
I got that east coast flavor and that west coast game
I jam with jackal and jesse james 
You gotta call me the king when you say my name

I go hard for the people in the streets (real talk)
The king of the rhymes and the beats (real talk)
Adidas is the sneakers on my feet (real talk)
And it's the children in the streets we gotta reach (real talk)
I rock on real talk 
The way the side walks 
Whats up with the radio inside new york
Underneath them streets
Man made concrete
Is mother earth
And gods work 
This ain't new 
Cause y'all ain't never knew 
No tears tell your peers inform your crew
Causetruth is truth
No matter what I think
I take out garbage
When it tends to stink 
No joke no smoke
I don't drink
Mrchuck d
Tweet me so we can link
See I been your age
You ain't been mine
Feels like I was born a second time this rhyme I wrote 
Took a long ass time
Leave that wackness way behind
At the age I am now 
If I can't teach 
I should even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be makin y'all weak
24hours7 days a week 

I be the good crowd rocker, the best mc
I be the world's greatest rapper if you want me to be
But all that crap means nothing to me
If I can't give 'em vision and something to see
It's more powerful than your politics
All you stupid politicians can suck a thumb
Me and chuck d we do not run
Like my man said a change is gonna come
So don't be stupid don't be so dumb
There are no cuss words for y'all to beep
But I am cursing out the leaders that are still asleep
And all you wack-ass rappers, your talk is cheap
See my talk is really real 'cause my voice is deep
Now I used to rock rhymes with the reverend
From run dmc there's nothing better than...
The microphone killin', head severin'
And if you're sick of wack rappin' I'm the medicine.
Noise of my voice
Voice of the voiceless
Against the
Racist
Classist
Homophobic 
Sexist, 
Xenophobic
That sits 
So deep
Within us
Can't get help
From those 
Famous just to be famous
The powers that be separate us and hate us
When you need em
They go on hiatus 
They hate us
It don't matter 
They cant mistake us
For somebody else
They tried to break us
No need to dumb down or even young down
Cause my standards
Is high 
They cant understand it
Some of them cant stand it
They cant understand it
Songwriter yall know it
More than a poet
Living life not lies
So the people can know it
At the age I am now 
If I can't teach 
I should even open my mouth to speak
I bomb drop on those that be makin y'all weak
24 hours 7 days a week
