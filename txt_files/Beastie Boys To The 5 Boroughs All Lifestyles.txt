Beastie Boys
To The 5 Boroughs
2004)
Ideas spark my hand grabs a pen 
Sweeten up the sound let me get the right blend 
Coming down the wire to the Neve mic pre 
Nice up the sound for the A to D 
I'm a Wonderama snake can winner 
Bagel from Bob and a TV Dinner 
I'm the one that one that dance contest 
'Cause you know I dance the best 
All you gotta do is do your thing you see 
'Cause I don't give a fuck who you're supposed to be 
My name is Adrock and I aim to please 
And I gotta spread love in society 

We gotta keep the party going on 
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and form 

What you saw what you heard 
I get involved I might disturb 
And if you want what's going down 
You might just get that silky sound 
So what'cha want? So what'cha need? 
I've got the fonts you want to read 
Get in the game you gotta scheme 
All the same I've got the team 
More new wave not OG 
Walking down the block you say "Yo D! 
When you coming out with the new CD 
That spreads love in society?" 

We gotta keep the party going on 
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and form 

Goto goto goto goto 
Don't mess with crack or the baking soda 
Whether in the high rise where you live like Roda 
Or in the shack and you live like Yoda 
Once again it's on like a brand new morn 
Beatsie Beatsie Boys here to keep you all warm 
All you spazzes and you freaks 
Go and do your thing 'cause you're unique 
If it don't hurt nobody else than 
Don't be afraid to be yourself and 
Special dedication and so on 
to all lifestyles, sizes, shapes and forms 
We gotta keep the party going on 
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and form
