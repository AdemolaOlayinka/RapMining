Every January 16th, it's "The Dreamer, The Dreamer."
And all of you say, "I have a dream; The Dreamer."
And what did he dream?It stuck him right there.
And little black boys, and little white girls
will one day hold hands together.
Shit.
Is that where it's at?Is that where it's at now?
Them little blacks hands are yours.
You can't hold the black brothers' hands?
But you gonna grow old holdin' crackers' hands
before you hold each other's hands?
You gonna walk with your enemy
before you learn to walk with one another?
How sick can you be?
