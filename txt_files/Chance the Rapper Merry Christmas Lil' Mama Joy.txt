Merry Christmas Lil' Mama
2016
Christmas, this Christmas, there's a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy
(He was a little boy, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love (forget about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Get right back to joy, get right back to joy)
Baby let's light up the Christmas tree
Spike the eggnog with the Hennessy
Spread the love that hit the coldest winter
Jingle bells is all I could remember
'Tis the season we should spread the cheer
Christmas caroling door-to-door
Can't forget just what we do this for
When can we get back to the joy
Got some hot chocolate for you babe
Silent nights just set me up
Can't tell me that you not you my angel
We should make snow angel doves
Outside, lookin' Christmas and you just who I'm thinkin' of
Favourite time of year, can you feel the love?
Christmas, this Christmas, there's a time for joy
(There's a time for joy, there's a time for joy)
When Jesus, was a little boy
(He was a little boy, was a little boy)
They tend to forget about love (forget about love)
Let's get right back to joy
(Bundle of joy)
Why y'all always arguing and carrying on
Christmas was meant for sharing a blunt
Google Chicago Betty Jones them kids buried their mom
Sometimes I dream I'm moving a spot where cops carry batons
So I could visit with jet lag
Lose all my check bags
To wake up in my old room with beauties from Jet Mag
I hate when y'all talk about bail money
Who go to jail for me and who tryna steal from me
I got that Sister Carolyn Jenkins KOK covenant love
I'm covered at the door that covers the blood
Bungalow Jungle that housed a thousand fistfights that humble my buds
Couple birds that make me wonder what was
Won't let the lawyers destroy us
The Pontius Pilates judge my bundle of joys
I know my bronze is gorgeous
Know who the birthday boy is
I'm on my 773 love
Weaponize free love, 7979 (7777)
