Where there's life there is water
We depend on mama nature
there's a message for tomorrow
Everything connects to you
Some say soon it will be over
you can see it in the weather
out of tune with mama nature
what you do comes back to you

We're not alone 


Confucius, Confucius
Sigmund Freud
And Fard Muhammad
Is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth
State troopers or FEDs come out to silence you
My house in Malibu probably tapped
Because living next door to Demi Moore
Plus, I'm black
Plus, I want vengeance for the poor
Who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus
Sticky in the jar-s
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's brown and
Twenty years from now
Every town will be brown and Latin
An African lookin Manhattan
I'ma tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax, back in 9-9
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A., in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying



Every mother, every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
Its an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we're all in the struggle
If i know one thing is true...

We're not alone 


Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population
My observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disc
Right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors, probably live with us
They can mimic us
It's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas



Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
Its good to be alive
Its good to be alive
Nobody is an island
we are part of an environment
Only way we gone survive
Is if we harmonize

We're not alone 


Reginald Lewis
The black billionaire
Before Oprah or Bob Johnson
How'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFO's in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes
And I swear, like Warren Buffet
Real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond-encrusted shit, live illustrious
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy-bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas about to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks the teenager of this world
Give us twenty more years to grow up
Already geniuses; what I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan van Sertima
He inserted something in me
That made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution
I'm his hood interpreter



Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
Its good to be alive
Its good to be alive
Nobody is an island
we are part of an environment
Only way we gone survive
Is if we harmonize 

We're not alone
