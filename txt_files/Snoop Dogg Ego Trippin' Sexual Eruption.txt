I'm gonna take my time
She gonna get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroke


So she can get a
Sexual eruption
So I can get a

She might be with him
But she's thinkin' 'bout
Me

We don't go to the malls
We don't go out to
Eat

All that we ever do
Is play in the
Sheets
Sheets

Smoke us a cigarette
Then go back to Sleep

Sexual eruption

Doggy Dogg is a freak

I keep a bad bitch with me
Seven days out the week

And all that we ever do
Is play in the sheets
Sheets

Then smoke us a cigarette
Then go back to sleep
Sleep

I was all on the
Club, sippin' some Hen, smokin' on a blunt of dro
When I peeped this little hoe out
I was all on the
Bar, wind drift up
Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through
Dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a nigga know
If I take her home, with them wide ass hips
You damn right, I'm gonna beep
So I a-
Proached the chick with the real pretty face
Big ass booty with a little bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil' mama, what you drink?"
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gonna say shit
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some fuck faces
But it wasn't no use for me to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption


Sexual eruption (A sexual eruption)
Sexual eruption
Orgasms
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Whoa
Whoa
Sexual eruption
All the time, anytime
Sexual eruption
Whoa
