As I think of you I hear, precious moments crystal clear, lying in my mind
I see birds in paradise, cherry blossoms and moonlight, you're the joy of all mankind
That's why (That's why). When we dream of you (Dreamin')
We believe anything that we see
That's why (That's why). It's because of you (Of you)
We would like your dreams (My dreams). Turn to reality (Reality)
Taking walks in the park, getting closer to your heart, is all I want to do (All I want to do)
Someone sure likes you up above, because you're living the life we love, and you know it's true (You know it, you know it)
Whoa Stevie, that's why (That's why). When we dream of you (Dreamin')
We believe anything that you see
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's why (That's why). It's because of you (Of you)
We would like your dreams (Our dreams). Turn to reality (Reality)
Dreamin' (Dreamin') is so mellow (Mellow), when I (Dreamin' about you) about you (Stevie), dream about you
Dreamin' (Dreamin') is so mellow (Mellow), when I dream about you Stevie, (When we dream about you, yeah)
