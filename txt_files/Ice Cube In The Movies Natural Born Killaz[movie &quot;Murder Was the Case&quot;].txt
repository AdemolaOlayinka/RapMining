2007)
Journey with me
Into the mind of a maniac
Doomed to be a killer
Since I came out the nutsac
I'm in a murderous mindstate
With a heart full of terror
I see the devil in the mirror
Buck buck, lights out
'Cause when I grab my sawed-off
Niggaz get hauled off
Barrel one
Touches your motherfuckin' flesh
Barrel two
Tears your fuckin' heart out your chest
You see I'm quick to let the hammer go click
On my Tech-9 so if you try to wreck mine
Fool it's your bed time
Feel the blast from the chocolate bomber
Infrared aimed at your head
Like your name was Sarah Conner
Decapitatin' I aint hesitatin'
To put you in the funeral home
With a bullet in your dome
I'm hot like lava
You got a problem?
I got a problem solver
And his name is revolver
It's like a deadly game of freeze tag
I touch you with a .44 mag
And you're frozen inside a body bag
Nobody iller
Than this grave yard filler
Cap peeler
Cause I'm a natural born killa


Terror illustrates my era
Now I can't hang around my momma
Cause I scare her
I want to blast motherfuckers up
It feels like I'm bustin' a nut
When I open you up
Cause your body is exposed to the midnight mist
All you weak motherfuckers give my ring a kiss
Cause I'm givin dirt naps
Comin' with them bomb ass raps
To make your lungs collapse perhaps
You never sleep
Cause evertime you doze
You catch blows to the motherfuckin' nose
Ain't seen the sun, in 66 days
Let me count the ways in a fucked up maze
I never ever ever made a ho stay
But I'm down with Dre
Like AC is down with OJ
So fuck how your livin'
I'm the unforgivin'
Psycho driven
Murdera
It's authentic
Don't panic
I can't stand it
God damn it
Scizophrenic
So fuck Charlie Manson
I'll snatch him out his truck
Hit 'em with a brick
And I'm dancin


Mass Murderer, Natural Born Killla,
And I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna
I don't wanna die!


I don't understand the logic in my dreams
But I understand I like the sounds of sireens
Terrified screams from the streams of Strychnine
Dumpin' on any motherfucker tryin' to trick mine
Cause punk motherfuckers wanna violate
Now they stiff and cold
And they pupils won't dilate
Its so much pain
Migraine
Headache
I can hear his bones break
He steps in the single door
Got his ass whipped with 20 lashes
Like that dude up in Singapore
So I'm'a pull a fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer
Now I'm suicidal, just like Nirvana


Tic Toc
Toc Tic Toc Tic
Dr. Dre and Ice Cube on some murderin' shit
Keepin' niggaz in order
Makin' their lives shorter
Ready to slaughter
Cause to me a life aint worth a quarter or a dime
Mushroom's got my mind
Hallicinatin
Ain't no debatin'
I'm creatin' an escape
Route to be out without a doubt
Scott Free, so don't even think about tryin' to stop me
Cause I cant wait
I'm out the gate
On the for realla
A thrilla
Or a natural born killa


Gi-Gi Gi-Gi Gaga
They call me da-da
6 million ways to murder
Choose one
Lose one soul
Bodies turn cold
Natural fright from niggaz goin' bump in the night...

Should I peel 'er ( yeah)
Should I kill her in my iller ( hell yeah)
Then a Natural Born Killa

Should I peel 'er ( yeah)
Should I kill her in my iller ( hell yeah)
Then a Natural Born Killa

Should I peel 'er ( yeah)
Should I kill her in my iller ( hell yeah)
Then a Natural Born Killa
