(Get that dough)
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, C'mon
(Get that dough)
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro
(Get that dough)
Look wipe a bitch down, let's dribble on a hoe, Wooo
(Get that dough)
Let's pop a few bottles, smoke a lil dro


I pull up slow, chrome flashin
lil daddy in a long Cabbi
Big hat pimp strong daddy
Got my hoes on my arm daddy
Ain't that amazing, specially when I'm blazin that dro
earthly green, purple weed, purple V,
with purple seats, murck the streets
And I see ya in that Gucci skirt ya sweet
But later on I wanna hurt ya so holla back hoe
I know ya will, get ya ass over here
And take off my polar bear
I'm the coldest player of most my age
Quote my age, 19 but my money's much old
And shorty got crazy paper
Cash Money's my army, my navy paper
Understand, Weezy is made of paper
I got "Baby" paper




Floss our bitch, or get tossed out
Stunna time criss-crossed out
Birdman the bad bitches bossed out
So fly nigga we dont walk out
Time to get Nina Rossed out
I'ma let the heat speak, see I'm talked out
What's the muthafuckin talk bout
Get you niggaz chalked out
Chi-town and Birdman show you what that fuckin hawk bout


You can shine like stunna (Papi it's all gravy)
I bought the Rover for me and bought the Benz for my ladies
See I, wipe ya down, I shine ya up
And put the rims on the whip then diamonded up
It's the m-uh-m-uh-man, that I hustle for grams
Me, Ta', and Cris' with a blunt in my hand
See I come through shinin, known big tymin
Red Caddi truck, nigga I'm grindin




I come Harley D, black bike all chrome
Your queen is home, daddy tell 'em where they went from


See I'ma slide on through, then I stash the loot
Who washed the coupe, ma look I know what to do


Got the suit you to wear some pumps on
matchin the car, matchin my bra, shit nigga pimpin is hard


I jock that, so wipe a nigga down
Let's dribble on a hoe, bitch time to go


The Caddi do me pop, the coupe is hot
the groupies flock, and case me out my Gucci socks
Yeah, we get that dough, Tatee' watch me drop these
You got me, can I get the car keys


See I wipe a bitch down, then dribble on a hoe
And I touch her from her head, from her waist, to her toes
Pop up in the Lexus with the mink on the floor
Rocked out Nexus 2K bird hoe, Wooo!
