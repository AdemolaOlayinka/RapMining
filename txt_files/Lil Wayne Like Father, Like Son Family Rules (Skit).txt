Now the rules of the family has nothing to do with the outside world. 

The outside world don't count here this is an inner circle of our family,
what we say goes.

Anybody anyplace else that disrespects you deal with us,
if you're with us you're with us, and that's it,
that's the way it goes, there's no such thing
as an outsider comming in, we don't let no one in,
we use all of them to do our dirty work,
and they come in they do our dirty work and that's just the way it is.
your Family is your life that's what it is life and death.
