Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh
Hollygrove, Hollywood,
Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go
Straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets
What's in your pocketbook
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove,
Too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's
So good, need a name
Call it milk, because
Milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better
Monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and
Pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full
Hollygrove, Hollywoood,
Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Woo
I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill
And heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say let's make a film
I be like action
I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you get your family killed
That's if you squeal
Pop-pop close range hold that gun
Like the photographer
Hold the camera still
Bad bitch ridin my dick
She swerve cause another
Bitch grabbin the wheel
I ask 'em to chill
They both look at me say shut up
I say my lips are sealed
Oooh
I come from Hollygrove,
I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in heaven
When hell was a pile of wood
I run through hell
With gasoline drawers on
Stop tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove
Everyday Halloween
We shoot your block up
And just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery
I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast
Since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi
I need my privacy
Fuck yo' photography
I react violently
Make sure your camera
Get my good side of me
Lawwwd
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make
A movie 'bout Hollygrove
Whoo
Whoever play me should get
A Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain't no movie
This is real shit
I don't need a script
'Cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort
More coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got superstar
Written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood
Just to californicate
Bapapapapapapapa
I ain't finna shoot and
Tell 'em don't check the gate
Hollygrove, Hollywood,
Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood,
Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove,
My bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say hallelujah
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh but I done went Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood,
Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and
Forth with the work prayin
Lord please don't
Let this car break down

H-Town
Lawwd
I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th ward bitch that be boostin
Sometimes she doze off
That's the lean I excuse it
She said if it ain't
Chopped and screwed
It ain't music
She say I never take her out
We went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off that's
The lean I'm just snoozin
I still got Actavis
Nigga that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes
I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life had
To do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back
And forth with the work
Praying the car don't break down
Ohhh
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with
Codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you
Don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word
But I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn
I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms
And a head like a octopus
I got this chopper
Protecting my livelihood
I'm so good
I'm so straight
I'm secure
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Cut
