LL Cool J

2006)
My 12th album launched
Now everything is carte blanche
There's only one God
Victory is all I want, let's go


Ah one-two and uh, ah one-two and uh
Juelz, it's LL and (Santana)
Ah one-two and uh, ah one-two and uh
Juelz, it's LL and (Santana)
You witnessin history!
(To my homies who get it and get it the fast way)
(To my ladies who get it and get it so nasty)
To my baby mommas that like it real flashy
Can't wait to smash me (all they do is harass me)


Check it, I stay in smoke filled Benzes
Don't see nothin, you know the whole world's tinted
OZM so po'-po' don't sing sing
My license and registration is good, go check it
It cost to be the boss, it cost for me to floss
Of course you see the frost - got diamonds on my neck
I'm the, big skipper, big dipper, big pot
Big whipper, just watch, big rocks, big flipper - ya dig?
Big money, big spender, big getter
Big hustler, big grinder, do you get the big picture - ya dig?
Dis is a, club banger, trunk hopper
Block rocker, rude bwoy, top shotter
Ay! This is for my down South trappers
My midwest slabbers - ya dig?
Ay! Yup yup, this is for my East coast slangers
My West coast bangers - ya dig?




VV9 Vanquishes
Never lunchin, I hit your honey with these languages (I'm about that)
Warto, Bertaliano, Cancerilli{?}
Neck shinin, my diamonds purple as grape jelly (I'm about that)
Thorough get yo' bread perspective
Don't forget to set your Tivo, my my game's perfected (I'm about that)
Rainbow ice, you confidant talk politely
Leave the party with your wifey, so don't invite me
Bang one of them joints from New Orleans
Juvey hustle harder, Birdman you still boring
Northside (Ch-ch-ch-choppin the ? of my gold rims)
Southside (Ch-ch-ch-choppin the ? of my gold rims) - you about that?
How I'm beamin in the Beemer
Bounce wit'cha honey have you singin "Have you seen her?"
Uhh, have you seen her
L put in work, gospel - church!
