Lil Wayne
Dedication 3
2008)
Yea yea uh huh 
She said FUCK FENDI, but I think she was playin 
I heard she move dem thangs 
I think she fuckin Wayne 
She call herself Lewinsky, dat mean she give him brain 
She trynna be like Lil Kim, her picture looks da same 
Y she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens rite? 
And wats her nationality, she chinese rite? 
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT 
She ain't da next bitch, tell dat bitch FALL BACK! 
See I'm a hata, I go hard... listen let's begin 
U kno her last name Minaj, she a lesbian 
And she ain't neva comin out, look at currency 
But every time she do a interview you kno I run to see 
She get me so sick it make me vomit 
Dats why I spend my time online leaving comments 
And you kno dat I got some more haters with me 
Might hit up thisis50, MTV, hit up BET 
Tell 'em pretty pretty please don't play Nicki 

 
Still I rise 
Still I fight 
Still I mite crack a smile 
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI! 
One day u'll remeber dis 
One day wen we reminese 
Nuthin I do ever is, good enuff 4 da music biz 

For you, for you 

 
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket 
U c a bad bitch gettin shine, you should luv it 
Cause everytime a door opens 4 me dat means you 
Jus gotta a betta opportunity 2 do you 
Dey don't understand dese labels look at numbas is statistics 
I lose, you lose, mines jus legastic 
Ne way, real bitches listen wen I'm speakin 
Cause if nicki win, den all of ya'll gettin meetns (chyea) 
Ask LA Reid, ask Jay 
Den hit up Universal, see wat Sylvia Rhone say 
Ask Craig Common, you can ask chris 
Ladi wen your done, just salute bad bitch 
Onli underground bitch around dats duckin da paparatzi 
In & outta town, be swirvin da mazeratzi 
Stay around da white like a nazi 
Pussy pa-pa-poppin on my car so da cops see... BITCHES! 

 
Still I rise 
Still I fight 
Still I mite crack a smile 
Keep my eyes on da prize, see my haters tell 'em HI!

One day wen we reminese 
Nuthin I do ever is, gud enuff 4 da music biz
