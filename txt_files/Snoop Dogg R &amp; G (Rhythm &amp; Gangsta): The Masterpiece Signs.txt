I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (OHHH!!!)


Don't think about it, boy leave her alone
(Ooh wee!!) Nigga you ain't no G!
She likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!


It's legit, you know it's a hit
When The Neptunes and the Doggy Dogg fin to spit
You know he's in - tune with the season
Come here baby, tell me why you leaving?
Tell me if it's weed that you needing
You wanna breathe? I got the best weed minus seeds
Ain't nobody tripping VIP they can't get in
If something go wrong then you know we get to Cripping


I'm not sure what I see
You better don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys

Now you stepping wit a G, from Los Angeles
Where helicopters got cameras, just to get a glimpse of our Chucks
And our Khakis and our bouncer cars
You wit you friend right? (yeah)
She ain't trying to bring over no men right? (no)
Shiieet, she ain't gotta be in the distance
She could get high all in an instant

You better don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?

Mami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s
From London - to Ibiza. You gotta have Cape Town
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena
And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)


Nigga don't be young and foolish
You don't know what you're doing
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)
And her pretty face, drove you wild
But you ain't got that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style


I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck wit me!
Are you telling me this is a sign?
She's looking in my eyes, now I see no other guys
Are you telling me this is a sign? (OHHH!!!)

She likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll (hey!) you ain't no G!
(Ooh wee!!) You ain't no G! (oh oh ohh! .. Ooh wee!!)
