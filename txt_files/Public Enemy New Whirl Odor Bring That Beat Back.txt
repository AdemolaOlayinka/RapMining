Public Enemy
New Whirl Odor
2005)
Played in cincinatti
Wit my whole head nappy
Made a rally in the street
Wit nothin but a beat
Gotta grudge against a judge
Kick em out that seat
You are what you eat
So what you eatin
Same message to your mind
Be self defeatin
Sick n tired of bein sick
And tired of bein beaten
Saw em drop it like it 
Was way too hot and too fast
For hip hop doo wop rock or bop
Aint here to hurt you
Dont hang in them circles
Government aint got me
Yet so yall dont stop me
See a stampede of fake cats
Runnin from bill cosby
What does he gotta do wit you doin you?
Yall know what?
Dj lord gimme that cut
Bring that beat back
Thats whats up


Feedback from truly 
Freedblacks
Gotta think outta this
Box of hard knocks
Lined em up at fort knox
To die in iraq
You dont know i rock?
What you under a rock?
Old cats beggin us to bring that beat back
Each generation thinks
The next one is wack
Jumpstarted in the daze of crack
R&b reagan, daddy bush
Way the hell on back
Pray to god
Feel like i got a church in myself, good god uh
Cant get no help
I say again healthcare cutback
Sht is wack
Bring that beat back 


They say the youth dont matter
And the old dont mind
It takes a lotta spine
To build all them young minds

Some of us get ghetto at the wrong damn time
Album what? we just makin one at a time
To save another brother whose life on the line
A big shot to claim some rocks and shine
Signs of a soul gone solo 
Robbed blind
A very small part of half the worlds crime
Runaway child blown by an old land mine
Little ones workin in diamond mines

So cats can say whats hers and whats mine
Diamonds is girls best friend 
So whys he cryin


See when yall hear it get near it
And you recognize the lyrics
You trained to refrain
And you start to fear it
Escapism
Like today there aint racism
Obviously yall aint see
Black folks on tv
Judgement calls 
Made on behalf of you and me
Or you and i
Do or die
I say an i for an i
Dividin line
Got the poor people 
Payin for crime
Corporations gettin paid off our jailtime
Now yall can tell russell
Yes i knock the hustle
Cause 2 million in lockdown
Under federal muscle
Beyond the streets 
These kids is always watchin
Watching some of these jerks when they go berserk
So i work
