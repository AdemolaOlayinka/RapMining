Floss time, Busta Rhymes shine on every primetime
Mastermind gettin this paper now cross the fine line
Money plenty sippin gently with the Bentley
My Bentley runneth over empty what gifts you sent me
Then you broke the last rule, frontin like we was mad cool
You damn fool, come around frontin wearin your man's jewels
WHOO!  Play the part, they want me to start shit
Get on your mark quick and target, corner the market
Peep how we're movin this, keep improvin this
See you in this because you love the way me and my crew be doin this
Have a ball, I'm not mad at ch'all, where the alcohol
I ain't messin with you at all, girl your ass too small
Cop the hot shit, write it off while you bite it off
and try to fight it off, you're faggot you wack and your light is off
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us

Barbeque back at the mansion, feel like a champion
Collapse on, my thing orthapedic to rest your back on
Nowadays Flipmode money be runnin mad North
Fuck around, dig in my treasure, feel my forty-five long
Ride through, about to slide through, I'm right beside you
Mind you, my system be bangin, adjust my EQ

Powerful, we predisential, we BOMB your mental

HIT ME OFF, you Speak'n'Spell and freak it well
so no need to dwell, check in the mirror, my pockets swell
Shit sound so intermediate, my ingredient
is to immediately rep for everyone you see me with
You little eedyot, I exile you and your X-File
You and your next trial, and demolish your little rap style
Black child, I'm takin offensive, we too impressive
To the naked eye, the way we floss sure be expensive
OOOH!  Run up the fader, ain't nuttin greater
Still a little hater be gettin paper go meet your maker
Undertaker now go shake whatcha momma gave ya
Shake-a shake-a now we trippin the circuit breaker
Model up and swallow up and turn the throttle up
Break the bottle up in the hip with the greatest follow up
Bite the dust, you like to fuss, look right at us
I know you like to cuss, who could you trust to bring the rush?
Now do the..
