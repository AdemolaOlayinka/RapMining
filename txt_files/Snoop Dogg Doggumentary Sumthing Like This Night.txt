Doggumentary
2011)
Top selector number one Big Snoop D-O-double-G, ya!
Come again, bo, bo!
There's somethin 'bout this night
Somethin 'bout this light, yahhhhh

Illa dilla, I'ma killer
Snoopy Dogg with the Gorillaz
Layin low, on the flo'
My hands up high, I'm full of 'dro
Girlies tryin to kiss me slow
I'm leanin like a sixty-fo'
This life I live's incredible
These trees I breeze are medical
Take a look, in my eyes
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride
If you don't feel good then you out of place
My universe, is outer space
My look, my style, my Prada case
Lil' daddy get out our face
Trip this, sip this, hit that, now sit on back
And let Dogg go and get on that
Party people you invited

Have you ever tried it... somethin like this night
I can try to smoke wit'chu, somethin like this night
Have you ever tried it... somethin like this night
I can try to smoke wit'chu, somethin like this night
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night

What a night to get involved
Everybody have a pause
Celebrate and fill your cup
Drink until you get enough
How you feel, I got that feelin
Disco lights hang from the ceiling
Ain't nobody on the wall
Pop it, drop it, let that fall
Hey DJ, play my song
Step back, let it bang all night long
I need your attention, no hopin or wishin
Come in in high-definition
Said I do, right that I do
Get up and get money, yep that I do
Rode it, ride it, lick it
Bite it, roll it, ride it
Party people you invited

 Party people you invited

Somethin like this night, somethin like this 
Somethin like this night, somethin like this night
