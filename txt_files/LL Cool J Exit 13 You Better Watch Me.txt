Oh, y'all wanna go to the nineties?
Y'all wanna go retro?
That's what we doin?
Oh that's one of my specialties


(get busy y'all)
You better watch me 


Let's get it poppin
They like this boy rotten
I'm like I better pick ? then pick cotton
And sometimes gotta see cats to blow
I was blessed with that 20/20 vision fa sho
See its 20 mil a year 20 years in a row
First 20 mil came when i was 20 years old
I average right around 20% on my dough
Fast farward 20 years then compare my flow
Difference is i own mine and you still owe
Slackin in your mackin cant save a hoe
Spekulatin at the bar over mohetoe
Like I betchya fall off, oh no he won't
So I so spit better, oh no he don't
Under 20 ass 50 if you feelin to go 
Over 30 ass Rakim i ain't no joke
I'm dirty his jaws drop off wicked and went 


(get busy y'all)
You better watch me 


Still bangin both, still hangin
Look like a - thank got its still rainin
I'm light on my feet, you can't judge me by the weigh-in
I'ts hard to grasp some of the shit i be sayin
It flys over your head like a second string is
You can't comprehend me 
You couldnt place a decimal on the paper im makin
Fly man cant appreciate on castles creation
No wonder y'all keep hatin
Is L really ? young boy's debatin'
You play johnny ? I'll keep on cakin'
You can't compare me to them line for line
I'm beyond that I represent ? of time
Classic my style can't be defined
I'll be relavent forever, get it through your mind
Just watch me

Two steppin in the club
With my L in the air
And a bottle of bub

Cause we back on top, ain't nobody this high
