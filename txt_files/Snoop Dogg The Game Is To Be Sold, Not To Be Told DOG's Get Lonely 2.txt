Look here babygirl D.O.G.'s we get lonely
You can ask all my homies, all D.P.G. got tenderoni's
Now when we on the road trying to get this paper
and phone call away is what you say
But some times you got to find time to get up
to get out and get away You feel me
Now all I want to do is stay real and stay true
I'm trying to have a little something, and keep you satisfied, but 
(when) my homeboys say its time to ride then I'm a ride
See I'm a gangsta I'm a always be a gangsta you cant change me
Dispite at night I might get lonely ya heard me come and serve me
I'd love to take you to the mall

If thats what you want to do, thats what you trying to do

cause I got to get this cheese with my crew
But baby momma full of drama aint that right
