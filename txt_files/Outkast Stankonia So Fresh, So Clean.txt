Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)


Sir Luscious got gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorado's I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Ralo
So follow it's showtime at the Apollo
Minus the Kiki Shepard what about a ho in a leopard-print
Teddy Pendergrass cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left my throat warm in the dorm room at the AU
We blew hay too, athletes might take you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
Cause




Canary yellow, '79 Seville is on display
My nigga Bungle whipped it up so I gone get my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the honeycomb hideout
I'm gonna show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snippas
YKK on yo zippa lick you like a lizard
When I'm slizzard or sober 6 million ways to fold ya
Like Noah I get twos of you and you get pretty deep
But I'll call yo ass round 8-ish I know you'll be there for me
Cause




Those huge baby eyes get to running off at they mouth
Tellin me everything that's on yo nasty mind
They say your malnutrition in need of vitamin D
And inviting me to that tingle in yo spine
I love who you are I love who ya ain't you're so Ann Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James and no chains and whips I do suck lips
Till hips jerk and double time the boy next door's a freak
Ha Ha



(And we are...) the coolest motherfuckers on the planet
(In my mind...) the sky is falling ain't no need to panic
(But Oh oh.....) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh...) Compatible created in the attic
