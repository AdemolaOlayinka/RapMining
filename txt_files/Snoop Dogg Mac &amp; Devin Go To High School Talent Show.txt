Snoop Dogg
Mac &amp; Devin Go To High School
2011
I been trying to develop an alternative fuel
from a mix of all natural substances.
But the mix was highly volatile until we find a catalyst
to help stabilize the compound and supercharge the fuel.
(I'm sorry, what was this magical catalyst?)
 Marijuana motherfucker!

Uh, ladies and gentlemen, players and playettes
Teachers, staff and students
I am very honored to welcome you to the high school annual talent show
Brought to you by the makers of Wiz Khalifa Premium Rolling Papers
And the qualified rollers of Snoop Dogg Master Kush
So without further adieux, let's get this show on the road
First contestant, bring your talent to the foreground
and let your smoke be yo' background

Every time I go out, I'm blowin the smoke out
I buy it don't even know the price
I smoke cause I live it, don't pay me to visit
And I'll be somewhere up in the sky
My nigga it's 'bout to go dowwwwwn
Ohh we fly, it's no lie, that we high, 'til we die
I'ma get up in this hoe's houuuuuse
Roll one up, clean the ride case them hoes wan' jump inside

Uhh, got a joint filled with quality shit
My bottom bitch smokin with me, niggaz talk shit
All of 'em shrimp (hehe) I'm a big fish
Roll a joint, lick it once, tell you hit this, groupies on my dick
Several kush is on my hitlist, in and out these niggaz bitches
Smokin tree and not to mention hustlin, tryin to mind my business
You probably went to class while I was in the hallway skippin
Yeah I hear what they sayin, just be too high to listen
'Bout my money trippin, if I even fold it wrong
Ya ain't smokin this good, if it's foul tell you I sold it all
Or wait 'til one of my hoes come 'round and roll it all
Or say fuck it and cuff it 'til I go smoke with Dogg
I show off, I show off, I show off
Car push to start, hit the button once it go off
Keep the money comin in and the papers rolled up
And ain't worried 'bout a hatin nigga, they get no love (ohh)


I go green like I was Archbishop Don Juan
And blow circles 'round you suckas like a marathon
My gym teacher told me, but I didn't listen
My bitch did my homework and now I'm in detention
It sho' beats suspension, this is my audition
So play yo' position, get the picture I envision
Did she mention, Snoop Dogg was made for kissin
A barricuda fishin, she on a mission for me
Pleasure, pain and glory, and my inventory
My SAT's, my lil' bitch she did 'em for me
And now we prancin on stage at the talent show
We floss in my clothes, my chain and my knapsack
Full of that, hand me that, can you see my telescope
Principle, said she wanna see me cause she smell my smoke
'Bout my money trippin even if I fold it wrong
Blowin zones with Wiz cause this is the protocol


Yeah, it's the Archbishop Don "Magic" Juan
It's a talent show, and everybody got to know
You got to be ready so you don't have to get ready
So when I stepped in, for the talent show
I had stole the show, because I was already ready
Everybody shoulda know they part
because the whole world is the stage, and everybody play a part
So when you at the talent show, you got to know yo' part
And you got to know when to move, and when not to move
And by me being a famous player, and know my game
I took the talent show, because I had style
I had flash, I had originality!
I had me, and that's what it's all about!
When you doin a talent show, you got to be you!
Green for the money, gold for the honey
I'm the original...
