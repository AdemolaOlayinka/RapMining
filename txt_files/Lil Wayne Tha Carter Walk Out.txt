And I also got a large pot of cigarette or you, that
Embalmment fluid illiterate are you

Got that vitamin D R U G for you shorty
One window to let the dawn in
Cause we hustle in this bitch midnight to morning
We dump in and pump out
I showed you this window for you to jump out
You on the backyard lawn where a nigga got the ganja growing
No cats or dogs, rats or snakes, Sam's or Jakes
Round here its all gravy, ham and steak
Mama cooking that up here have a plate
That's mama Carter she's a basket case
But I make sure her sandwich is a napkins straight
You pic wit this picnic and I'm at your face
I say I'm at your throat, this was the carter slam the door, go
