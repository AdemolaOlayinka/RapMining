The Notorius B.I.G
Ready To Die
1994)
Uh, uh, check it out
Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh, um
I like this, yeah
Uh, yeah, 94' keep banging

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies?
The back of the club, sipping MoÃ«t, is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question asking, blunt passing, music blasting
But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the EP a secret. Why not?
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me, sweety, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy. I got mad friends with Benzs
C-notes by the layers, true fucking players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3,
I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby
Baby

Straight up, honey. Really, I'm asking
Most of these niggaz think they be mackin but they be acting
Who they attracting with that line, "What's your name, what's your sign"?
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with,
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial.
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo. True
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi, smoke Ls while you do me

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby
Baby

How ya living Biggie Smallz?
In mansion and Benzs
Giving ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams. What?
Chopping Os, smoking lye and Optimos
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Gucci sweater now
Drop top BMs I'm the man girlfriend
Honey, check it, check it
Tell your friends, to get with my friends, your friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend. That's right
Aight? Is that aight with you?
Yeah... keep banging

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honies getting money playing niggaz like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place! Why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby
Baby

Uh, check it out,
My full shit, for that ass,
Uh, Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls, 
Junior M.A.F.I.A., represent baby bay-bay!
Uh!
