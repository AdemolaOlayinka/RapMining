Hip Hop Is Dead
2006)
Uh, light somethin', 
stop frontin' 
how much money's enough, think maybe like a trillion' figures 
pray my daughter don't wild like them Hilton sisters, 
that'd kill me yo, filthy rich, my daughter pass it onto the next generation, 
throwin' carnations 
at my tombstone, 
in my new home, 
meet mom's in my east st. laurent suit on, 
then we do a dance like my man 
luther dan, 
but my verse came first, 
i stole change out her purse, 
now i wanna dig her up outta the earth, 
two more but lean forward, toward a new paragraph, 
blue carrots, D-class, 
strictly that Kush in the weed bags, 
tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie (?) had, 
put in production, 
studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin, 
hit a spliff through a seance, 
and I, play on playa 

 
Finest females, i spit game on, i spray tha, gotta' get your papes on, playa on playa,
before it's all gone, sip don, tip weight up, do y'all thing when i swing, baby,
spend dub's on yeh rugs(?), gotta' live crazy, 
finest females, i spit game on, i spray tha, get your papes on,
playa on playa, get your papes on, play on playa, get your papes on..uh 


Ruby red grapefruit juice 
with grey goose, 
rubies in the Jesus 
piece, 
pimped out like Snoopy, 
but a East Coast thing, 
my girl's stocking, 
tied up in a knot top a' my beanhead, 
billion dollar dream head, 
went from triple beams to digitals, 
servin' fiends to minimal, 
sixty g's no criminal, 
no mo', 
jus mo' doe, 
my motions pouring, 
Oprah's earrings, 
on fingers while your girl performs cunning lingas, 
cause' there's big money a rumour lingers, 
barber cleans his blade, 
then they give me a fade, 
hot towel on the face, 
hot models who vommit after they eat so they can stay lightweight,
swallowin' my protein like an ovaltine shake, 
come thru' like mo green from Godfather, 
so clean where i step i 'Clorox it', 
keep twenty g's on both sides of the thighs, 
that's four pockets, eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price, 
but we ain't into buyin' conflict ice, 
that's the shit they stole from the Congo, 
and other block soil, 
true mack foil, 
nappy hair jus spinnin', 
hunny gave me a massage with the happy ending, 
finest females i jus came on, 
and sprayed uh, gotta get yeh papes on, play on playa 




It's kinda hard for a playa like you, 
but let me show you how a nigga like me, get revenue, 
what ya never do 
is punk out whatchu better do, 
never let the game get ahead of you, 
get a better view, 
better yet, a better clue, 
praise God, imma marry you, 
get your hoe to, carry you, 
bury you, 
slowly, roll me another blunt, 
stuff it, 
lick it, 
puff it, 
tuck it, 
fuck it, 
that man, 
that game, 
that thang 
it busts, 
in D.O Double G we trust! 
yup, yup, young roll with the two steps, 
he creepin' with tha two tec's, 
they sleepin' with two chicks, 
right before we blast all you heard was two clicks, 
end of existence, 
for instance, 
rewind, 
replay it, 
re-chop it, 
remix it, 
we twist it, 
goddamn D.O Double G, cuz we missed it, 
travel slow, 
im an indian, but not a navajo, i 
smoke the big leaf 
end all the big beefs, 
my hair in two braid's, im the big chief, 
ladda da' beep bah baddda! 
yeah, break that down, how fresh yeh are, 
the king from Queens, Mr.Escobar, 
connect with the best from the west, yes yes, yah are, 
oh my god, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas, 
playa play on, play on, play on,  play on, play on, play on
