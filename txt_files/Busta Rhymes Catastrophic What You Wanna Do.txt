Busta Rhymes
Catastrophic
with The Conglomerate)
Yeah
Yeah
Watch me

Look, ok, J-Doe in up in the damn box
You might even drop a shit on anything hot
Encore if it's R&B or reggae if it's pop
When it come to hip-hop nigga I got a lock
I don't fuck with haters just how I don't fuck with cops
I learned on my block when I see your own talk
A hundred chicks is calling me, they follow me and Flox
Young nigga coming from the bottom to the top
They love it, bad bitches in my front row
They crushin, I tell em come up to the penthouse
They Russian, them Grammies and plaques on the wall
Don't touch em, why you callin me baby in the bed
With this fuckin, yea I'm buzzin in the street, I got em blushing in the cheeks
I'm telling every bitch I meet oh yea you fuckin with a beast
Okay it's nothing to a G, I'm getting money, can't you see?
They can't, nobody fuck with me
And if you think you can then wuchu wanna do?

What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
Okay, what you gon' say?
What you gon' do?
When I see your girls
Comin' for you
(I'm just a smooth ma'fucka)
She ain't gon' say no
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?
What you gonna do? What you gonna do?

Okay, if we get closed, that's the thing you're standing next to
Don't be actin cool, nigga I ain't never met you
I'm a whip that ass, ain't nobody gonna rescue
You ain't gotta sneeze for me to bless you
Yea I had no girl, then I used her like a restroom
On my line every day and she don't even text you
She can stay over here, that's how niggas from the west do
Even if she go sleep over, she stay in the guest room
Yea I'm whippin niggas ass on this microphone shit
And I'm filin no trends, bitch I'm on my own shit
Niggas in this industry be walkin on that clone shit
Gotta pay attention to the niggas you do songs with
I ain't letting whack ass half ass rappers
Get up on no song with me, that's working ass rackots
No one gotta take it with me up in this damn thang
And if you got a problem nigga that's what numbers say
Aye, what you gonna do?
