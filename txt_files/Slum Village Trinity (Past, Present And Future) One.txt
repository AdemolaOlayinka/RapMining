(One, one..) Don't fuck it up! (One)
It only takes (One)
so feel it y'all (One)
Now every (One)
It only takes (One)
You only need (One)
So feel it y'all (One)
We're number (One)
You're not number (One)
It only takes (One)
So feel it y'all (One)
It only takes, to click clack the gun on 'em
To bring drama to 'em like Dee Witt we runnin' em
One, drama 'n I get the gun out the couch, run out the house
With the loaded pistol stuck in his crouch - One
You fuck it up for all of the rest
You n your niggas in the parking lot rollin' the cess
Tryin' to get up in some chickens that all in your shit
They all wit it, and all seem down to get it, except One
She ain't feelin' the crew
Plus she got a man she don't like niggas like you
She said you fuck wit the niggas, you know how they do
We roll out, 'cause we see another we another set of dudes
So one - minute later, hear some shots in the air
Niggas duckin' on the ground like guerilla warfare
Fuckin' up a niggas groove and when they know it ain't fair
He roll out with his niggas and his hands in the air
Singin' One  (one, one, one, one)

It only takes (One)
To rock it y'all (One)
You only need (One)
To do it y'all (One)
It takes, one, tragedy to bring a family closer
One bullet to start a war and be a part of gore
These hoes trick and be on crack like a slightly parted door
It took one hit, tongue kiss and make cum quick
It took one hit, for a wack rapper to make millions
Causing the illest niggas to switch and spit what they ain't feelin'
One! Day a time of alcohol it takes to get by
Is worth more than a mini puff it takes to get high
One, Love was the joint that my cousins used to breakdance to
Before they began to pop and lock with the glock handle
This -one- turn for the worst, my main concern for the earth
'Cause it seems to get even worse when it turns
Purposely burn an emcee, fricasee his hand holding the mic
So he can't fold it to write
I'm potent as a lightning bolt when it strike
At least - one - feelin' me
Come through ya city with sign and drown ya energy - One!
One, one, one, one

Now every (One)
It only takes (One)
You only need (One)
So feel it y'all (One)
One of the best in the class it's so stupid
One who test it's tragic so don't do it
Group move crowds like they had us do with theme music
Spit like cars when the body releasin' fluid
One, more tragic than ninety-one-one
Also we fearsome
Known as the Slum and that's just one organism
One crew comin' through 'cause we gotta hit 'em
Those dudes too fly like the Continental
Two niggas on the side one up the middle
It's love in the club and it's constant
We drop shit and yell shit at the concerts

One...two...the whole world is
Tick tock, tick tock
You live by the clock but I move faster
Niggas is sleeping 'cause they thinking that I procrati-nate
One of these days I'm a show you what I'm made of
Soon as I'm done with these silly little rap scrubs
Soon as I'm done making my rap million dollar hits
Soon as I'm done cleaning my soul of this old curse
Soon as I'm one with the universe
I'm done with you little fucks in this little earth
I rule a planet of my own where you don't exist
Everything is One
