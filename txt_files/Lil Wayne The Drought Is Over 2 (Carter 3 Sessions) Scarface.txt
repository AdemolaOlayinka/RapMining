Lil Wayne
The Drought Is Over 2 (Carter 3 Sessions)
2007)
All I have in this world
All I have in this world (what up blood)

They know where carter at straight off the launching pad
Marching on the moon motherfucker I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats
Jumping in something from other countries companies junkie you cannot order that
I flew that into the water back order
Go to iraqget a car with
And tell them crackers war with that
All I need is an automatic tick boom
I'm a goon I go zoom
Smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young toon in the room gimme room
All you doomed I am soon
To get all my chips and the blooms
I would never be another groom
Unless I assume the bitch ain't giving up the womb
To him and whom
M.o.b. let me boom let me boom
I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm getting my lunch like noon I gotta eat
Scarface with diamond teeth (hah)

On the for reala my nigga just call me scarface
On the for reala my nigga just call me scarface
On the for reala my nigga just call me scarface
Nobody knew my name they only knew my face
On the for reala my nigga just call me scarface
Nobody knew my name they only knew my face
On the for reala my nigga just call me scarface
(laaaawd)

Protect me from my friends I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry world but my mommy taught me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me you'd probably catch some sick disease
6 degrees leaning on that pro methahazene
I'm a centipede these men move at women speed
I'm bout my spinach chesse dough cheddar feddi gwop money moolah mozzarella exetera exetera
Fuck competitors fuck these rappers fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state fuck the gates who running the prisoners
These motherfuckers who pray I'm the predator see me dreadlock
Tough as bam bam from bedrock
I'm tied to the game like wedlock
Say hello red dot say good bye life and say hello Satan
A devil in the flesh a rebel at its best
No complaining we live in hell and I'm blessed scarface
