Lil Wayne
No Ceilings
2009)
Rock star lifestyle might not make it,
President got him in the White House naked,
Looked at the clock and it said right now,
Get a pound break it down, blow it like trial,
Pelle tele dutche, wine in my tall glass,
Young Money baby, big shit like a horse ass,
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back,
Bugatti matte black, where they do that at?
South beach Miami hoe, I'm probably with tammy toe,
My life is a video and the women want they cameo,
I just want them panties hoe & I'm higher than geranimo,
And I got them tools, tell em boys to get mechanical,
Now pop that pussy like a four four,
I turn her round and bend her over like a low blow,
It's Young Money baby, we the fucking greatest,
We don put the other niggas on a hiatus,
Beat ya bitch with a pump if she deny data,
Cause I'll serve anyone like a blind waiter,
I'll make my girl cum first then I'll arrive later,
I shake your pussy's up, I'm her vibrator, haha,
Keep getting money like hell yeah,
This shits so good it don't even smell bad,
And you can tell dad, that I'm muthafucker,
You niggas bet not slip, ice road truckers,
Like Paul Barrow, choppa stupid long,
New Orleans nigga, I get super Dome,
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me,
We on nigga, let let them hoes know,
Young Money lay em down like old folks,
You coming with it, we coming for it,
Plenty to go around, now watch the money orbit,
Real shit people, now just absorb it,
I try to pay attention but ya'll mad boring,
And I got so much swag I need an ad for it,
And I don't like to brag so my bitches brag for me,
Oh she a good girl, I got her transforming,
She give me hot head, I call it global warming,
If we don't do it dog, let's do it now,
I am more animal then the zoo allow,
Put me in the wild, I'll be there for a while,
You n-ggas little league, call em Curaco*,
Energizer money, it keep going,
I'm laid up, I'm free throwing,
Who rebounding, who gives a shit,
Fuck dat, I got 27 years of this,
Hit or miss, I hit your misses,
You are local news, I'm 60 minutes,
I hit the target, I hit the witness,
I work out in my office, guess I'm fit for business,
Too many visions, completed missions,
Still icin out crosses, keep it christian
We consistent, the streets commend it,
Weezy F baby, the F is for Forensics,
From start to finish, Usain Wayne,
Ok ya doing your thing,
The things change, you plain Jane,
I'm diverse, I say the World second,
And I get high first,
I'm a mind freak, check my time sheet,
Bitch I bring the noise, where the lions sleep,
Your flow never wet, like grandma pussy,
I'm always good, like grandma cookies,
Yeah call me the screen or the swine fixer,
It's going down like the Catalina wine mixer,
She going down like the hands on my time ticker,
I'm always strapped, Vietnam nigga,
We are fine nigga, like Amber Rose,
We ball nigga, like Jalen Rose,
Better tell them hoes,
I got a million flows,
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes,
Young Money baby,
And the building grows as we look up,
Where did the ceilings go?
