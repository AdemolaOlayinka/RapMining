Outkast
Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
1994)
Let me take you on a funky ride 
All around the world 
And ahh, if you let me give inside your mind 
Feel your spirits fly 



Oh baby, would you like to take a little ride with me 
Unleash your sexual fantasies 
It would be so nice 
Ahh, relax your body next to me 
As I sing this OutKast melody 
On this funky ride 
So just relax baby 





Now baby, now the smoke is in the air 
Montell and Co. has got me there 
And we wonder why you're high? 
Well baby umm, it's nothin but that 
SESS in your CHEST that got you feelin kinda crazy 
So let your spirits fly 
Uhh and enjoy the ride 
Oh yeah baby
