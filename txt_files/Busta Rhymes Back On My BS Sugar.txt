Back On My B.S.
2009)
Hey baby put your hand on my heart tell me if you ever felt a heartbeat like this 


Boom boom boom boom BOOM is the sound that you hear 
From my heart beating hard like a bass drum 
Zoom zoom zoom zoom ZOOM as my blood starts to raise through 
My vains all I wanna is to be close to you 
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do 
Girl let me see those tattoos im gonna ride with you 
Rite here’s the perfect place for me to kiss and f**k you 
I can’t wait to taste your SUGAR


I want to taste your body 
I want to taste your face 
I want to taste your breast taste below your waste 
That’s some of my many wishes 
Fresh out the bubble bath girl you taste so delicious 
From when you leave and go to work and how you blow me kisses 
The way you come back to the crib and cook and wash the dishes 
It’s kinda hard to fight it once the fire is ignited 
You feel my heart beat baby you got me so excited 



I can’t explain the feelin 
It’s such an amazing thing 
You like a prize position 
A gift to any king or wings 
Is only here to protect us 
No matter what we go through 
And how it might affect us 
Tired of the lectures 
A piece to tell me to chill 
But they don’t really understand what im tryin to build 
But I brush it off as nothing 
Baby let me tell you something 
Every single time I see you my adrenalin be rushin 




Your body is smoking like a Newport 
Better yet im backwards 
You like it in the back seat case baby girl your that hood 
I never had it how you put it on me 
The way you move is makin me horny 
Man I just wanna kiss you all over you body stretch you like palates 
Baby lets get naughty do it how we do fuckin all around the house 
Started on the bed ended up on the couch 

Damm I touch you and you touch me 
We get closer and you hold me like your holdin 
On for dear life boldly 
And we go out on the balcony 
And let our bodies wrap up and we fuck 
Until the sun come up housekeepin come and catch us 
I don’t care thou u takin it im givin it we breakin it 
Everything up in the room like a tornado in the makin 
And im wildin and im racing baby let me take you down 
And while you give it to me let me give it back girl listen to the sound as it goes
