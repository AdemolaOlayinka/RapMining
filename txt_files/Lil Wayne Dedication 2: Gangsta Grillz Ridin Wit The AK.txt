They just don't get it till I pop the trunk and come back with it
Barrel on the burner big enough to spit a hundred midgets
I'm from the crescent city moving nothing less than fifty
That's more shells than youll find in the seat
And you don't need to know your alphabets to recognize a G
I'm in the lambo making doughnuts like I work for Krispy Kreme
Excuse my flossin dawg I'm still known to tote a snub
Niggaz thought I lost all my blikas in that Katrina flood

Sometimes you gotta show niggaz better than you can tell them

Burners on the front seat incase a hater come that close
