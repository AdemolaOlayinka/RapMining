Recognize a real dime
When you see one
And don't try to be one
You fuckin peon
I been like dion for eons
You aint nuttin but a biotch
Messed around and let me read up
I come back through and tear the street up
Ice Cube nigga you better D up
And when I come by bitch you better be up
Assss up face in the pillow
I don't give a fizzle got to do my thizzle
The only nizzle that I never ever fizzle
The original
You niggaz know
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up!
Gotta get whichya
Hit you with these things that I'm holdin
Who want to squab with the frozen
Now who want to battle with the chosen
You niggaz lotion, I'm no emotion
I'm shrapnel from the explosion
Hit you in the face while you posin
Hi it's jimmy hendrix
I lined up ten dicks
And took out appendix
So go get forensics
Let em know I'm geronimo
'Till it's my time to go
You better find your ho
Get ya babies and ya mama
And move to guantanimo
Doubt my skills
I'm payin my bills
I'm up in the hills
Ya niggaz are kills
Even though I'm on a FUCKED UP label
You bitches know what I can bring to the table
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up!
This right here is payback from way back I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back I don't play that
This right here is payback from way back I don't play that
I like bitches like you
5'2" wearin light blue
The freak get high too
With a fly doo
Notta erikah badu
That's lookin for a "I do"
Now what can I buy you
Just to try you
Need another bitch to lie to
Need another bitch in my coup
Oh please can I trouble you
For a double scoop
A nigga need some T&A
Now you can get dick but you can't get no DNA
I heard you wuz a big freak (can I hang?)
Bitch looked down, I got some big feet
I like mike & ike's
I like watchin dykes
I like goin to fights
I like earnin my stripes
In the book of life
It's only two women
Big ol good ones
And good ol big ones
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up (come get some!)
You gotta get em up (who wants some?)
You better get em up!
