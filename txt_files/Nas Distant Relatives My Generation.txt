My generation will make a change 
This generation will make a change 
(Yes we will) 
My generation will make a change 
This generation will make a change 
(Do You hear me now) 
My generation will make a change 
This generation will make a change 
(we bout to make a change) 

Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate 
A study hard and save the party for the holidays 
Diplomatic with dem Diploma 
And them bound fi great 
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate 
And then I love the energies whe dem a generate 
My Generation it so special it will make a change 
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate 
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate 
Because we rising up despite of the economy 
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy 
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly 
Because we keep remaining true without apology 
The mission ha to carry through and finish properly 
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe Paris to Napoli 
Say Zambia to Honolulu back to Tripoli 
And everybody want a future living happily 


Can you blame my generation, subjected gentrification, 
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation 
Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing, 
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation 
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent, 
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements 
Whats up with your motto? 
Will you lead? Will you follow? 
Improve your values 
Education is real power 
I reach em like Bono 
So get rid of your self sorrow 
Add some bravado 
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo 
Its truth, that I am you 
And I am proof 
Surviving through 
We do what we gotta do 
Yo we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you 
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school 
Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave 
This generation is destined to do historic deeds. 


uhh if you weather that storm 
Then that rain bring sun 
Been a long time comin 
I know change gone come 
Man I gotta keep it movin to the beat of my drum 
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son 
But they thinkin that my generation gotta die young 
If we all come together then they cant divide one 
Don't worry bout it just be about it 
Got a message from god heaven too crowded 
But I say hey young world you've never looked betta 
And I heard change started with man in the mirror ughh 
This generation 
I'mma represent 
A generation led by a black president 
Now hows that for change 
Who knew that could change 
I don't even look at the flag the same hey ughhh 
So when you finish readin revelations 
Thank god for my generation
