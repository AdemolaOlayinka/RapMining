The motherfuckin world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle..
.. I'm just lookin for a big yellow;
in six inch stilletos
Dr. Dre {Hello..} perculatin keep em waitin
While you sittin here hatin, yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin that we penetratin, you gets natin
cause I never been to Satan, for hardcore administratin
Gangbang affiliatin; MC Ren'll have you 
wildin off a zone and a whole half a gallon
{Get to dialin..} 9 1 1 emergency
{And you can tell em..} It's my son he's hurtin me
{And he's a felon..} On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin a plea, ain't no stoppin a G
I'm in the 6 you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete?  Nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible
Beg a hoe, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
while you hand picked motherfuckers givin up transcripts

Villain blows up yo' spot
Take yo' notebook yo' bitch and yo' glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass that's alarmin
cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We chin check niggaz, them thin check niggaz
run trains on golddiggers beware these fo' niggaz
Scarin motherfuckers like Steven King flicks
Makin niggaz clear the room like a dyke flea a dick
Makin 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first nigga who you rollin with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
Cause you could lose it in a tussle nigga watch me hustle
Watch niggaz kiss my ass without flexin a muscle
Bitches - all in the back they knees waitin to buckle
Same time same channel don't change the dial
Niggaz4Life, fuckin your wife, these niggaz wild {Hello..}

Did I fall off?  Got you in your room 
rippin every "Chronic" poster on your wall off
Just cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sittin back with a smirk;
listenin with your arms crossed
Questionin Dre's credibility {What?}
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits;
Y'all be killin me
As if I need to make mo' - I got a mansion 
and six cars that are paid fo' - suck my dick! {Hello..}
We came a long way from not givin a fuck
Sellin tapes out of a trunk to movin this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker I'm Dre - I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album bitch I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin the same, lil' bitch! {Hello..}

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get? {Hello..}
