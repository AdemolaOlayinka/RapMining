Mr Smith
1995)
Yeah, you know 
it be buggin' me out, you know what I'm sayin' 
that rap, how everybody like is using metaphors and all that 
it seems like everybody's some kind of metaphor freak 
some kind of metaphorical freak or somethin' man, 
you know what I'm sayin', word up 
So, You know what I'm sayin, 
you know brother's wanna make a movie and all that 
you know how I mean, so I figured you know what I'm sayin' 
I'd just make a little movie, with a chick involved. 
Check it 
If you saw the movie Wall Street I guess you know 
The way ya stack chips and regulate wild dough 
But ain't no G-funk and far from my era 
Tales from the hood your boyz will feel terror 
MC's contaminatin' tracks with feces 
You think of pussy until a flick like Species 
Hi tech ya my pen got velocity 
Jumpin' out the SSL like Virtuosity 
And never question what I'm doin' to ya girl 
She let me dive deep like her panties is Waterworld 
But all metaphors the only thing in rap 
You brothers need to stop with that 

I'm goin' from 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 

Check it, 
I'm makin' Speed like I'm Keanu Reeves 
But too many True Lies can make a honey please 
She said, I know you want this 
Ghetto Pocahontas 
I got Higher Learnin' 
And bangin' gets monotonous 
Her ass is classic 
Cheeks was Jurrasic 
Servin' a Justice 
Poetic the way I last it 
I touch ground real windy with my lyrics 
Make her talk in tongues and feel the Holy Spirit 
Hear it, pulling light strings 
Got mad cast a swing 
When I do my thing my ballz is hairy like the Lion King 
I'm in the jungle layin' down my mack 
You brothers need to chill with that 

I'm goin' from 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 

Take me away 
You think I won't fool 
Take me away 
You think I can't fool 
Take me away 
You think I won't fool 
Take me away 
You think I can't fool 

It's kinda like miniture satellites floatin' in closets 
Spyin' in pockets 
Jumpin' out of a helicopter into a football stadium filled with cotton candy 

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 

Word up, 
So your man got a good job lovin' ya so much 
Boss on his back comin' home like 'What the fuck?' 
But you be on his side through the thick and all the thin 
That's when LL come in 
Blast a ass like Apollo 13 
Sugar get the cream 
Hoppin dom in every direction 
What a scene 
He can't understand, your best friend's plan 
Running game while you chill with the Demolition Man 
Good love, have fun, tight hugs, and flowers 
I have your girl runnin' off to fake baby showers 
Better get down before ya cryin' at home 
I got her standing on the bed gettin' closer to the Drop Zone 
Some brother's won't appreciate that 
Ain't it scary when you meet a real mack 
Let's run it back 
See the flavors in my lifestyle, chill don't even lie to me 
Balls a lethal weapon, dick a menace to society 
You ain't a player hater kid you took her off restriction 
I make her tell lies and knock the pulp out of fiction 
Kid you know I'm game tight, when you hit it tonight 
I hope she screams my name right 
This word is born kid, you know why? 

I'm goin' from 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 
Hollis to Hollywood, but is he good 

Check it.
