Wu-Tang Clan
RZA Presents Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm, Vol. 1
1998)
Wu-Tang
Holocaust punishment
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

From the hills of the Pacific
I bring fury and anger
Stabbing devils in their chest with a rusty ship anchor
Blood and sand we command and conquer
Wasted land,
Then expand the regions undiscovered by modern man
Body counts increase by thousands by the hour
The sniper on reserve blastin hots from the water tower
Absorbin' energy from the sun MC's run
My brain burst like to blow chunks outta you lungs
Blood on the pavement
Crews gaze in amazement
I was doing that to niggaz who test me on the slave ship
We sell tapes and stage jail breaks for past cell mates
Murder you at hell's gate daring bitches to yell rape
And pale face gests hollow points I swallow joints
With romantic charisma that'll make your momma moist
My voice ensemble of bullets rip through your squadron
Circulate the planets move back you better dodge 'em
Or get opened up like a margin
Buddah sargeant,
Christ I should've warned you I never missed a target
The living weapon war machine by buried king
Relentless remorse is guiltless and unclean
Also the sources supreme of my team
Black Knight brigade peels caps like tangerine
Holocaustic, hypnotic, psychotic, sub-atomic,
psychopathic, hyperactive, unattractive

We bring nothing but punishment
Like nice be runnin' shit
have 'em runnin' quick
Uppercuts is what we coming with
Fuck the government
I grab the mic, that's when the thunder hit
Never love a bitch
Rhymes echo throughout the dungeon pits

Something from my culture
I stay to harmony
The way of life that best suits me
I sincerely love Allah's mathematics
Freedom and raw The Abbott
I rest within the square
Which is 4 times 90 why niggaz trues dare
The dominant intelligence
99 elements we're offspring celibate
Without knowledge life's irrelevant
I wrote the benevolent (Wu-Tang eminent)

I bring lyrics to existence
When I speak these powerful words
The priest of pandimonium the wargod has emerged
Above sea-level that's when thunder rolls
and lightning strike down
Atrocity lay that poor ass and rain it for you compund
Chaotically the Black Knights we move erotically
Lyrically perform labotamy on your biology a prodigy
A philosophy and theology my idiology's to break down
MC's microscopically
The ghetto tropically gettin' more hectic by the second
Ghetto warfare straight bullets hit off the window sectors
And hit kids cause niggaz spit wigs with no precautions
The war I raise down from their grave to haunt your concious
With bloody screams nightmares and bloody dreams
Of niggaz haunting you through dark alleyways
Through missing smoke screen
Have you tweaking like a crack fiend
On high bean like Christine
The lords rain supreme


I'm original mallot
With metaphor dominant intelligence
I give a nigga a hardcore detention with his
birthstar invention
I was mentioned I be creeping with the intention
To break free from this evil mad society
Don't lie to me
I'm dope, I scope stuff I like to telescope
To provoke from being choked
Cause my ability is soul lying
And let me open up your insides
And man hide,
Not from confusion with this high energy I'm using
Static got you lighting and moving
Through the abyss where snakes hiss
And many men get pissed for following false elements
For following false elements
