Ice Cube
Raw Footage
2008)
The Westcoast Warlord,
The Grand Wizard,
Ice Cube,
Motherfuckers head so big they call him 'jack in the box',


I'm a superhero, like Lou Ferrigno,
Make Rob Deniro look like a zero,
Shine the spotlight, this is my night,
Get your cameras ready, let it rain confetti,
I'm a champion, I do what can't be done,
In the real league nerd, not the fantasy one
Throw your hands up, you can cheer for your boy,
When I hit the stage get an ear full of noise,
When I bring the noise from here to Illinois,
Motherfuckers love when I do what it does,
A allstar, superstar entertainer,
World class, first ?ballot? hall-of-famer,
Some rappers claim that they got a heart full of anger,
How when your lyrics weren't written by a stranger,
Fool I'm the greatest, you just the latest,
I'm loved by your grandmama, and your baby


See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,
I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stacking a lot,


Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,


I was a born loser, I was a born sinner,
Now I am a winner, in a convention center,
I got to take a bow, 'cause I still wonder how,
The system didn't get me when I was a juvenile,
Just think if I had got locked up,
No 'Boyz in da Hood' thanks to America,
No 'Eazy', 'NWA', no 'Friday',
Don't let your motherfucking talent go to waste,
Don't catch a case cause these people got a place,
To throw your life away and take you right out the waste,
Throw your hands up, you got to man up,
I had to show the world, what I was made of,
What you say Blood, I was a slave 'cause,
Now I'm V.I.P., up in Vegas,
I'm up in Nike-town, so how you like me now,
See the whole industry had to bite my style,


See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
I knew we would win so I'm bagging a lot,
I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
My shit is so dope it's like cracking a pot,


Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,


Now mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,

Mama don't be mad I got to show my ass,
And thanks these motherfuckers for my past,
I got to let them know I never break like glass,
What you looking at it's top notch world class,


See my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
You can't impress me, so fuck what you got,
I said my head is so big they call me 'jack in the box',
Don't talk about money 'cause I'm stacking a lot,


Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D,
Shine that light on me, put that light on me,
'cause I was sent to the world, by G-O-D.
