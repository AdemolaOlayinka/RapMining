"Execute them" 

"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max 
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to right the hype"

Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Check this Slovak lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, tibble and cold war
Hailin from my neck down, rounds flip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dry a hitman for hire, alien flyer 
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up

Aiyyo witness the abduction, bill of destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
Acknowledge shorties bustin, but they gotta come son
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
Peace Sudan, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Floor lies dough, wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as command in chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense for every inch of the borough
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" 
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"

Murder verser, twenty bean rap fiend server
Rhymes nurse your mind, bustin like twin burners
Certified lah, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, ?damn's fly? the rest
They bettin contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off
"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype
