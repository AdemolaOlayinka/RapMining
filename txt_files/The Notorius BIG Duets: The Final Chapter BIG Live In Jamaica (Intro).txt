The Notorius B.I.G
Duets: The Final Chapter
2005)
Ladies and Gentlemen
We're gonna ask you for some fanfare...the band fanfare because...ladies and gentlemen...sting has always gone ahead of itself.
They have done it again and again and again.
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten thousand fire sides.
And if you know...and if you enjoy hip-hop...if you want one of the coldest brothaz out of North America...a brotha that gave you a song like
Juicy...
 Uh-huh...

You hear a crew in Jamaica with something that goes like this
"Who the heck is this
Paging me in the morning
At the crack of dawning"
 Yeauh! 

Please welcome...for the first time...in Sting 96...Please welcome (welcome...welcome)
The Notorious....the Notorious...B.I.G...AKA bigge!
