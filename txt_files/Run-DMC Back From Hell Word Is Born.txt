Run-D.M.C.
Back From Hell
1990)
Let's begin, to talk!!


1990, and this is what's goin on
to the break of dawn
24/7, Run-D.M.C. in effect
That's ??
All those weak-rhymin, rewindin MC's

 That means you pause
 My word is born


Yeah, speakin on truth 
from the old school on down to the youth
Since the days, that I was the age of
"three"; stop - listen to me
This is how it used to be - "go!"
Stand on another line, why?
You did a crime now the time is mine
I school you and your crew, why?
Youse is my brother
Stop - sellin and killin one another
Take some time, to see what's missin
Brothers in the ?, we on a mission
Thinkin back from the sale you made
and back home, a grave is what your brother paid
His life, because of a system
Now you think you're down, you cold dissed him
Shut up, cause I'm fed up, with this culture
And flyin high in the sky, a big vulture
Waitin and debatin, to see who's next
for "brothers and sisters" of the opposite sex
So hold on, keep it intact
and go on, flow on, positive black
B-boys be black be proud, right on
"You know we're bout to" be black
and my word is born
My word is born
My word is born
My word is born


Let's, let's..
Let's begin to talk truth -- it seems
that y'all make a big out of things that are small
We all play the same game for fame to claim
?? bright lights and write your name
They'll soup you up, til you think you're large
Got a spot on tour, but I'm still in charge
A big nigga's hittin it, don't renege
Bust a rap like a cap like a snap of twig
that extends from the hands of a branch on a tree
Like you new jack rappers, run from me
I got proof of truth, I cut and go raw
(Word em up D!)  My word is born




1990's
And ain't nuttin changed, PUNK!
