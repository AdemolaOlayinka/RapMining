Lil Wayne
Tha Block Is Hot
1999)
Ah hmmm hmmmm
Hmmmm Hmmm

When I say I don't give a fuck
I mean that yeah
?? brains is getting bust
I didn't say that yeah
If a shipment was comin in
I need a ?? wodie
I need a sixty-forty nigga
And no chargin' that wodie
You done heard about Michael Jackson
And shiggidy shit
But you ain't never heard about me
When i'm flissin a bitch 
Niggas shoulders gettin knocked
Clean off of they head 
See that red dot comin from 
Me and my girlfriend
Cause I wants mine
I needs mine
And i'm about to get mine
At these times
Look lil' daddy 
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and i rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright

It's enemy turf that i'm on
So i'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points 
And tote my black calicoe
My lil' brother Weezy

My big brother Juvi 
Four hit the blocks
Strapped up with the Uzis

What, What, La
Gun for gun
Eye for eye
Better move yo' wife and son 
'Cause i ride or die 
Cashmoney Hot Boy
Bless me when i'm gone
But until then load up the chrome cause it's on
I been bout it
Put a ??
I drop the top and then i flip I hit his cock and make 'em flip
And i be full of that trash
i be the first one to jump out the jag bust at 'em fast
Watch the bullets chop off the head 
And make 'em fall in the grass 
One move they all die 
Lil' Weezy small frie 
Guerilla when it's war time
Y'all better learn 
When this nigga shoot it'll be all hell
Well then let 'em burn
??
Seven churn and i be damn if i let 'em go
If i don't get my dough 
Then hell will be all blowin'
'Till i R.I.P CMR i be
I put it down for all my peeps
Nigga, i'm HB for real


All i know is the streets 
And how to strap up 
When it's time shoot it
Cock yo' heaters 
Tie up yo' bags 
It's time to do it
Blaze the blunt 
Shut off the lights 
And cut down the music 
Roll down the windows 
Turn the corner 
And let loose with the bbbbrrrrrr
If ya don't know now 
Then ya never will learn
You ca play with Lil' Wayne
And yo' block get burned
You must love to go swimmin
Cause tha water gets deeper
See i bust you wide open 
And take 'ya daughter with me
Here come the beat boy 
Shoot out the street lights 
Time to bring on the heat boy 
If you ain't really wit it 
Then you better get back
I open yo' chest 
And make it look just like a wet cat
This is a death trap 
i'ma a guerilla and i mean it
leave ya' head still in a beanin'
?? on the semen
Calicoe steamin'
Red dot beamin'
Dressed up suspicious
Play with lil' Weezy you'll be ?? for the vicious

Enemy Turf
Time to strap up
