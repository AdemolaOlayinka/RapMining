Lil Wayne
Lights Out
2000)
Dawg you gotta feel me on this one
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit
look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Geezy, Juve and turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg


Age is nothing but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every rip, cas hatas likely to trip
Come home to my future wife and every night she'll flip
She end up catching rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like me a spliff drink ?? without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinking I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm able to handle my situations correctly
And I know I might be young but niggas gone defiantly respect me
But in the meanwhile I'm fighting gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm living happy now
except for the fact my daughter saying I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up
and I smoke about 3 blunts and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
just so I get through the stuff but I be like


Ahhhh man, it's complicated doing everything on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when u feel like everything is going wrong man
I'm gone stand cos I am a GROWN MAN


I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm feed up thinking everything's a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress and put up wit the stuff
just trust me it's tough
But I maintain to climb through it all and I still manage to be
Lil wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
and I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awful
And I'm walking on the edge stuck without a salute and someway
I still pick it out and shuffle out the confusion
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and just dammit
Cas ya'll cats don't really know me ya'll just no bout me
But my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I no my fathers watching and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't never said they don't appreciate what we do
but just no if I wasn't a man we wouldn't make it through




Who would have known that this would someday turn out so hetic
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with it at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew apart and I have gracefully change
I'm always street so I'll forever be facing a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first busta look weed is a habit
And ever so often I'm congratulated for the succeeding at last
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leading my path
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me no otha man can Neva make me or break me
Now I'll be faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown so I'll be good on my own but I be like
