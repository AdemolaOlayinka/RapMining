When I woke up this morning and got out the bed
I had some really fresh thoughts going through my head
they were thoughts that came from a wonderful dream
it was the vision of a world working as a team

it was a dream     (get up)
just a dream       (wake up), (wake up), (get up)

There were no guns, no what
no tanks, no what, atomic bombs 
and to be frank homeboy there were no arms
just people, working hand in hand
there was a feeling of peace all across the land

it was a dream     (wake up)
just a dream       (get up), (wake up), (wake up)

Between all countries there were good releations
there finally was a meeting to united nations
and everybody had an occupation
'cause we all worked together to fight starvation

it was a dream     (wake up)
just a dream       (wake up), (get up)

Everyone was treated on an equal basis
no matter what colors, religions or races
we weren't afraight to show our faces
it was cool to chill in foreign places

it was a dream     (get up)
just a dream       (wake up), (wake up), (get up)
(wake up), (wake up), (get up), (wake up)

All cities of the world were renovated
and the people all chilled and celebrated
they were all so happy and elated
to live in the world that they created

it was a dream     (get up)
just a dream       (wake up), (wake up), (get up)

There were no street people, we live rent free
and every single person had a place to be
a job, a home and the perfect pay
and the world was free of greed and hate

it was a dream     (wake up)
just a dream       (get up), (wake up), (wake up)

Unemployment was at a record low
and the presidents were chillin at our show
listening to the things that we had to say
and trying to create a new and brighter day

it was a dream     (wake up)
just a dream       (wake up)
it was a dream     (get up)
just a dream       (wake up)
it was a dream     (wake up)
just a dream       (get up)
it was dream       (wake up)
just a dream       (wake up)
(get up), (wake up), (wake up)
(get up), (wake up), (wake up)
(get up), (wake up), (wake up)
(get up), (wake up), (wake up)
