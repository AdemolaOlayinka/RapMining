I Am The West
2010)
I Can Show You The  To The Taj Mahal To The Strips In MIA
I Can Show The Waterfalls In Spain And Progue
To The Beaches in Troyes?
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
Nothing Like LA

When They Come To LA They Got The Wrong Impression
When They Come To LA They Gotta Learn They Lesson
When They Come To Westcoast It's Such An Obsession
When They're Played Out I'm Just An Exception
When It Comes To Girl I Need Your Affection
Everytime You Walk By You Get My Inspection
All You Gotta Do Now Is Make Your Selection
And It Won't Be Hard To Win This Election

I Can Show You The Pawls And Brawls, The Taj Mahal To The Strips In M.I.A.
I Can Show You The Waterfalls In Spain And Prague
To The Beaches In Saint-Tropez
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
Nothing Like LA

I Done Been Around The World I Ain't Impress
I Can't Wait Till We Hit LAX
Yea Toyoko Is Cool And Yea I Feel The UK
But Can't Nothing Can Fuck With California IA?
Espicially LA And I'm Feeling The Bay
But Ain't Nothing Like Rolling Down PCH
Top Down West Bound It's All Good
You Don't Go Hollywood When You're From Hollywood
Let's Go To The Hood And Fuck With The Haters
Then Head To The Staples Centre And Hang With The Lakers
No. 6 Is Cool But No. 24 Is The Champ
And Even D. Wade And Chris Bosh Know That

I Can Show You The Pawls And Brawls, The Taj Mahal To The Strips In M.I.A.
I Can Show You The Waterfalls In Spain And Prague
To The Beaches In Saint-Tropez
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
Nothing Like LA

The BET awards And Even The Grammies
They Always Pick LA Over Miami
I Love Miami I Ain't Dissing Miami
But Where Would You Rather Get Robbed For Your Grammy?
Ain't Nothing Like Sunset Boulevard
Compton And Watch If You Wanna Be Hard
We Got It All What You Thought Not At All
If You Sick Of This Shit Take A Tylenol
It's Just Me And My Woman Verses all Ya'll
And We Taking A Bow It's Our Curtain Call
The Angels Are Lost They Don't Wanna Be Found
If God Is Looking For Them I Can Show Him Around

I Can Show You The  To The Taj Mahal To The Strips In MIA
I Can Show The Waterfalls In Spain And Progue
To The Beaches in Troyes?
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
I Can Show You The World Girl The World Girl
But There Ain't Nothing Else Like LA
Nothing Like LA
