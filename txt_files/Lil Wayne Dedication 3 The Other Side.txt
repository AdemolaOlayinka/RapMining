Lil Wayne
Dedication 3
2008)
Yeahhh... 
L.A.D. 
I'm all about that cheese, swiss, mozerella 
Monster, Kobe, American or cheddar 
When it come to robbery 
Nobody do it better 
Notorious L.A.D. 
Fresh Coogi sweater 
The cleanest 
Lyrics is the meanest 
Understand my english 
Nigga, I'm a Genious 
Ice like a snow cone 
Writin in my iPhone 
Went from sellin' crack 
To sellin' ringtones 
Straight out the projects 
To million dollar homes 
Inside the Carter 
Cookin' 36 zones 
36 O's and I break them all down 
In and out of every trap 
All through the A-town 
The Embassy A.M.G. 
Young Money merger 
I'm a Young Champ Like Ben Roethlisberger 
S.S. Chevy with the big block engine 
Rims and paint cost me a whole pension 

 
I don't need nothing but my niggas 
And enough weed to go around 
A ten ounce some grams and loaded pound 
Fuck what another nigga think of me 
I'm thinkin' multi-millions 
He thinkin' G's 
Nigga please 
Get your mind right 
Fuck tryna be fresh 
Get your grind right 
Cuz I'm Like 
So in another league 
I throw my pitches 
At different degrees 
And I 
Wwril my pigskins 
At different speeds 
And I hit threes 
Cuz at different times 
I release 
My shot cold 
Nigga, I'm Hot 
Don't be tight cuz you not 
Just be happy I'm lettin' you breath 
I'm the good, I'm the bad 
I'm the devil, I'm Jesus 
Its Young Money Bitch! 
The game needs us 
Gudda Gudda, What it is nigga 
Kid-Kid Chi, Get it how you live nigga 
My nigga Mack Maine just left the dealer ship 
And Weezy just ripped the drop phantom so they feelin' sick 
Diamond rings, Diamond chains 
Royal Suites, Private planes 
Palm trees, Big change 
I can't complain 
I made a promise to myself 
That I'll never be have-not 
Nigga Fuck being broke 
Shit 
Before that day come 
I'll A.K. stamp ya 
When there's beef 
I'm in the centre like Tyson Chandler 
Fuck what you heard 
In the booth I goes off 
Like the lights if you ain't payin 
Its the third 
And you already two months late with the bill 
Clown nigga you's a lame 
Bitch Nigga 
I'm Millz! 
Young Mullah 

 
If you didnt,now you know 
Its the million dollar nigga 
With the million dollar flow 
Icicle chain 
Got a million dollar glow 
Quarter mill for the gang 
If you tryna book a show 
Templates on the bentley 
Ridin' through the checks 
Got a pocket full of money 
Nigga, Hand on my tec 
I'm demandin' respect 
I'm a man to respect 
Disrespect your man 
Put my hand round his neck 
Its no other than 
Gudda Gudda man 
Still bout my money 
Nigga, Fuck another man 
I'm on the paper chase 
All about the hustle man 
I be climbin' through your window 
Like I'm fucking Broadmnan 
Look I'm 
Shady Aftermath 
Put your head in a scope 
A Bank roll with the bucks 
Is what these young niggas killin' for 
The game dirty 
On the streets tryna deal Yayo 
Fifty clips at his hat 
Leave a peeled potatoe 

 
I call my nina bay like San Diego 
Get me twisted 
I'm a turn into a tornado 
And all my riders ridin' like a winabago 
You stay 
But I'm a let that A.K. go 
Rawer than a qualo 
Shoot you like Halo 
Give ya ass a halo 
These bitches walk around actin like they J.lo 
Man, I remember when these bitches was just hey hoe 
Hey hoe, how you doing? 
Me? 
I'm doing every fuckin thang 
Smokin them dikes 
I'm on that Mary fucking Jane 
This shit so Tom and Jerry to Lil Wayne 
And you MC's are just milk and cherries to Lil Wayne 
Haha 
And bitch I'm greedy 
But if I keep eatin you rappers 
I'll get sugars diabities 
Sweetie 
I'm a different species 
I'll crush your two fingers into a million pieces 
What the fuck do I be thinkin? 
Kill, Kill, Murder 
And Benjamin Franklin 
Your girlfriend is into them gangstas 
And me being a gangsta 
I get into your girlfriend 
I stay still when the world spins 
And ain't nobody flyer than the Birdman 
You heard me 
You heard him 
Him being me 
And we are better than 
All y'all bitches, Niggas, Hoes 
Enemies, Foes 
Threes, Twos, Ones 
But these dudes won
