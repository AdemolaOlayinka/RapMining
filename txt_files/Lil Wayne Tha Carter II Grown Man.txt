Lil Wayne
Tha Carter II
2005)
What's up baby?

I ain't trying to do nothing but get me grown man on

I ain't trying to hurt you

Only if you want me to (haha)

Yea, something like that


Yea, What's happenin' baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the navy now the captain of my own team
Hop in this, machine, vanish from the scene
Goddamn it I'm so mannish
Handle it like a standard
So put yo panties and yo pants my the trash can
Romance on the floor plans (yea)
We hold hands while we rollin', just trying to keep up wit the program
Just trying to sneak up on ya, like how you doing maam
I'm a old soul, and a young man, we got to it and
We didn't stop 'til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that 


Girl... you are... so fine
I wish that I could get you over here, girl
Tonight... so I... can get my grown man on wit you 


You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man
You don't know about it, how I'm a grown man


Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'll make an exception
For some reason I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm lookin' at you so hard, I could probably catch a charge
Feelin' the way you walk when you move yo booty applaud (damn)
I gotta keep my composure
I gotta attack my mission and handle business like a soldier
Young man, young money but the money long currency the hot spitta so grown
And yo perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Might have done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occurred they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like that, um I can see it in yo eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
Cause tonight you lookin' like miss right
And I swore to be a player for life, but I'll change for you




You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now (yea)
Fly boy baby sit back relax and, cruise wit a nigga destination satisfaction
Whose is it baby she say weezy fucking baby
I say yes in-fucking-deed, she say don't you ever leave
I say, I say but I got money on my mind
Then I tell her never mind and we do it one more time 
For a large amount of time, long and won't stop 'til daytime come home (yea)




Damn, look, that.. o that right there, that's the sunset girl, get your visor, where those Chanell shades I get you, you always losing things,
and I'm always buying new things (haha), I come a long way huh remember... remember that block, look at you, you think you all grown


You ain't no woman you a baby girl, living in the ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through, is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
