Dr. Dre
The Aftermath
1996)
Ai Aiyo Butter is, uhh, Hands-On in the house
Well check it out, put some shit on for em
Let's get it on, kick it
Ha yeah, hell yeah
Yeah that shit sounds dope
Aiyo Kim, what you got to say 



Well boy you're movin me
There's somethin physical about it
The way you're makin me feel
The way you're touching me, can't explain
Oh, I just can't keep still
When you're kissing me it gives me what I need
Hold on tight and baby do it all night (Check it)
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
I wonder how boy, you make me over 


Now tell me away, cos I can't stop from how you mean
The things you do to me
Has got my body wanting you more and more
Oh baby, it's got it bad
Your love has got me open 



Yeah
No question, kick back, watch my dope eye rise
Still an everyday brother with my eyes on the prize
Take my time analysing every song that dies
Flossin the fliest rides from hits you memorise
Been doin this since days of N.W.A.
Took it to the next level when I use to DJ
Got family and fans from New York to L.A.
They keep it real cos they know that Dre come with Bombay
G's up, ain't nuttin changed, yo freeze up!
When I come thru, player haters, women one-two
The dotted Maxwell from only a minimum of set sales
Clutch your tails for honeys waitin to exhale
Keep writin til the next millenium
Tape one hit when I serve these fiends, stuff mo' potent than Bolivian
Welcome to the Aftermath
Aiyo Crystal, what you got to say? 



It's like I'm glowing about the animal attraction
That grows between us
And then my friends ask me just where the hell I've been
They think I'm crazy, they don't understand
When you're next to me, I'm lost in ecstasy
Don't let go cos I'm about to explode (Aftermath!)
This is the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on
Baby please don't make me over 





You touch me at the spot
Ooh boy, you got me high (that's right)
And when you're loving me down, I never want you to stop
Just take it easy (say what?)
Baby boy, you babe, you touch the spot
I swear you got me open
