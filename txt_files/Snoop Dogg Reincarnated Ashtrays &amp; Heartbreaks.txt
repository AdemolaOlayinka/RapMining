Tonight, there's gonna be a whole lot of smoke in the air
Blow it hard for the ones who ain't here
Seems like every day we're putting one six feet underground
So blessed - what goes up, must come down

Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone, but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

Tomorrow when you wake up and realize life ain't fair
Throw it back, and make the whole world disappear
You never miss what you had until it's gone
When it's right, something always will go wrong

Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays

Now my buzz is gone, I need to re-up on reality
Can't let them see me weak, I need to pause on it
Is there any possibility that everyone feels like me?

Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So put 'em high, let's reminisce
You're gone but you never miss
Ashtrays and heartbreaks
I lost some, let's toast to one
So raise a glass to the memories
Set 'em free and fill up all those ashtrays
Fill up all those ashtrays
