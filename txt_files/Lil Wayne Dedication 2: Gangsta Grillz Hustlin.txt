Yeah, now what it do you know it's Weezy F. the fuckin boss

and my money real long, real real real long
and this my thirteenth year, bitch I'm still goin'

I say we be burnin bodies, we dont be burnin cars
and I got a bitch wit me, call her "Miss Without Drawers"
When I'm at the bank, you could call me "Mr. Withdraws"

If you want it I'ma bring it let Diana Ross sing it

and niggaz talk shit but when I see em they lips lock
