If you don't like the news then press eject 
Baby Davis getting older can't take a rain check 
It's time to let'em know what we expect 
Stop building SUV's strung out on OPEC 
Hold up wait up you know we come correct 
You wanna change things up, well hey just get set 
It's easier to sit back than stick out your neck 
It's easier to break things than build it correct 
We've got a president we didn't elect 
The Kyoto treaty he decided to neglect 
And still the US just wants to flex 
Keep doin' that wop we gonna break our necks 

It takes a second to wreck it 
It takes time to build 
You gots to chill 

Hate filled people wanna keep us in check 
Tearin' down each other is what they expect 
If you want love well hey that's a bet 
We've got to give before we can get 
Waiting like a batter who is on deck 
When it's time to wreck shop then shop I'll wreck 
So let's calibrate and check our specs 
We need a little shift on over towards the left 
I don't really know but I suspect 
I think it's due time that we inspect 
How they get their information and their facts are checked 
Another press conference someone's talking out their neck 

It takes a second to wreck it 
It takes time to build 
You gots to chill 

So step up to the window and place your bets 
Is the US gonna keep breaking necks 
Maybe it's time that we impeach Tex 
And the military muscle that he wants to flex 
By the time Bush is done what will be left 
Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque 
Environmental destruction and the national dept 
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest 
What the real deal why you can't connect 
Why you hating people that you never met 
Didn't your mama teach you to show some respect? 
Why not open your mind for a sec? 

It takes a second to wreck it 
It takes time to build 
You gots to chill
