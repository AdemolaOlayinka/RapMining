Yeah!

I loved her fancy underwear
I sit behind her every year
Waitin' for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with
Shes popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
she would've had the world if she were mine

But see she had other plans
I could not understand
Her and her stupid friends
Varsitys biggest fans
Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sittin outside of my door
She never know how
How everything could turn around

They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend every year
She tried to keep em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to
To make him love and treat her good
She found herself alone
Asking herself where did she go wrong

She didn't realize
She chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties
Trying to apologize
Never forget the day
She laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her
I guess she had it all

She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sittin outside of my door
She never know how
How everything could turn around

Getup!

She had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying sittin outside of my door
She never know how
How everything could turn around
(WOO)
