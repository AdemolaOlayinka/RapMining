Distant Relatives
2010
These later days in Babylon
As I watch your children grow
And the years them carry on
And I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school
And tell them
What dem fi know
All of mi friend dem mi salute
Daddi gon and Lenny Screw
Another year has come and past
Man a drop like morning dew
Uncle Warrick sick and gone
When him couldn't catch a flew
Picka T you a mi don
Respect long and overdue
When nothing never did a gwan
You still have on somethin' new
Our friendship ever last
All when one minus from few
Yes we surely had a blast
We're like family Me and you
A nuh every path you cross
Lead to somebody whe true
Of the many that are called
Only chosen is a few

Of the real friends that serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain
Your real friends will serve you long
Acquaintances will fade
Your real friends wont do you wrong
Real friend don't change

Only talking with winners
A loser or two
Got my number
Still they think they real
But they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggaz Hate the smarter ones
These are the doubters
Who's our 'bout my run
I barely made it out the slums
My value high Cause I do more than
Rap about a gun
I made money for niggaz
Ya'll never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill
Cause look at statistics
Real millionaires
And I ain't talking ghetto riches
Thorough business
You mistreating niggaz
Heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G
And if you was
I don't recall
Who would roll with ya'll
Bunch a fucking know it alls
Who's dough is small
Look what's it come to
Our rapport's good no more
We was good before
Till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down
What I took was more
Because of hatred
Opportunity wasted

Your real friends will serve you long
Your car and clothes will fade
Your real friend wont do you wrong
Real friend don't change Eh

Your real friend won't run in war
Nuh care what the cost is
You real friends are in for all the wins and the losses
Fi Real!
No question at all
Them ready fi rise the tallest
Take to the enemies
All for one
And one for all this
Real friend will hear you out
No secret feelings
Real friends won't sell you out
No bargain pleading
For real!
Always looking out
A meal!
When outside a drought
Your real!
Friend won't hide you out
No

Your real friends will serve you long
When all else fails
Your real friend wont do you wrong
Real friend don't change

May laughter
From backstabbers
Turn to tears faster
I wish for you
No snake shall slither past ya
You have to
Keep your vision clear
Cause only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings
Got only real powerful niggaz here
Real men we have a code of ethics
No question
No jealousies
No feminine tendencies
We expecting
No gossip
No phony logic
No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense
If your homey locked up
No keeping tabs
On who was the last who looked out
Selfishness
That's a character flaw
No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor?
You're dealing with
Sensitive Pre-Madonna drama
Teflon love
For my dudes who solid

Your real friends will serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain, eh
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe
When all else fails
Your real friends wont do you wrong
Real friend don't change

Now plentiful
Or scantily
My cup be full
Or emptily
With arm in arms
We'll all trod on
Through destiny
A friend that's true
Is there for me
Respect is due
They care for me
Should I be down
Or even out
They're next to me
Hey

Your real friends will serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain, hey
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe
When all else fails
Real friends won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change
