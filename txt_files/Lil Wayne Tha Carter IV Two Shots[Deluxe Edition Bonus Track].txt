Lil Wayne
Tha Carter IV
2011)
2 shots of whatever
2 shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
Goons in this bitch, leave a nigga on a stretcher
It's all there, papa, you ain't even got to measure
Laughing at how my old bitches look jealous
Well what goes around comes around: propellers
Money Over Bitches - MOB, goodfellas
Cut her ears off, ain't shit she could tell us
Write your name on the bullet, that's a fuckin love letter
If I ain't a trending topic, I'm a fucking trend-setter

I'm on 2 shots of whatever
2 shots of whatever
Man it's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser

If you're scared, go to church, Mason Betha
Sometimes the paper chase could be like chasing a leopard
The pussy wetter, wetter than it's ever been
But she gone probably try to cross the line like a Mexican
I ain't on that bullshit
Shawty fine as fuck though, now she kiss me on my neck
I hope she ain't cut-throat
Cut down on the syrup cause it made me fuck slow
Shoot so many times I'mma choke off the gunsmoke
Life, death, love, hate, pleasure, pain
Pay me no mind but I don't have change
I cock back and aim at your membrane
Broad day, no mask, close range
You can get 2 shots from wherever
2 shots from whoever
It be like a puzzle tryna put you back together
I should probably do better but probably, whatever...

Your bullshit is stinking up the place
Me no tick (Jamaican)
Can't let these bitch niggas slide and touch base
I make her cum so many times, call her "nutcase"
It's Young Money baby, take your clothes off
Give me them three holes: bowling ball
2 shots of whatever
Keep them bitches coming and she can do whatever
I'm on 2 shots of whatever
2 shots of whatever
It's like tug-of-war, tryna pull myself together
I could probably do better, but probably's like never
I'm a pimp under pressure, leave my money on the dresser
2 shots of whatever
2 shots of whatever
