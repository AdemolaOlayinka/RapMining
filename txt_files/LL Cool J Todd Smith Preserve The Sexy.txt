You seem like a type 
That wanna do a couple things 
When I look in your eyes 
I can tell you ready to swing 

 
Slow down baby 
I'm waitin more than a fling 
And I'm up on the game 
That you own G-screen 

 
Damn it's like that 
Cryin logical attacks 
Your talkin really breezy 
Easy that's crap 

 You need to fall back 
 What you sayin I'm a wreck 
 Teairra ain't a trick 
I ain't with all that 

 
Now, see you talkin real ball 
Your vibes is real cold 
You better smarten up 
Slide in the rolls 

 
I'm not the next chick 
You can hit the exit 
Everything you sayin 
It's just what I expected 

 
Parts are projected 
Many more are you collected 
Life is a movie 
I'm just tryna direct 
You know like I know 
You do wanna stay connected 
Hit you to the rules of the game 
Shorty check it 

 
 Chain on my neck 
 Preserve the sexy 
 The 0's in the check 
 Preserve the sexy 
 Crib and the whips 
 Preserve the sexy 
 Cash, the chips 
 Preserve the sexy 
 The honey on my arm 
 Preserve the sexy 
 The ice and the charm 
 Preserve the sexy 
 Teairra Mari 
 Preserve the sexy 
 Your man L on this beat 
 Preserve the sexy 

 
You really should let me 
Keep you in this epy 
Straight E-bees, H-bendels, Chanell 
This is L 

 You doin a lot of frontin 
 But that ain't hard to tell 
 You tryna flip me 
 Naw B 
 That's T 

 
Aha, we'll see 
Spend a little time with me 
By the time I make a move 
You'll be sayin finally 

 Ain't no moves to be made 
 Too many games get played 
 Too many chickens get layed 
And watch their record say she's tained 
 Where you from 
 Detroit 
 What that mean 
 I'mma point 

 
Relax, we talkin 
Don't get your draws out of joint 
I wanna see you smile 
Elevate your life style 
Cop a yacht 
Hit the south the French 

 
Not a chance 

 
Keep your little advance 
This one's on me 
In the chef's a boar 
You can eat for free 

 
Slow down sweetie 
My waist is 24 
I'm far from greedy 

 
You gonna love it believe me 

 

 
Back sippin Venome S 
Spillin it all my leanin 
My baby's smooth leather 
It' softer than most women 
Everything is crist 
From my cuff to the trimmin 
Words can't describe 
All the gummers that I've been in 

 
I've been half caught in yes 
Which whips every day 
My lil jack Russell 
Knows how to hustle 
I stay with canary's on 
Platinum on every song 
Hate it or love it 
Them respect how I does it 

 
Well I'm not them 
That's how I got gems 
Cost a quarter million Dollars 
For Don ? rims 
Understand me Slim 
That's how the game begin 
If he was me, then he do the same to him 
But L's the real deal 
So tell me how you feel 
Tell me one of your secrets 
I keep my lips sealed 

 
That's for me to know 
And you to find out 

 
Long as we both now 
What we talkin bout 

 

 What you wanna do 
 Preserve the sexy
