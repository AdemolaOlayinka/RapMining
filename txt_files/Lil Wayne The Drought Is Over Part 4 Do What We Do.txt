Ghetto bitches keep me wit em like lip glow 
College bitches keep me wit em like cliffnotes 
Cold bitches keep me wit em like thick coats 
Two foreign bitches, now thats a mink show 
Pull your skirt up, and let ya hips show 
She fell in love with a stripper at the strip show 
And now.. theres

Fuck my pillows up, fuck is really up 
I like slim chicks, I love big broads 
All the bitches love me, I need a dick guard 
And if she dont give head, shes a nimrod 
Bitch I would never put your number on my sim card 
I look at M J G and 8 ball as mentors 
And shit... all they ever told me was pimp hard 
Pimp harder, I get head and tail like a quarter
