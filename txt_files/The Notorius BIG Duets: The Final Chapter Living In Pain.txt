The Notorius B.I.G
Duets: The Final Chapter
2005)
Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggaz

Theres no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happening to me

The country bud got me chocking
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smoking
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that Killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swinging from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm living in a house of pain

Is anybody listening and tell me can you see this darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe
And it's gettin blurry, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see
When you're living in the house of pain

When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust?
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame
From doing fix to bustin tricks out the fucking frame
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block
Jealous ass suckers got it ducking for my fucking glock
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive
Skinny ass player watching victim motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm living? how I'm a hustler?
Bucking busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggaz got they AK's heading for the bird
Aiming at free ass bitches let 'em rain
Giving 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain


MJB, be worried niggaz, yea, Nas...
Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should
Cause these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflon I loaded exploding some mugs
I'm like Furious in "Boyz In the Hood"
But at the drive through I'm ain't running I'm dumping
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do
I'm calling Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth
And we party hard party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Ya'll yelling my name but y'all soon die in
Trying to portray real but they be ly-in
Cause they want the real niggaz to die so they can game
But never that, this ain't never lasting this is the house of pain
