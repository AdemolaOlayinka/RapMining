I'm so glad to see how far you've came in life.
And now since you're going to become one of the bosses, it's nice to say that someone's followed in my footsteps.
You can carry on the name and the tradition.
But remember one thing. It's respect, never cross the line, and you'll always earn a lot of cash money.
