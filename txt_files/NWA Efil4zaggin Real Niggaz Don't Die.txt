I'm a muthafuking nigga wit an attitude 



I got a case of spitting in a muthafukers face
So me and my ace we got a taste
Of a muthafukers billy club he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said nigga start running
So tell me what's the next episode
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me and waste me
I thought run nigga run but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
i get hit hard real but still muthafuker said
I want another black muthafuker dead
Niggaz ain't good for shit for me
'Cause this is a race fo second class
So get your ass up against the wall Bitch
And then he tried
They jumped me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuking wit Dre, you can't afford to be an asshole
It's just another way to let you know
Niggaz send them,niggaz send them, niggaz send them
Punk can't fuk wit me
Real muthafuking G (Got that)
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why real niggaz don't die


I just want to celebrate 



Real niggaz don't die 'cause they eventually multiply
The niggaz are wit it but taking out on I
Because the times are so wrong, got to stay so strong
Niggaz got to keep going on and on
And don't let no pail face, they throw your ass in a cell race
Have you resident suck a pie in a jail space
That's what they want to do 'cause the system is fuked around
I try to let you know what the record it's underground
They don't give a fuk about a nigga
They would rather pull the trigger
And have you running from barrels smiling saying geez
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not wit that black just so I'm not gonna nail that
All I see is niggaz getting harrass
We can't do nothing about it but get a foot in they ass
Yo, but a very nigga grabbed a nine
And started shooting muthafukers, it would put them in line
And that's how it's suppose to be
When the pussy ass niggas try to fuk wit me
Yo because the shoes let the dry
To kill a nigga cause nigga a muthafuking real nigga don't die



I'm a muthafuking nigga wit an attitude



Oh let the good die young, so they make me young and bad
Putting ass kickings on the niggaz that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, bum nigga to fuk wit
So how can a nigga die when he's causing the bloodshed
By shooting muthafukas in the head
Trying to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never want to hear me
So I'm a let 'em know how a nigga's living
Checking for muthafukas cause nobody ain't giving a damn thing
To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the muthafuking trigger
Cause a nigga ain't afraid of being locked up
I'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuk
But they still want to try
To kill a nigga like me but muthafuking real niggaz don't die
