Outkast
Aquemini
1998)
Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a  poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Kwow when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of Outkast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion filled theater
Bring your umbrella cause young fella it gets no weirder


We reign, reign supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what it brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole
Chonkyfire, spliced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Now hold on my brother no, no, no, no, can't stop the stride

You are now about entering the fifth demension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my lord


To make one bob they head would be the track job
your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhyming for granted I won't comply
With that slackin, poppin and crackin 4th ward way we snappin
They won't that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happening, see if do what yo won't do today boy
Will I live tommorrow like you can't even live cause you strayed
Motivational skills lacking, when I see you nigga packin
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car do'
But you still stay with mom though playin the king like Don doe
You chocked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be locced up
Makin them thick Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scarred
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg
