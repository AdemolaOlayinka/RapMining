This when you hear

Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues

High level natural vibes what we give in
My princess say she love it when we write pandy rhythm
Natural berry also very good for the system
Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them

Sweet sap, knees berry, cantaloupe, soup sop
Pineapple, mango my taste buds tangle
An ice cold beverage in my hunny come hideout
Chillin with my beautiful empress we are stand out

High level natural vibes what we give in
My princess say she love it when we write pandy rhythm
Natural berry also very good for the system
Some touch, some sweet, you just can't resist them

Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues

She sip the beef juice, she really love the medicine
Twink it down slow feel it good vibe settling
The weaker flavours going down
She ordered up another round
Tell me that she feel alright
Walk to Jesus never spy
Feel me grab the juice
She ever held the upper tide
No drink the red bull,
Because she don't believe the hype

Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues

Pick up the empress
Then we come pick up the fruit
Juice got to my sew and they got they fat man
Blues play up they some they carrot and
Root me come then and know me sat me casa
Snoop and the geek on see rock on
Make no you'ta yellin see my juice
Set on down the luta
Set them with the sample
And they are the roota
They my singing down the roota
Don't send me string the roota
Don't wanna no soda poppin my cup
Natural juice with the rhasta pin up

Fruit juice
Number one you know me caboose
In my God then with the fruit that they chose
Fruit juice in my glass you know me cannon loose
Take away my worry my stress and my blues
