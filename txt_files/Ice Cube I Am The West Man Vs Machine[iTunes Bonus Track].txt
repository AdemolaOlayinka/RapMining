I Am The West
2010)
Yo, we in a fight for our lives
we in a fight for our lives
and the trick thing about it
i don’t know if we can win
and what’s sad? i don’t thing we WANNA win

can you help me? a nigga need a job
i’m desperate, for some corn on the cob
i’m helpless, will i have to steal and rob?
no black? dinner so i got to ask bob
bob got a job but it’s done by a robot
no lunch breaks so it could do a whole lot
more than a human being and it’s European,
ran by a Korean, American,
so there I am, surrounded by aluminum
there’s no way you can run,
there’s no way you can be,
it’s just and me, versus modern day machinery

it’s man vs machine baby
my head’s in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

I’m a fly caught in the web
a fish stuck in the internet
don’t they know i’m a deathly catch?
eat this meat, every bite so full of stress
so what can I say to you?
i’m highly relatable and biodegradable
i thought we was unfadeable
slaves to machinery, is that the way to go?
i don’t need you to fuck 24/7
i guess that computer love
i don’t need you to love
human contact ain’t what it used to was

it’s man vs machine baby
my head’s in the guillotine baby
it might take it off clean baby
automated dreams it was man vs machine baby

the whole world is automated
it need to be investigated
when people are eliminated
what we supposed to do when its time to feed all the babies?
