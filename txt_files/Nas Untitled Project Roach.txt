It is absolutely silly, and unproductive 
to have a funeral for the word "nigger"
When the actions continue..
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters 
Not a funeral for niggers
'cause niggers - DON'T DIE 


Uh, yeah..
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin, in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin from your spit, anything 'cause I'm all less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: I got eight legs, climbin on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'ma never be able to
fly like a bumblebee, try not, to be underneath
your sneaker, pitiful creature, I'm not afraid of
your pesticide or RAID 'cause, in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eatin from same knives, forks
from, ANY man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make
if you squash me, learn to live with me
How much your Ross Motel costin? Yo, we in the city
But yo, we everywhere! Check your house good, I bet we there! 
LOOK HEED!


Niggers are like roaches - they're never gonna go away
Learn from them what we should not become
'cause niggers - DON'T DIE
