Well thats how I universally greet the whole entire world
And focus on the energy that would make your skin curl
The one strategy, the one universal plan
The master blueprint, one survival for all man
I self Lord am
So divide with me and my woman co aside it's one mind
Bear witness, one respect, one culture, one way of thinking, one vision,
making the one decision, the one way of living
Common destiny amongst all
One understanding amongst me and my woman
So that we can't fall
And keep moving forward based on actual fact
Yes you'all my beautiful Mother Earth
Respect it to the max
Can't mix up or tamper with it no more
We're on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure
And whats mine is yours, specially if we move in the same direction
Just for one common cause

Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one

As one
One family
As one
One little kiss now
As one
One entire tear
As one
And let us all love, live now

How about you
Uh huh, uh huh

What, what
I gave you tea
Thats right girl
You should agree?
Oh, yes love
A family
One family baby
Is one with thee
Uh huh, uh huh, yes
So that you see?
Right

Hey you'all, you'all
I know my womans love for me
The way she cherish me
Fulfil my every appetite
With a good degree?
Or the ways to inspire or encourage me
The right amount to nourish me
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my loving went
When times is hopeless
Sometimes I had to focus on the priceless moments
When my wisdom by,? went by unnoticed
Cos you're my everything
And what is mine is yours
Moving in the same direction for one common cause

Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one

As one
One family
As one
One little kiss now
As one
One entire tear
As one
So let us all love, live now

Ask my son right, he bears witness to you
Being the foundation you can come home and watch the babies too
The one way we agree on how to follow tradition
This one family coming first
Play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
The mother struggle
That I see, thats why my love is for you
You always hold it down for me, so I'm a hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food that come through
Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole living condition
True indeed
I know you symbolise the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities
Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Moving in the same direction, just for one common cause

Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one

As one
One family
As one
One little kiss now
As one
One entire tear
As one
So let us all love, live now
As one
One family
One little kiss now
As one
One entire tear
As one
So let us all love, live now
