Speakerboxxx / The Love Below
2003)
Tell them niggaz that be holdin' the wall, fuck y'all!!
Hit the flo' start shakin' it all, yes ya'll
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, last call
Tell them mutherfuckers holding the wall, fuck ya'll!!
Hit the flo' start shaking it all, yes ya'll
What we drinking, we drinking it all
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall, Last call


Now look here
I'm gon hit da club man, I'm gon get some love
I'm the coolest nigga ain't gon spend more than a dub
I will tell dem broads and her chickenhead friend
No Fahrarri, no Jag, no Bentley, or a Benz
Might just play the wall with this mean look on my grill
Act like I'm da hater, the Haitian from Hateville
I remember her I like she don't remember me
When I was Cadillac, Coupe Deville, and Chicken Head Drillin'



I'm gon get dat fresh fire fade and then I'm gon get laid
Like some finger-waves on pay day, my lady, you gon get paid
Makin a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
The dirtier dot has informed me, The drought has ended today
Wit no delay
And a, four piece brizzle we on our way
For a brief stay in a sweet place and a petite face to play




The boy so wild don't crack no smile
Closet like the wild kingdom, fox makes the crocodile
Pop tops and what we drink, so sit back for a while
Matter a fact, light that, and I'll be right back
They want a couple more bottles I got something for em to swallow
Anybody ever told you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook line the follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
They call me Mac-Rapalicious, and when I bubble
I blow-Trouble up, in your ear
They call me Mac-Rapalicicious, and when I bubble
Its, trouble all up in your ear




Yes, I know when to excite dem hoes
Me coat, reptilian feet, bite them hoes
Got a partner on his mind sick, he say he loved it
So cope strung I strip a bitch, Why he so dumb?
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Got tinted windows on my ride I'm inconspicuous
Bump wit this gritty thang
She ain't yours you wish she was
We don't stop, it's so repeated and continuous
Mello Copone, Don Huggy Bear
Pokey the fuckin' pimpolous ain't that cute but stick em out them drawers
I'm so infamous, dead serious!!!
From da club, to da caddy, to da holiday in
From the dusk til the dawn we gon do it again
