Shooting till my motherfuckin hand fall off 
Your trackstars the gun shot ran yall off 
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off 
I can kill yall and yall boss 
Shotguns handguns louder than a band drum 
You fuckin with the drum angel let me play you the anthem 
Bang bang bang bang call it heavy metal 
I say bang bang bitch I make you feel every letter 
B.A.N.G. B.A.N.G. G.A.N.G. 
We spray then leave 
We play when we no

Planet earth is my toilet your beneath this shit 
Then I flush and whipe my ass 
Gun slinger like a pass 
I cock back and throw a bomb now hailmary 
Your tailfairy fairy-tale very frail 
And yeah we got them hammers try and hit every nail 
Let em sail up the river with that hoe shit 
Or leave em face down in the fuckin ocean
