Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 

I feel like these motherfuckers better know me next 
I realized I never loved h.o.e.s. 
Full white top cup full of codeine mix 
Still eat a couple rappers for my protein bitch 
I'm on my so mean shit! 
And you don't know me bitch 
I do it for those who did it before me bitch 
My goon is 'gon ride even with a slow leak bitch 
And if we gettin chicken you get no piece bitchhh 
Uhhh 
Stunna man said kill 'em all 
So still I know I'm a kill 'em all 
Murder them pussy holes 
I'm flyer than a butterfly doin' the tootsie roll 
Haha, I got chips like the cookie dough 
And it takes a lot of paper to book a show 
You wouldn't know cause you couldn't know 
I'm who they're looking to and who they're looking for 
And numbers don't lieeee, lieeeeeeeeeee 
Lieeeeeeeeeee 
And numbers don't lieeee 
Yeah, better hope your math is right 
Take your body for a sacrifice 
You see those flashin' lights 
Welcome to after light 
I put on for them bitches on on for them bitches 
I put on for them bitches on on 
I put onnnnnnnnnnn
