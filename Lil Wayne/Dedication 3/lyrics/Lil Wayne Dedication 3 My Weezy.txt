I am not on your planet like Dr. Spock, 
Rock... 
To my own tune, 
Lil tune 
My stomach hurtin' 
My shit is dropping real soon 
Kill whom and whoever for whatever 
That barrel longer than a word with 10 letters 
Now you spell it 
I say Young Money bitch forever, 
And we better than all these mothafuckas up in this era 
Know'm talkin bout? 
Yeah 
I tell my niggas pick the target out, 
And then I quickly pick the target off 
Like volleyball, I'm a serve em, 
And being fake is pussy so nigga, I'm a virgin 
Dr. Carter, Tell them bitches I'm a surgeon 
Cleaner than some brand new detergent 
Ya heard me? 
And I make ya bitch get on the plane with that Fergie 
Tell em get on (Birdman Jr.'s Birdy)

Goose pimples couldn't shake me up out of the Y.M.

I heard you call your self a baller when the cameras on 
If it ain't trickin' cuz you got it

Young Money, Young Mullah

Grown men in this game 
Can't compete with me mayne 
Especially 
When I pull up in that candy red 
(54's on the dash sittin' next to Lil Wayne) 
I'm a beast 
I'm a dog 
Yeah, Yeah I rap harder 
Mic in my hand

You haters on the sidelines 
And I be a starter 
Going Bad on you kids like I'm Reginae Carter 
That's my little sister if you boys didn't know 
(Wait) 
That's Weezy's daughter 
(So don't mess with her bro!) 
Cuz we'll come find you in all kinds of cars 
Signin' out 
Young Money, D-town's All Star 

 
Its Tyga 
No lion 
I'm eating 
No Diner 
This species 
Don't diet 
Every milla fish Friday 
Squad deep 
Like the white guy from Verizon 
Gator righteous 
So its only right you meet the fugitive 
John Mcgiver 
Teenager 
School cyhphers 
I was too nicer 
Than them no liscence, 
You gets no high-fivin' 
Nigga, Roll the damn dices 
Touche 
My word play touches from the colour great 
My kick game so unreal 
They say them colours must be fake 
Never been made 
MTV, I make 
Quake your very eyesight 
My fame's no mistake 
Since the deal 
Steak dinner everyday 
For the movie 
My life is like a Compton Play 
You can see it 
Nearly breathe it 
From a couple feet away 
But stay away 
Cuz I don't 
Get along 
With them tag-along 
Let me 
Get on a song 
Period gone 
I'm off the hook like cordless phones 
My identity so right 
They think its wrong 
G.E.D. Young Money 
Finish strong, so I'm a keep goin' 
My ligaments covered in green like general symbols on my face 
Like my skin was leather made 
Leatherman Louis 
You ain't never seen 
Like a nun booty 
None before me 
After 
Its only boys 
Tyga man 
I do it for the hatin' homies
