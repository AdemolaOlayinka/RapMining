Playboy Rabbit\nAnd I like big tongues like skateboard fashion\nI got more girls than the Playboy Mansion\nI bet I serve 'em up like my name Pete Sampras\nAnd a nigga drink like the late Fred Sandford\nAnd a nigga smoke like there is no cancer\nAnd I know this world is so cold and deceivin'\nBut I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'\nYeah, and until that chosen evenin'\nI'mma be screamin Apple and Eagle\nYeah, that's right, Apple and Eagle\nHollygrove 17, I won't leave you\nNope, and this is just the preview\nBut I'm already workin on the sequel\nFuck with me wrong I'll fuck with your home\nLike a letter to the wife saying your husband is gone\nLike Muslim, I'm calm\nBut like Muslim I'll bomb\nAnd beat the track up like a hundred arms\nI'm funky like underarms\nThe engineer's recording a thunderstorm\nMy hunger forms, then ring the alarms\nThe Carter 2 was nice but the third times a charm\nWeezy Fuckin'\n",
