Get it fresh off the docks\nIt don't stop\nUhuh, I won't quit\nSay blood, you talkin money?\nThen umm, count me in\nNonstop\nYoungun all around the clock\nWatch you need? Get it fresh off the docks\nIt don't stop\nUhuh, I won't quit\nSay blood, you talkin money?\nThen umm, count me in\n\nLook\nI hustle silk\nLike I sell satin\nAnd these niggas hustlin backwards\nLike Pig Latin\nDear Captain\nI'm too fast for these fucks\nMan, the only time I see 'em\nIs when I'm passin 'em up\nThat's right\nI run laps around the block\nFor the guap\nAll I need is a gunshot\nAnd a watch\nI see the finish line\nI've seen it plenty times\nThem niggas been behind\nThem niggas spittin rhymes\nFor me it's business time\nYea, love and hate\nI walk the thinnest line\nAnd I point a AK\nRight at the witness line\nI'm on the paper chase\nFuck what they say\nThe only date marked on my calendar is payday\nAnd you could never get it free like AJ\nBut I could get you more keys than Dre Day\nAll I do is call Capito Bergante\nI just gotta call Capito Bergante\n\nI never stop grindin\nEven if Simon\nSaid it\nI'm tryna clean up like an edit\nAnd if anything comes in town we let it\nIf not we get it\nAnd put your life on credit\nJetted\nUp the block\nDid the cop\nAfter the kid\nWith the rock\nIn his sock\nFuck the neighborhood watch\nAs soon as enough money is in my knot\nI'm yellin \"Who got them keys\"\nLike the game's on lock\nMy aims on, I'm locked\nLike I spot\nBut my eyeballs are gunshots, they pop\nOutta my head\nWhen you show me the bread\nAnd I bet I could get a chicken\nIf you sold me an egg\nHave ho's walk the strip\nLike they owed me a leg\nAnd it's money over bitches\nNo Al and Peg\nBundy\nAnd on Monday\nI ain't thinkin bout Tuesday\nCause anyday could be my doomsday\nI'm a hustla\n\nShit yeah\nMoney machines\nBig stacks of money in jeans\nNever ridin on teens\nThese is grown folk\nThat I'm sittin' on ho\nFuck with a President\nLike Marilyn Monroe\nEvidence won't show\nWhat I really know\nForealla\nI'm a gorilla\nAnd they're billy goats\nI'm rare with the flow\nI'm air with the flow\nThat mean I'm\nHere\nThere\nEverywhere with the flow\n",
