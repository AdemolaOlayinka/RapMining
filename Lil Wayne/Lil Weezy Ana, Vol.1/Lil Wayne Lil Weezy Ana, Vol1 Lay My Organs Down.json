I'm from the Hollygrove area\nWhere we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier\nWe know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense\nHustling on the park bench, caution\n\nThe major bison of the boulevard\nThe barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw\nYeah, I get around like a business car\nAnd you can see me everywhere but the prison yard\nI'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough\nWeezy stay high, just look up\n\nShook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man\nCan't hide that you niggas so scared, man\nAhead of my time, I'm the already-there man\n",
