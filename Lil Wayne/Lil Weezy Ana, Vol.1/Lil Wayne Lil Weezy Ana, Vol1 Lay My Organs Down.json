    "lyrics": "You already know\nGangsta music, you know how the gangsters do it\nBangers, exlcusive\nShankers and uzis\nI got Maine in the booth\nWayne in the booth\nMoney on my mind, that mean I'm thinking of loot\n\nShit, ain't it the truth\nMoney is the top prio-\n\"Money Over Murder,\" that's the title of my bio\nWe cop drops like it's part of the policy\nThis hardbody, baby, y'all softer than wallabies\nSo hush puppies, let the big dogs ride\nDon't jump on that field when it's kickoff time\n\nAnd I, fresher than the Frebreeze bottle\nComing at the shit full throttle\nAnd I power ball like lotto\nDo it with my eyes closed\nYou niggas is all soft, soft shell tacos\n\nAnd eyes go deeper than pot holes\nFor that money, bet I'm running like a snot nose\nNo Kleenex\nDark shades, V-necks\nBitch, I ain't playing no recess\nWe reps YM, baby, that's that shit\nAnd it's fuck the world like a nasty bitch\n\nFuck raps, I bust caps for snaps\nI fuck white, I fuck blacks, I fuck Japs\nNow what's hap?\nI make stacks, ASAP\nI take that from the safe and I replace that\n\nStay strapped\nI stay low, stay back\nThe judge handing out L's like Pat Sajak\nAnd I'm all about my team like an apex\nMy you niggas turn your seats into a Playtex\n\nYes, member of a fly society\nStyle, I got several varieties\nAs a child, this guy memorized \"Scarface\" in it's entirety\nThe 80s drug era inspired me\nThat's why I dress how I dress, walk how I walk\nThat's why I rep what I rep, talk how I talk\nTwo rope chains, both of them gold\nWith a gloat like I just came home\n\nFlow touching the pedal in that F-5 yellow\nJust moving through the city like blood in the vessel\nI'm a fucking professional, so intellectual\nIt's Mr. Fat Stacks, my pockets got high cholesterol\nI need vegetables, is weed vegetables?\nI'm past commas, right now I'm seeing decimals\n\nStep to you, the opposite of my environment\nOut of all the dogs in the yard, I was the quietest\nI had a little bark, I had a little bite\nWas surrounded by niggas who snap and don't think twice\nTo kidnap your enemies, dress them up as Santa Claus and drop their bodies down their mamas' chimneys\nWater to your kidneys\nMy class G like the Bendz G\n\nMy truck waving and my rims speak\nI got burners on my rear seat\nSee, I don't say too much, so if talking becomes part of the ballgame, money talk for me, yeah, my ends speak\nYeah, what you expect? I'm from the Hollygrove area\nWhere we see more redskins than Steve Spurrier\nWe know the clock ticking, so we planning hurry up offense\nHustling on the park bench, caution\n\nThe major bison of the boulevard\nThe barracuda, fighting off the fish and raw\nYeah, I get around like a business car\nAnd you can see me everywhere but the prison yard\nI'm on that sissy hard, and that kush tough\nWeezy stay high, just look up\n\nShook up like a can of Coca-Cola that fell down five flights of stairs, man\nCan't hide that you niggas so scared, man\nAhead of my time, I'm the already-there man\n",
