Bonds\nI'm to the point, I could kill a nigga with three lines\nWatch this\nWith, three, lines\nWe got that Tussin and blunts is dipped three times\nWe light them motherfuckers up and get tree high\nAnd in the game I'm manning up like Eli\nR.I.P B.I\n(Grew up a fuckin' screw-up\nGot introduced to the game, to the game\nAnd fuckin' blew up)\nBelieve that\nI say, I say believe that\nI got my nigga Tity Boi\nDuffle bag boss\nYessir\n(Weezy whats happenin')\nGucci belt, Gucci glasses\nFour door coupe and the roof no magic\nVoila\nSo don't worry 'bout my other profession\nCause it, I send shots in the other direction\nThe old me the Rollie, the new me the ruby\nJacuzzi, the movies\nThe groupies, the two pieces\nAnd all the animals that dearly departed\nKnow that my mink game is really retarted\nI pumped a few packs, caught a few charges\nMade a few stacks and drove a few carses\nI go to the mall and buy a few closets\nThe rap Fernando Vargas\nGot my hand on my strap\nAimed at my target\nDuffle bag boy in some high-top Pradas\nGet it, straight killin em'\nI push weight and move pack\nDuffle bag boys in the front\nYoung Money in the back\n(Grew up a fuckin' screw-up\nGot introduced to the game, to the game\nAnd fuckin' blew up)\n",
