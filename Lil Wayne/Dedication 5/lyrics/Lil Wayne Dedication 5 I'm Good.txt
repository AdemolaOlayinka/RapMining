Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
Everything I said I do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I do, I did

Baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I been chasing
These hearts I been breaking (Sorry)
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck them from behind
Fuck them with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a Don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams
Got a hotel, Crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO till the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

I'm good, I'm not living like I did before
I'm good, I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I do, I did
I'm good, said I'm good
Oh, I been good
I've been out there putting down that work
I'm good, said I'm good, I said I'm good
Everything I said I do, I did
I'm good, motherfucker I'm good

This is dedicated to everybody who forgot
Forgive 'em motherfuckers
Remember, don't you remember?
I been good, we good
