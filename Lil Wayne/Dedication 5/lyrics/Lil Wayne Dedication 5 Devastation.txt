Lil Wayne
Dedication 5
2013)
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga

I got the 2-2-3 cocked, I point it at yo melon
Loose lips ain’t ship so ain’t no motherfucking telling
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
Gas up the minivan, put the pumps in the trunk
Now I be sipping on something, they got me tilled to the side
All black ski mask with Chinese eyes
Now I’ve been home for years, I’mma take yo plate
I’ma eat yo steak dead in yo face
I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
One named Nina and that yapper my side chick
We sign niggas up so wisely choose ho side with
Got something on my, that pack of kick – that’s my sidekick
I’m about that paper, roll the dice and get paid
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life
I’mma nail yo girl, shit I did that twice
Gudda!

I’m a east side nigga
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown

Money don’t make itself
These niggas gon' make me kill 'em
I should probably see a shrink but I’m afraid he’ll make me little
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
I got too many hoes, that’s my dilemma
Chop yo fucking head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get 'em mike banger on the beat, I got this banger on display
I just test-drove a new Lamborghini and got a A
Got a billion bitches, I’m looking for the one that got away
And since all these niggas watching, have some fun the time of day
Fuck yall niggas I’m skating
Got yo ho at the skate pod waiting
That dick keep on coming back, motherfucker reincarnation
I don’t want that pussy this spacious
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Hi, my name is Tune, it’s nice to eat ya
I still keep that gun like a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason uh
You don't wanna hit my blunt cause I been eating pussy all day
This gun got a head trigger, I pull this bitch til it’s bald head
Ye ain’t got no bars nigga
Recharge, you going dead
Can’t kill me, I was born dead
Crowned of thorns head
Devil horns red, have my barn head
I’m a serial killer, yo lucky charm dead
And that trash bag, they find you on leg leg leg harm head
Oh what a tangle where we we bout feel like daddy long legs
I bought that Ferrari Spider from my boys at Rykers in all my lifers
My bitch say my dick is great
But I make er say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a riffle and I’m on the edge
I bop bop and I’m riding off
I’m devastation, I’m Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
