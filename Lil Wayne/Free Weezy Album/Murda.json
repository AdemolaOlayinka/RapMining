Or you want in the paper?\nNot horoscopes but in the horror scope\nPray to God you see tomorrow, nope\nThey gave my nigga 30 for a jar of dope\nBut do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap\nBlowing so much you sneezing dick\nBelieve in me I don't believe in shit\nY'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip\nIt's Young Money till I'm in the freezer stiff\nBitch\n\nFirst degree murda\nBeg dem nuh push it further\nThis a nuh beef weh make burga\nThe youths dem strapped with dem burner\nFirst degree murda\nBeg dem nuh push it further\nThis a nuh beef weh make burga\nThe youths dem strapped with dem burner\n\nIt's all about the money nigga fuck the fame\nWhere we come from shots ring nigga broad day\nLil woadie said he had the chance he do the shit again\nPop the pills for the pain but still won't feel a thing\nIt's deeper than this rapper man the back soaking gang\nCartier frames got them looking at me strange\nWhy pre mostly heard in the rally same?\nLowkey can still get a brick off my name\nNow I'mma tell you this here for my youngin and them\nThe same ones I help the corners with do numbers with\nIf there ever was a problem watch them pull up quick\nCaught an L sticking to the script you know I switched\nWe now switch\n\nFirst degree murda\nBeg dem nuh push it further\nThis a nuh beef weh make burga\nThe youths dem strapped with dem burner\nFirst degree murda\nBeg dem nuh push it further\nThis a nuh beef weh make burga\nThe youths dem strapped with dem burner\n",
