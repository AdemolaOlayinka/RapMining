    "lyrics": "(Weed and syrup, yeah)\nAll I know is paper, I don't know these hoes\nI like mouth in my lap, and pussy on my nose\nAnd I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove\nYou hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road\nGot the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine\nAnd I swear everyday I'm on my Ariana grind\nErase I got that yay, I got that ladidadida\nAnd a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan\nLord I'm a free man like I come from Amistad\nKnow I come from Hollygrove, turnin' o's to octagons\nI get money while I'm sleep, I dream that I'm in heaven\nI dreamed I saw Lil Beezy, and smoked a gar with Wessy\nAll my niggas rest in peace, and my enemies rest pleasant\nSo when my niggas creep they catch 'em when they least expect 'em\nMomma told me if you run these streets, run these streets correctly\nWell feet don't fail me now I never knew my feet to test me\nLord knows, I wear new clothes to the mall\nTwo hoes on my arm, fur boots when it's warm\nChurch shoes to play ball\nWe spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog\nUrkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me\nAll I love is paper, I don't love these hoes\nBoy that vest won't save you, neither will heroes\nLord he better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost\nHoly moly hockey mask like Halloween like OVO\nLord all I know is strippers, all they know is poles\nAll they sell is pussy, cause they been sold their soul\nBoy you go 0 to 60, I go 1 and 2 zero's\nPedal to the metal, I call it rose gold\nLord all I know is paper, big fat money rolls\nLook at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors\nI was runnin' outta patience, 'til I heard \"All aboard\"\nThey mad cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors\nLord knows I drive fast in my driveway\nI pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake\nGod damn, a pint of lean almost 5k\nI be spendin' 25k every 5 days\nI sent my girl on a spa day cause Hood just came with them chickens\nI don't want you in the house bae\nPlus we need the kitchen, Lord, trap house in abundance\nWe got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me\nHol' up, had to switch the flow up, had to pour up, roll some more up\nWatch me go up, my doors go up, when I show up, why you show up?\nPick my bro up, pick a O up, hit the store up, get a soda\nGet us 4 cups, split a 4 up, then we slow up, yeah you know us\nThen we toast cups and we post up, don't approach us, we got toasters\nThat's my slime like we ghost bust and we both bust, give no fucks\nTake no stuff and take your stuff, then ho hunt for some choca\nI know a ho who'll rock the boat, but I row her, I'm Noah Lord\nI remember when I was no one Lord\nWhen I couldn't find jack in no ones cards\nMs. Cita I remember goin' in your gun drawer\nPuttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimetres oh Lord\nI remember dyin' on her room floor\nAnd wakin' up in some police's arms\nHe died recent, so I hope heaven made more room for him\nAnd I hope he see me, cause if he didn't save that lil boy there would be no Weezy oh Lord\n",
