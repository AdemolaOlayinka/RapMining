Psycho, you got me psycho
Baby come at me I'm not backing down
I never knew the girl would have me out here trippin'
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'
I thought I was whippin' till that pussy whipped me
I fell asleep in it like Whitney
I go hard for my baby, psycho ward for my baby
Swipe that card for my baby, body guard for my baby
Bobby Brown for my baby, lock it down for my baby
I knock that pussy out then I growl for my baby
Even psycho's need love too, I save all her text messages
I smell her panties while she in the bathroom
And taste whatever she left in them
I take pictures of her when she not lookin'
Study 'em microscopically
Marry me and then bury me and then bury her on top of me
I'm psycho, you got me psycho
Baby come at me I'm not backing down
Girl I'm so crazy for you, I left my old lady for ya
Now she done went crazy, you know she be hatin' on ya
Say she gon' be waitin' for me, but she gon' be waitin'
'Cause she know I'm crazy 'bout you
You got me all psychotic, girl I'm your patient
I'm just tryna kick it with ya, but I don't even know karate
But I know crazy
Crazy bout her attitude, crazy bout her shampoo
Jealous of her shadow dude, I'm crazy
Crazy bout her vaginal and every other avenue
Jump without a parachute, I'm crazy
Shoulda said I never do, if she says pleasure boo
Then it's my pleasure boo, you ain't gotta never move
Lookin' all edible, and I'm ready when you're ready to
You already knew
Girl you already know I ain't never lettin' go
I ain't never lettin' go
Addicted to your love a motherfucker need a Betty Ford
Your gon' have to cut me off with a sword
And if you ever leave me I ain't leavin' nothin' but a note
While I'm hangin' from the second floor
And when you don't come home then its vroom vroom vroom
Nigga ridin' round checkin' doors, oh lord
Psycho, you got me psycho
Baby come at me I'm not backing down
I never knew a girl would have me out here trippin'
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'
Psycho, you got me psycho
Baby come at me I'm not backing down
I thought I was different, I thought I was pimpin'
