Lil Wayne
Free Weezy Album
2015)
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time
Cuz my niggas is runnin' salons, just to shoot up baby moms
Trap house jump out the gym, trap house jump like LeBron
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange
Call a 16 Montana, 8 a Steve Young, and 4 a Brett Favre
My plug name is Hector but back in his country they call him Hect√≤r
She strip everyday but Sunday cuz she still make time for the lord
Got a red dot on top your head, like I got your ass on record
Don't be so cruel, Tune don't be so rude
Nah, fuck that, fuck these lil niggas, fuck these lil dudes
By the gavel or the gun nigga
I be creepin' like the shadow and the sun nigga
Be more careful how you pick and choose your words boy
Cuz I'll have you playin' scrabble with your tongue nigga
I'm Mick Jagger as a young nigga
Pourin' pink panther in a punch nigga
Think faster than these dumb niggas
We serial killers, you can get your captain crunch nigga
Hey, its Lil Wayne nigga
I been this shit since Lil Zane nigga
Tell the cops I ain't no name giver
Icicles on my finger from cocaine blizzards
Hey, its Lil Wayne nigga
I'm in the buildin' bout to hang pictures
I'm a ruler its a game of interest tryna make a mil and make a meal in the same kitchen
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time
Cuz all my niggas ex cons, and we'll go right back like the spine
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange
Please back it up one more time, girl
You act shady and I'll put this dick where the sun don't shine
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl
I got that white, that blonde haired blue eyes
I'm sellin', I'm sellin', hurry up and buy
Hurry up and buy

Cocaine Mulsanne
Blow em back, do it 'fore I switch lanes
Four clips, two things
Pardon me I'm bout to switch chains
Bag full of rocks, I'mma rockstar
By my first block I'mma blockstar
I loaned everything on the road nigga
Only thing I ain't drove is a cop car
Mr. All Black is back
And you know the floor hard, nigga cook crack
You mean the floor hard like cooked crack?
Damn right cuz I used to cook crack
Aye, 46 for the 28, 14 for the 18
See them hitters in that black van
Gold chains and a chopper like the A-Team
Nowadays everybody got a plug nigga
You know hoes say Julio
Only birds that your flippin' nigga
Is the ones in the studio
Designated driver nigga
Damn right boy them units got a chauffeur
I can't sleep without it nigga
Damn right gotta chopper by the sofa
Look at me whippin', I'm confident and cocky
If this was a category I would be rocky
Say you lookin' for that comeback look no further
Shit comin' back tan, that's that coco butter
Them 10's, them 20's, them 50's, them 100's
Lost a bag on the road I was sick to my stomach
That Britney, that Iggy Azalea I'll tell ya
Intercepted the package so I'll never mail ya, I'm gone
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time
Cuz all my niggas ex cons, and we'll go right back like the spine
Please have my money on time, please have my money on time
It's 22-5 for the B, and 11-5 for the Solange
Please back it up one more time, girl
You act shady and I put this dick where the sun don't shine
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl
Girl, girl, I got that white, girl
I got that white, that blonde haired blue eyes
I'm sellin', I'm sellin', hurry up and buy
Hurry up and buy
