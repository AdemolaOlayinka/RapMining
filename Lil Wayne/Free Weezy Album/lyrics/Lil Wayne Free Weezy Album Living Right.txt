2015)
Niggas that's me in that nice ass house
Butt-naked bitch with a nice ass
Walking around saying "you got a nice ass house"
My phone keep ringing though, my bad
I think my girl got me on Spycam, now
My homies call cocaine white trash
Charge you double just to take my trash out
I can not fuck with you bitch, cause you gon' get a nigga busted
Worrying 'bout the wrong things while I'm hustling
Put the dick up in your mouth while it's running bitch don't ask no questions
Soon as I heard they said "young nigga killed it"
Cause I go too hard I eat beats, mmm scrumptious delicious
You chewing your kidneys I hope you see blood in when you pissing
And we run up in your house on Christmas, and don't ask no questions
Just shoot whoever's present, why they open their presents up
Please Lord forgive me, I just talked to my reverend
Asked him if I'm the devil he said "that's these bitches"
See I'm from New Orleans, that bitch is infested
Shoot out like the Westerns, kill you and your bestie
Pay niggas to do it correctly, two ninas they lesbians
I gotta shoot you with both or else one would get jealous
I make money not exceptions, take pills like breath mints
She just get dick and refreshments, free all my dogs in corrections
We all we got don’t need extras, we don’t expect shit
We don’t get mad over pussy, I’m probably lying in some pussy
While fools out here dying over pussy, and that’s what I don’t understand
Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right
(You see)

Standing on the top I got a
Lot of observations
Young nigga lot of options
You, you
Running through a check
Buying all the champagne, been blowing up the net
And setting all the trends, showing niggas what’s next
I was drinking coffee, smoking weed on the jet
Probably with your wifey, getting her back for pillow talk, but we ain’t talking
Getting top, I’m laying on top, swear to God I had a chopper
Now the gun biz are the friends hopping out of helicopters
I be rolling out the doctor’s wishes
Counting up the money, kicking out the bitches
Cause they all up on you but be gone when it get real
Bitches ain’t shit but a brick to your windshield
Shows in the evening, business meetings in the morning
(Hooo)
Goons on deck, don’t make a nigga sic ‘em on ya
(Go, go, go)
Niggas talking shit gon’ make a nigga get pneumonia
Wrist so cold, think it’s sick and got Ebola
Crib so big got a bitch in every corner
Joint smoke good ‘cause I showed her how to roll it
In the mornings I got meetings with my lawyer
Arguments I’ll never be a part of
Love pussy and some good conversation
And that money, we don’t ever see a shortage
Nigga run up on me, he gonna be a goner
Bruce Wayne whip, I got a new favorite bitch
I got a joint I just rolled, I got a Liu Kang kick
I gotta do it big, it’s just how I do things
(Uh)
Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right
(You see)
My homie got the pistol and he might spazz out
Light span, mothafuckin’ light span
That shit all depend on how tonight pan out
Oh, I said these hoes ain’t right man
I left my shady bitch, I got a nice tan now
Red bandana in my right pocket
So if I pull the trigger I can wipe that down
I just put my gun up in her Coach bag
I won’t hesitate to pull it right back out
Life Coach, I don’t need no life coach
To coach me through my motherfuckin’ ups and downs
Tell a bitch don’t ask no questions, my money so old
I tell my new money, respect your elders
I’m starting to get jealous of my own reflection
The young nigga sexy, a young nigga healthy
A young nigga flexing, I’m counting my blessings
Achoo, God bless me, thank you, you’re welcome
I talk to my reverend, asked him if there’s a heaven
A heaven for a G, because me and my gangstas
Done done it all but never tell, he say “we already in hell”
I said “ain’t that a bitch” ‘cause I work too hard
But still thankful as if this shit came as a gift
I just pray for my niggas that’s out there still slangin’ that shit
Keep my distance, I can’t take that risk, I hope they understand
Cause a young nigga living right
Young nigga living right
(Nigga) Yeah a young nigga living right
A young nigga living right
Don’t get me wrong, I had to get it right
But now a young nigga living right
Bitches see me and start getting right
Because they know a nigga living right
(You see)
