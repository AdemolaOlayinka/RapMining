Lil Wayne
Free Weezy Album
2015)
Hundred thousand on a small ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the back yard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates, far in front of you
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, 5 floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that costs more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in until I'm pourin' in more than M's
I'm courting in swimsuit models that don't know who I am
In foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin', my lawyers is
So what the charges is? Put it on my tap, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this
Now tell them motherfuckers sign
I'm post bail ballin', post bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'
Post bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley
I'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary
And I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary
Then give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it
One time for the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential is crunch time, looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy and never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line, tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than some times
When the cops come you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window, in the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch you in a Enzo, stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limbo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, i got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal, the bullshit cost me a mil
It brought me to tears, I came home and brought me a crib
I walked through that bitch, strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk through that bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig, but ended up drinking all of that shit
Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out then pen
My nigga I'm, I'm post bail ballin, post bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'
Post bail ballin', go tell the warden I'm, I'm post bail ballin'
Farewell warden, I'm post bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm, post bail ballin'
Inmate Carter, post bail ballin'
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley
I'ma honk the horn, riding past the penitentiary
And I'ma drive slow, riding past the elementary
Then give it to my woes, tell 'em, don't even mention it
Soon as I get home I'm going to get that brand new Bentley
