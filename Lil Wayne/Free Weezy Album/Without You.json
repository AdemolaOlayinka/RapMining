Me, I'm a mess\nI feel powerless, hands around this bottleneck\nOh you got a new one, I'm not impressed\nAnd if he trying to flex you can give him my address yeah\nI be trying to rest but lord the devil busy\nAnd when I do I dream of you and then the Devil pinch me\nDo you ever miss me?\nDo you ever wish we get it right and the rest is history?\nI wish I could go back in time and fix my lack of time\nBecause back then I had to grind but see you thought I\u2019d rather grind\nYou thought I had the time, thought I was lying half the time\nAnd now I fantasize and agonize to pass the time lord\n\nI done spend so many of my days without you\nI done lost all my love and found no way without you\nI done gave up my soul and gave up my pride\nAnd taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you\nWithout you\nUh\nHow you doing? I can tell\nYou look like yourself and I look like I'm by myself, fuck\nBut I'm getting through it, I might as well\nCause I know will time tell but it be moving like a snail yeah\nYou got a new one, I wish you well\nThen I bite my nails, I'm scared I might hear wedding bells\nI guess I blew it, it never fails you was tired of waiting to exhale\nI wish I could go back in time and fix my frame of mind\nBack when everything was fine and we would never think of dying\nAnd I was yours and you was mine and we combine and intertwine\nAnd now we in decline finish line end of time lord\n\nI done spend so many of my days without you\nI done lost all my love and found no way without you\nI done gave up my soul and gave up my pride\nAnd taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you\nWithout you\nNow you've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong\nI'm left to live life alone, I'mma need more styrofoams\nIf you find your way home you know that porch light is on\nI lay in bed wishing your side was warm\nWe wish we could go back in time and push it in reverse\nCause this shit ain't for us baby, this shit for the birds\nBut I know what I'll do, I'll move on I got to\nAnd this is to you, for you, about you, without you girl\nI done spend so many, way too many\nOf my days without you\nI'm lost on my love\nLove\n\nI done gave up my soul and gave up my pride\nAnd taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes without you\nWithout you\nHow you doing\nI can tell\nYeah\nHow you doing\nI can tell\nYou look like yourself\nI'm by myself\n",
