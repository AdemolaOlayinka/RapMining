Lil Wayne
Tha Carter III
2008)
Baby understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Misunderstood ain't gotta be explained
But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow
Please slow down hurricane
The wind blow, my dreads swang
He had hair like wool, like wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary, hail mary no tale fairy
All real very, extraordinary
Perry mason facing, the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, I would never?
Fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree
But I don't give a fuck if you see me
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood
What's understood ain't gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave ms. Cita pain
Now it's young money baby, keep the change
My mama say fuck em and we the same
So hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday
You know church fit then outfit,
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
What you bout bitch
Excuse my french emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking, if I don't have the answer
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy
But weezy is dwayne
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I was watching t.v. the other day right
Got this white guy up there talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
Targeted by who? america
You see one in every 100 americans are locked up
One in every 9 black americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail
A young mothafucka to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
But why bring a mothafucka to jail if it's not gon stand up in court
Cause this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
Why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood hunh
You know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, the real criminals
Sex offenders, rapists serial killers
Don't get scared, don't get scared
