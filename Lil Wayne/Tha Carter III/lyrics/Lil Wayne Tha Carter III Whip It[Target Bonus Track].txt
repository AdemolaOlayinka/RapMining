Long hair pretty eyes light skin fine legs,
Phat ass, skinny stomach, pretty feet, pretty woman
Walking down the street cause I put her out my jeep,

Rings so thick I can't even make a fist

And every time I do it I do my thang,

Iwhip it like a slave likea muthafuckin slave

Like I ate a plate of roots for dinner
But I ate a plate of loot for dinner

Cause I'm tired of ballin darlin
And I roll with my riders like it's harley party
And we roll with them choppers like it's a harley party
We are all dressed in red like it's a scarlet party
I was ballin in New Orleans way before the charolette hornets
I'm an x man bitch I ain't talkin marvel comics 
Put the dirty dishes in the sank
No pork but I get paid like a piggy bank
I spit like backwash, sasquash
No back talk, I act lost

You got them funny diamonds
I got them sunny diamonds

Fuck bitches get money
