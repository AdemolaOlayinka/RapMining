Lil Wayne
Tha Carter III
2008)
La, la la la, la, la la la la

(Uh!)
Sittin in a Caddy, right like  Betty
Floatin up the aisle like the bride and her daddy
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean but get dirty like Harry
Flyer than bluebirds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck me, I'm all about "Oui" like Paris
Hilton Presidential Suite already
I'm richer than Nicole and I'm a Lion like her Daddy
I'm am hotter than the Sunday after Saturday
I swear I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar De La Hoya, box you like a casket
Or Diego Coralles, nigga keep jabbin
See my style it varies, like drugs in an alley
My leather so soft my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin jokes...apparently
A parent, yeah my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me and nigga I ain't bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride

Ow, started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin 
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

My paint bubbleish, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a kiss
Hershee's,... I'm hyphee, thump it like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit I be ballin like a Piston
Boy did I mention I fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin
I'm 9 under par in the Bentley golf cart
Your Polo be cream but the Prada's Caviar (yeah!)
Weezy I'm sick from all this tourin
You told me (sip this) then call me in the morning (yeah)
And I vow I never trust another one (another woman)
In my life, and then I got horny (ah hah)

Started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin 
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

See I ain't goin no where bitch
You know a nigga been home honey
Money fuckin retarded, call it down syndrome money
My cake sick shit, been diagnosed sickle cell brain
The revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down to Comstock
These bitches call me bling king I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas flawless in D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin on a nigga as I walk through the valley, ready?
And zoom in with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you nigga's can't believe
Like purchase persons, places all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet
I hope you nigga's know just what it is
While I'm countin my paper nigga's know I'm handlin my biz

Started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin
Started out hustlin, ended up ballin 
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
