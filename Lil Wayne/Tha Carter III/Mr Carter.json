Eheh, you know\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)\nThey've been wondering why?) I know, eheh\n(Hey Mr. Carter) Hey, Hello\n(Tell me where have you been?) Shit, you know\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)\nThey've been wondering why?) Hahaha\n\nYeah\nTo you forever, from me to you\nI heard somebody say \"Judge!\" I'm need a suit\nI'm gonna need a Coupe, I won't need a roof\nFlyer then Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice\nI got the flow, I'm tryna see the roof\nDidn't wear a bulletproof, so I got shot and you can see the proof\nBlind eyes could look at me and see the truth\nWonder if Stevie do? But I'm gonna leave it to\nGod, not Beaver, neither you\n'Cause I'm gonna murder, \"Y\" kill \"O\" and even \"U\"\nMan, I got Summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter then the sun\nGot spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung\nWinter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than you all\nAnd I will never, I will never, I will never fall\nI'm being hated by the seasons\nSo fuck you all who hatin' for no reason\n\n(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!\n(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world and I'm back again!\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?\nThey've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'! Hah!\n(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!\n(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?\nThey've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'! Ha\n\nYeah\nI been in and out the bank bitch\nWhile you all asshole niggas been on the same shit\nI flush 'em, and watch 'em go down the drain quick\nTwo words you never hear \"Wayne Quit!\"\n'Cause Wayne win, and they lose\nI call 'em April babies, 'cause they're fools\nAnd when they snooze, we up!\nFeet up like a, Parap-liguck\nOr, paraplegic? I parallel park\nIn that red and yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk\nLike I'm from Colli' Park, but I'm from Holleygrove\nNow all my bloods scream \"Zoowoo and Dadda-do!\"\nI know my role, and I play it well\nAnd I weigh it well, on my libra scale\nI suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there\nLong hair, I don't even care\n\nYoung!\n(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!\n(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?\nThey've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'!\n(Hey Mr. Carter) I am him!\n(Tell me where have you been?) Around the world now I'm back again!\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Who's been askin' 'bout me?\nThey've been wondering why?) In case you wonderin'!\n\nShyea\nI'm right here, in my chair\nWith my crown and my dear\nQueen B, as I share\nMic time with my heir\nYoung Carter, go farther\nGo further, go harder\nIs that not why we came?\nAnd if not, then why bother?\nShow no mercy in Murci\u00e9laga's\nFar from being the bastard that Marcy had fathered\nNow my name's been mentioned with the Martyrs\nThe Biggie's and the Pac's, and the Marley's and the Marcus'\nGarvey, got me a Molotov cocktail\nFlow, even if you box well, can't stop the blows\nKaboom! The Roc Boy in the room\nThe Dopebwoyy just came off the spoon\nAlso, I'm so fly I'm on auto-\nPilot, where guys just, stare at my wardrobe\nI see euros, that's right, plural\nI took so much change from this rap game it's your go\nYoung!\n(Hey Mr. Carter)\n\nIt's my go, yeah\nAnd I'm gonna go so opposite of soft\nOff the Richter, heckter\nThe Macho Man Randy Savage, far from average\nAbove Satus-Quo\nFlow, so, pro\nI know, I ride slow and when I pass\nThey say \"What's up killer man?\" Stop bringing up my past\nAnd next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z\nDon't forget Weezy Baby!\n\n(Hey Mr. Carter) Amen\n(Tell me where have you been?) Yeah\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching)\nThey've been wondering why?) Haha\n(Hey Mr. Carter) Amen\n(Tell me where have you been?) Hova!\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Weezy\nThey've been wondering why?) Baby!\n(Choir \u2012 Fade to finish)\n(Hey Mr. Carter) Hahaha\n(Tell me where have you been?) I been hustlin'\n('Cause they've been asking, they've been searching) Hustlin' hard\nThey've been wondering why?) Chyeaa\n\nAnd I swear to everything, when I leave this earth\nIt's gonna be on both feet, never knees in this dirt\nAnd you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze it hurt\nAh, we'll lose two lives, yours and mine\nGimme any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve\nAt the Funeral Parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve\nGimme any amount of time, don't let Miss Carter grieve...\n",
