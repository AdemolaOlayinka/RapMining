    "lyrics": "We are at war with the universe, the sky is falling\nAnd the only thing that can save us now\nIs sensitivity and compassion\n\n\nDaa da da, da da da daa da da\nDaa da da, da da da daa da da\n\n\nBut I know one thing's for sure\nI'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down\n\n\nYeah\nSome say tragedy's hard to get over\nBut sometimes that tragedy means it's over\nSoldier, from the academy league of rollers\nI deny being down though they seem to hold us\nMy, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong\nI ain't doing nothing but moving on\nLet the truth be known\nBut they talked that freedom at us\nAnd didn't even leave a ladder, damn\n\n\nI work at the corner store\nWe all got problems, problems\nNo one's gonna fly down low\nNo one's gonna save us now\nHow you feel you're not alone\nWe're all just jealous, jealous\nWe don't reach the sky no more\nWe just can't overcome, no\n\n\nYou tie my hands what am I gonna be?\nWhat have I done so bad?\nWhat is my destiny?\nYou tie my hands what I am I suppose to see?\nWhat have I done so bad?\nWhat am I gonna be?\n\n\nI, knock on the door, hope isn't home\nFate's not around the lucks all gone\nDon't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right\nAnd I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?\nI lost everything, but I ain't the only the one\nFirst came the hurricane, then the morning sun\nExcuse me if I'm on one\nAnd don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one\nThey try tell me keep my eyes open\nMy whole city underwater, some people still floatin'\nAnd they wonder why black people still voting\n'Cause your president still choking\nTake away the football team, the basketball team\nAnd all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit\nNo governor, no help from the mayor\nJust a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer\n\n\nThese friends they come and go\nBut I got family, family\nThese kids so fast they grow\nThey learn so quickly now\nThat there's nowhere to go\nThat there's no future, future\nDon't make this here so low\nAnd we can't overcome, no\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you come from under that water then there's fresh air\nJust breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare\nYes I know the process is so much stress\nBut it's the progress that feels the best\n'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next\nSo try they can't steal your pride it's inside\nThen find it and keep on grinding\n'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining\nI know...\n\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nSee right now we just riding on love\nA shot in the dark\nWe ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart\nWe need love\nThat's all y'all, that's all\n\n\n\nYeah, Born right here in the USA\nBut, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee\nSo accept my emotion\nDo not take it as an offensive gesture\nIt's just the epitome of my soul\nAnd I must be me\nWe got spirit y'all, we got spirit\nWe got soul y'all, we got soul\nThey don't want us to see, but we already know\n",
