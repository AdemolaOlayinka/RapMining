Cita pain\nNow it's young money baby, keep the change\nMy mama say fuck em and we the same\nSo hello mothafucka you got some sheets to change\nAnd ain't it funny how people change like easter sunday\nYou know church fit then outfit,\nBright pink and green chest look house lit\nBright pinky rings but that ain't about this\nWhat you bout bitch\nExcuse my french emotion in my passion\nBut I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion\nWhat are you asking, if I don't have the answer\nIt's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula\nBut I know you don't understand, cause you thought lil wayne is weezy\nBut weezy is dwayne\nI'm just a soul whose intentions are good\nO lord please don't let me be misunderstood\nI was watching t.v. the other day right\nGot this white guy up there talking about black guys\nTalking about how young black guys are targeted\nTargeted by who? america\nYou see one in every 100 americans are locked up\nOne in every 9 black americans are locked up\nAnd see what the white guy was trying to stress was that\nThe money we spend on sending a mothafucka to jail\nA young mothafucka to jail\nWould be less to send his or her young ass to college\nSee, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that\nOur jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that\nMeaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine\nPolice are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit\nOnly logic by riding around in the hood all day\nAnd not in the suburbs\nBecause crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood\nAnd you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going\nBut why bring a mothafucka to jail if it's not gon stand up in court\nCause this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that\nI guess it's all a misunderstanding\nI sit back and think, you know us young mothafuckas you know that 1 in 9\nWe probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood\nAnd it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have\nWhy? I really don't wanna know the answer\nI guess we just misunderstood hunh\nYou know we don't have room in the jail now for the real mothafuckas, the real criminals\nSex offenders, rapists serial killers\nDon't get scared, don't get scared\n",
