Un-fucking-believeable Lil' Waynes the President
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federlin
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money till the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him, bury him
I know one day they gotta bury him
Better lock my casket tight baby, so I don't let the devil in
Nigga, it's just me and my guitar, yea bitch I'm heavy metaling
You can get the fucking Led Zepplin
Niggas is bitches, bitches, I think they full of estrogen
And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I'm the best! And no, I ain't positive, I'm definate
I know the game like I'm reffing  it
This is The Carter, The Carter 3, the New Testament
And I'm the god and this is what I bless 'em with

Bitch I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me

Junior... brrr
It's Cash Money over everything
It's in my blood I feel it running in every vein
I'm from the mud, I am a missile like a scud
What's really good? I'm bout that Ruckers like Fudd
And I stay on my floor at Cash Money like a rug
Tied to the fucking Birdman like a lug
And Dear Mister Ronald williams...
To you, I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim
Cash Money Million, heir to the throne
Going at they heads like hair in a comb
Sitting by the window I just stare at the storm
Know I'll make it through it like hair in a comb
Yo, money over bitches, my niggas trust my senses
And I will take on that shit as the lord, as my witness
And you all have witnessed, but I have not finished
So keep your mouth closed and let your eyes listen

Bitch I'm me, I'm me, I'm me, I'm me
Baby I'm me, so who you? Ur not me, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm still a mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire, bitch
Last year they had the Grammys and left me in Miami
Sleeping on a nigga like I'm wrapping in my jammies
I'm rapping when you sleep, I was rapping when you were in jammies
Mel Gibson flow, Lethal Weapon, Book 'em Danny
I'm a monster I tell you, Monster Wayne
I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal with the house's pain
Fuck wit me I will peel like the house's paint
Lets go, Niggas doubt wont see me cause I'm better and bold
The only time I was dependent is when I'm 70 years old
Thats when I cant hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
Cause I'm so sick and tired of shitting on everybody else
I'm tryna tell you, like I'm saying sumthin
I'm from the dirty like the bottom of my pants cuffs
And there Ain't nothing gonna stop me so just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit

Yea I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me
Baby I'm me, so who you? fuck you, you're not me
And I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'ma mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire
I know that ain't fair, but I don't care
I am a mother fucking Cash Money Millionaire, bitch
