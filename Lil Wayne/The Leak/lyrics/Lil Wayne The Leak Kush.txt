Got the hoe goin' till 6
Press a button, watch the motherfucker do tricks
I don't know what you are on, but I'm on some new shit
While you're bitch is on my dick, like a glue stick
I got a grill, I don't have to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if I loose it
Straight out the clip, that's how I spit like an oozey
You can't find me 'cause I'm lost in the music
I'm runnin' this and I can jump the hurdles
I feelin' like I'm racing a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandana like the Ninja Turtles
I'm like a turtle, when I sip the purple

And I smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and I ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
 so how ya like me now...

Buck 60 on the dash, I'mma do two
Captain Crunch, these niggas is Fruit Loops
That's why your girl wanna fuck me and my group too
And I'mma make her back it up like "droop shoop"
I'm the Birdman Jr., I gotta do coups
I hop up out that motherfucker, holler "suwoop"
Hollygrove 17, I'm from the zoo crew
You would think every animal in the zoo loose
(Fuck with me) I'm on that screw juice but I keep my shit together, not a screw loose
Yeeaahh, word to my Gucc (Gucci) boots, I'm higher than a new suit

Till we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Yeah, and we smoke that kush
Yeah, that kush
Yeah, and we ball like swoosh
Yeah, like swoosh
Now how ya like me now...

Buck forty on a ring that I don't really wear
But I bet it light up the night like the city fair
This shit ain't fair, I didn't have to go there
But all this ice got me feelin' like a polar bear
I'm so aware, I'm so prepared, I'm so fly I will take off into the open air
Lift off, Cristal, please, crackers with cheese
Nigga please, we on J-E-Ts like Curtis Martin and whitley green
I'm... lightin', lightin', light the thing, light the thing, no Reggie man

You know I smoke that kush...
And I ball like swoosh 
Now how ya like me now...
