I ain't lyin', I'm thugged out!\nI'm from uptown... and that ain't no Beverly Hills\nYou wan' know what that be like? Well, curiousity kills\nSend chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy\n'Specially if it's a drought, I got ta have tha money\nTake tha hit, even if it's below tha average money\nGot to make it through tha week, and feed my family uppy\nI'm just a lil' thug, what\nBelt-buckle fall down to my cuffs, what\nAnd police don't even matter, they can suck what\nTha price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what.. what\n\nNobody burn them blocks like-a we (nawww)\nNobody bust them heads like-a we (hmmmm)\nNobody could outshin we\nTha whole CMR, CMR family (What!)

Baby live\n\nBut I'm a thug-ass nigga, arms full of some taps\nGot a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back\nYou don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga\n\nWe'll put ten-a-piece on your whole crew\n\nWhat!\n",
