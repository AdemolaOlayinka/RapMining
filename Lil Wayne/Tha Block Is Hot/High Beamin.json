I stay high\nSnatch yo' wife\nRun up in her with the K-Y\nBut it's on man\nEver since I was born Wayne\nNigga get out of line\nI get dirty like John Wayne\nI'm bout stuntin', flossin'\nWhatever come wit it\nAnd I don't shoot guns\nUnless they have a drum wit it\nAt first they wasn't wit it\nThought that I was jokin\nNow I got 'em all payin attention like they owe it\n",
