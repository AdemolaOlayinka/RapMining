Lil Wayne
Tha Block Is Hot
1999)
Say, Weezy (weezy)

Can... they remember... me?
Lil' Wee... zy

Make 'em remember (Haaa!) ya, nigga
Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!
Let 'em know how you've been for a while

All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Had ta struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with me fooli'
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my brain
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs
Guns up in my trench
When niggas playin', they get drenched
My pockets is full of lead
So, nigga, stay off tha ben
I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb
So I'on't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb
And wet dem niggas' shirt
Nigga, get 'em full of birds
Tell them niggas, Geezy!

Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga

Look, look
That time I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets
Well, shiiit! I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems
I lay back in tha cut
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here
Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow
I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders
{gun cocks} Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)
Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address
He said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'im there (Meet him there)
Nigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?)
Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)
Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)
Cowards start hollerin' 'cause they know I'm comin' for it


Lemme tell 'em
You remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out
Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought
Run in your house, "Lay down! Nobody move!
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up
Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me
My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me
!Okay! (!okay!)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)
'Cause, see, ya'll got it
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)
Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready ta sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!


Look, remember that?

Wuz up, (Are you rememberin', B.Geezy?)
I remember you, nigga, we go way back ta True Story, (Now) nigga, ya heard 
me

Look, you don't remember me?

I remember ya, nigga

I was.. I was (You were doggin') a bad dog... (You were a lil' dog) Highly 
Grove 17, off top, nigga (Uh-huh)
