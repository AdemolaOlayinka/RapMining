Yea and we smoke that kush
That kush and we ball like swoosh
Yea like swoosh
Yea and we smoke that kush
That kush and we ball like swoosh
Yea like swoosh now how you like me now


Got the hog on 2-6
Press a button watch the mothafuka do tricks
I dont know what you on but im on some new shit
While your bitch is on my dick like a gluestick
I got a grill i dont got to get my tooth fixed
The tooth fairy would retire if i lose it
Straight out the clip thats how i spit like an oozy
You cant find me cuz im lost in the music
Im running this and i can jump the hurdles
Im feelin like im racin a bunch of little turtles
Keep a bandanna like the ninja turtles
Im like a turtle wen i sip the purple




Buck 60 on the dash imma do two
Captain crunch these niggas is fruitloops
Thats why ur girl wanna fuk me and my group too
And imma make her back it up like shoo shoo
Im the birdman junior i gotta do coupes
I hop out that mothafuka holla soowoop
Hollygrove 17 im from the zoocrew
You wuld think every animal in the zoo loose
Fuk wit me im on that screw juice
But i keep my shit together not a screw loose
Word to my goosh boots
Im higher then a new suit cuz we smoke that kush




Buck 40 on a ring that i dont really wear
But i bet it light up the night like the city fair
This shit aint fair i didnt have to go there
But all this ice got me feelin like a polar bear
Im so aware im so prepared 
Im so fly ill take off into the open air
Lift off cristal please crackers with cheese
Nigga please we on j-e-t's
Like Curtis martin in white and green
Im lightin lightin light the thing
Light the thing no reggie man
U know i smoke that kush
