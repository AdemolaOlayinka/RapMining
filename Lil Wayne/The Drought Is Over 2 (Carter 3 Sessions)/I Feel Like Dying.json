I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\n(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)\n\nYeah, hello...\nGet lifted...\nYeah, I get lifted\nYeah, yeah, so get lifted... yup! Haha...\n\nI am sittin' on the clouds, I got smoke comin' from my seat\nI can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet\nPlayin' touch football, on marijuana street\nOr, in a marijuana field, you are so beneath my cleets\nGet high, so high, that I... feel... like... lying\nDown in a cigar, roll me up and smoke me 'cause...\n(I feel like dying)\n\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\n(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)\n\nSwimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth\nJumpin' off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine\nI'm at the top of the top, but... still I climb\nAnd if I should ever fall, the ground would then turn to wine\nPop, pop, I feel like flying, then I feel like frying, then...\n(I feel like dying)\n\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\n(I feel like, I feel like, I feel like...)\n\nI can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars\nI am a prisoner, locked up behind Xanax bars\nI have just boarded a plane, without a pilot\nAnd violets are blue, roses are red\nDaisies are yellow, the flowers are dead\nWish I can give you this feeling... I feel like buying\nAnd if my dealer don't have no more, then...\n(I feel like dying)\n\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\nOnly once the drugs are done, that I feel like dying... I feel like dying\n",
