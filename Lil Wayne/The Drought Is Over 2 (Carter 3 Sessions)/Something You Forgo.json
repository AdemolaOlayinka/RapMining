    "lyrics": "2007)\nI've been lonely, I've been waiting for you\nI'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)\nThe love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)\n\n\nPain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too\nNigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe\nSorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through\nGod knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to\nbe prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me\nGive me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney\nI don't wanna advance, give me back her hands\nGive me back her touch, I don't ask for much\nbut I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up\nbut everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up\nTellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck\nCause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia\nShe was my down chick, I was her soldier\nI was her gangsta, she was my shoulder\nYou were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!\n\n\nYou've been hiding, never letting it show\nAlways trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)\nYou got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)\nbut there is something you forgot\n\n\nYou forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring\nI remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing\nI remember the love, right after the fights\nYou can't tell me you don't remember those nights\nand if I would cry, then you would cry twice\nTo me you are the brightest star under sunlight\nSee take away my title, take away my stripes\nYou give me back my girl and you give me back my life\nGive me back my girl and you give me back my life\nSee this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice\nOpen up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight\nI remember the time, I wish I could bring it back\nWhat she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)\n\n\nYou've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show\nAlways trying (I see you hidin' it mama)\nto keep it under control (but I know you know)\nYou got it down (I know you do)\nand your well on your way to the top\n(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)\n\n\nBut I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center\nYou were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver\nYou know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered\nand your boyfriend is not like me\nMa you even went and got a teardrop like me\nI remember we would sit at home all day\nYou called me \"Butta\", I called you \"Babe\"\nMy momma asked about you, my partners did too\nI know your daughter will be so amazin' like you\nand I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me\nand let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with\nNo engagement can amount to your friendship\nand I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!\n\n\nI've been lonely, I've been waiting for you\nI'm pretending, and that's all I can do\nThe love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart\n",
