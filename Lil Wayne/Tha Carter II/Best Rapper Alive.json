Fuck 'em all\n(yeah) like dat jus like dat\nI'm on dat money train and the mac'll knock 'em off track\nThe quarterback well protected from the +Warren Sapp+\nThe young heart attack I spit dat cardiac\nYou can't see me baby boy you got dat catorax\nI'm right here straight out the hood jus like an alley cat\nSince everyone's a king where the fuck your palace at\nMe I got calus on my hand I can handle dat\nIts no problem baby I so got 'em\nIts just a victory lap baby I'm jus joggin'\nAnd I ain't even out of breathe\nthe motherfuckin' best yet sorry for cursing\nWho?\n",
