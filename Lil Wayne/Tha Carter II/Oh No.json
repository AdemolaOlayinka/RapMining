Ha ha\nThat's bullet holes in your sneakers got you hopping back\nIt all stop when they hit you in ya top and back\nNo cocking back silly motherfucker you ain't heard bout this\nThe clip sink down to the dick\nThat's a automatic shotty from a drum they call tommy\nGuaranteed to get you bitches from by me\nWhen I hit every piece of ya visible body he leakin'\nMortimer is no longer leapin' he sleepin'\nWhile you pussy niggas is sleeping he thinking\nDeep in thought the boy ain't even winkin'\nBob Marley got me stinking\nStacking figures I'm standing firm life's a slinky\nPipes is filled with crack cocaine\nAnd the dope go inside of the veins from where I came\nThough I bear a name only one call live with\nCoach they won't knock me off my pivot forget it\nI'm sicker with it\nPick a city buy a condo find a fine hoe let some time go chill\nWhat you know about a bongo having her mind go\nOver a convo about dough\nNothing! Man the four wheelers look so good on the sand\nTee or tanktop pocket fan\nNo pocket knife, no handgun in sight\nJust that rat tat tat tat tat tat tat tat BOOM!\nHa ha tonight I might just boost my feature price\nCause to each its own and the lights is bright\nAnd I'm feeling like Mike at a Tyson fight\nI'm from Cita house big momma's house\nShe told me to shoot ya right after I knock ya out\nAnd he ain't getting up after them shots if you hit him in the right spot\nHold up the beat might drop\n\n\nOh No, No, Oh No, No\n",
