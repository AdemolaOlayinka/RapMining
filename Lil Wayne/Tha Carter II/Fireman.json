Weezy Baby or call me Young Baby\nMy money 360, you only 180\nHalf of the game too lazy\nStill sleepin' on me but I'm bout to wake em\nYep! I'm bout to take em to New Orleans and bake em\nYeah it's hot down here take a walk with Satan yeah\nCome on mama let The Carter make ya\nToss ya like a fruit salad strawberry-grape ya\nThey ball when they can and I'm ballin' by nature\nAddicted to the game like Jordan and Payton\nYall in a race and me I'm at the finish line\nThey running for too long it's time to gimme mine\nStraight down ya chimney in ya living room is I\nWeezy allergic to wintertime... hot\n\n\nI'm the Fireman\nFire, Fa, Fireman\nI got that fire I'm hollering\nI got that fire come and try me and\nYou can spark it up and I'ma put you out\nYou can spark it up and I'ma put you out\n",
