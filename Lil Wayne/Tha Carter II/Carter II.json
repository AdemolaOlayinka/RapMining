Boxes\nYeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit\nWe so out of it, zero tolerance\nGangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it\nI'm wealthy, still fucking wit that block shit\nWet your ass up, head to feet til your socks drip\nDon't slip, you might fall and bust your ass\nNo snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass\nI hear 'em but they talking under mass\nStop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass\nThat's Cash Money, honey pie\nWe ain't running, we don't hide screaming fuck the other side\nDon't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind\nI'll put your heart on it and walk on it\nThe chalks only for the art homie\nHow they trace ya after I erase ya?\nLook around, we at war and you still in preparation\nI'm riding for them reperations, No patience\nSlow paper is better than no paper\nFast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it\nYou gotta know that paper\nIf you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper\nGotta know that photo phobia, no Kodak moments\nFeds walls with my pictures on 'em\nNah, I ain't even in the school yearbook\nI don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look\nCareer crook, get your career took\nI'm back like a brizeer hook\nBitch cheer, camouflage gear, the hunter's here\nBetter play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer\nAround here and this here is The Carter\nServe it while it's hot out the pot to your mama\nAnd Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter\nBut get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada\nI got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em\nOn the head at the bottom\nYou ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em\nAnd I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em\nGet 'em\n",
