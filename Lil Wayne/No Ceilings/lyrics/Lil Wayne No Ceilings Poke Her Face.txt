Ah, hem.
Uhm, she sa-said she could fuck me right.
I made her fuck her friend.
She said don't call her a dike, but that's gay.
Hah.
I met her on Monday and fuck all week.
'Cause everytime she leaves she comes back to the treat.
She know I love brain, so I treat her like a geek.
She love the way I spit, so I made her pussy gleet?
Ballin with my nigga and I don't give a fuck.
So, I circled the bitch, we rounded them up.
I treat her like a needa, I'm knowin her for eater, she gonn' tell Q'wuita
And Q'wuita like the media.
Hoop-the-Hoop to the bloodz.
Her lipstick match my flag, that swagg.
Weezy F. Baby got nuts that drag
I put it in your mouth 'till you choke and gag.

I poke her face off and now she faceless.
I poke her so much I deserve a bracelet.

I poke her face off and know she faceless.
And I just made Pokerface a facelift.

Chi Town Girl.
Bag match ya heels.
Her Ass Hella Fake? but it feel real.
And it felt great when we had sex.
I tore her out the frame, right next to my ex.
For mine aspect, I love your assets.
I love your miniskirt, it's easy access.
Tight game, never mediocre, So that relationship is over.
Once I poke her.
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus,
(So What'd You Do?)
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus.
It was all us.
On the tour bus, and she did all us,
On the tour bus... like..
