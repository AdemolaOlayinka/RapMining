Got em cooking, boy\nThis crooked mind of mines got em all shook\nAnd scared to look in my eyes\nI stole that fucking clock, I took the time\nAnd I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up\nAnd butt-fucked this game up\nBetter be careful when you bring my name up\nFuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim\nBut the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it\nBut I swear, one way or another\nI'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it\nI swear to God, won't spare the rod\nI'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod\nOr I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody\nSleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie\nPermanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye\nThis world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!\nMy head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal\nI'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball\nI could run circles around you so fast\nYour fuckin' head'll spin, dogg\nI'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'\n",
