Anything whatever.\nI can't tell ya\nI can show ya better\nMe and my gun, we took an oath together\nSaid I will never die, if we both together\nYeah, this is my testification\nI'm Wayne on their hands like presipatation\nAnd in hell you, you need justification\nBut, but for me it was just a vacation\n\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\nWhen's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\n\nI lost all my money\nI lost half my mind\nCan't find my direction\nWhere's the finish line\nCould I be far away from it all\nHow far it gone\nIf I can stay for it all\nThen I shouldn't fall.\n\nBut if I fall I fall up\nAnd let the clouds hug me\nAnd if I fall down\nI bet I hit the ground runnin\nBet you search and found nothing\nLooking for the finish line\nStop short cuttin\nYou fucking up your finish time\nShit, but every twice in a while\nIt feels like I'm runnin\nAnd life is the miles\nYeah, but until the lights dimmin down\nI'll be runnin around\nRunnin\n\n(Oh, will you tell...)\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\nWhen's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\n\nCounting all my pennies but it doesn't add up\nAt the mercy but somehow it ain't enough\nReading all the red lights trying not to give up\nBut I don't know how long it's gonna last all\n\nIt's almost over now\nI say it's almost over now\nThe end is gettin closer now\nBetter do what you suppose to cause\nThe world is all so short...\n\nSomebody tell me when's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\nWhen's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end up\nRunnin\nRun it all\nWhen's it gonna end\nWhere's it gonna end\nRunnin\nRun it all\n\nYeah I'm runnin outta time\nI'm runnin out of space\nFell like I'm runnin round\nBut I'm runnin in place\nWe all in the race\nI'm just another sprinter\nIf there's no finish line\nThen who's the real winna?\n",
