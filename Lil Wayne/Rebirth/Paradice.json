Sorry I'm just thinking back.\nCa-Call me crazy, I've been called worse.\nIt's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?\nI'm probably better in my afterlife.\nI should cherish life, but this ain't paradice.\n\nOh no, this ain't paradice\nOh no, this ain't paradice\nOh no, this ain't paradice\nOh, Oh, Ohh\nThis ain't paradice\nNo, this ain't paradice\nThis ain't paradice\n",
