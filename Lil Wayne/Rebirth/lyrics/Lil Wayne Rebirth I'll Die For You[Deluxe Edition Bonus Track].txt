Ayyy, I tried to treat you like no other
To be like no other in your life
Ayyy and I'd of cried to see you with another
To see you with another to win your life

Hear me out please..
HEAR ME OUT!
Hear me out before you walk up out the door
Hear me out please
Hear me out
BEFORE YOU WALK UP OUT THAT FUCKING DOOR
I loved you like no other
I do you like no other
I swear to god I motha fucking tried
I do you like no other
I treat you like no other
Without you in my life I'd fucking die
I'd die without you
I'd die
I'd die without you
I'd die
Die without you...

I'll cry, until you see an ocean
I'm sinking to the ocean's floor
To many miles
I'd die here to see you with another
To see you with another
To be in your life

Hear me out please...
HEAR ME OUT!
Hear me out before you walk up out the door
Hear me out please
Hear me out
BEFORE YOU WALK UP OUT THAT FUCKING DOOR!
I love you like no other
I treat you like no other
I need you in my mother fucking life
I treat you like no other
And there won't another
There won't be another be Mr. Right
I'd die without you
I'd die
I'll die without you
I'll die
I'll die without you
I'll die

Oooh

Bury me a G
Bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G when she cry
And I'll be looking down from the sky
Bury me a G
Ayy bury me a G when I die
Bury me a G
And I I swear
You gon here me out
Yea here me out
Here me out before you walk up out my door
You gon here me out
DON'T YOU WALK UP OUT MY FUCKING DOOR
I love you like no other
I treat you like no other
I need you in my mother fucking life
I do you like no other
I treat you like no other
I promise, I swear I'd die without you
Die without you

Die without you
