Lil Wayne
Rebirth
2010)
The loser microphone abuser
Feet hurtin I just walked from Jerusalem
So you should get on the side with the movement
I'm the proofs and I'll die just to prove it
Whatcha wanna know? Anything whatever.
I can't tell ya
I can show ya better
Me and my gun, we took an oath together
Said I will never die, if we both together
Yeah, this is my testification
I'm Wayne on their hands like presipatation
And in hell you, you need justification
But, but for me it was just a vacation

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all
When's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all

I lost all my money
I lost half my mind
Can't find my direction
Where's the finish line
Could I be far away from it all
How far it gone
If I can stay for it all
Then I shouldn't fall.

But if I fall I fall up
And let the clouds hug me
And if I fall down
I bet I hit the ground runnin
Bet you search and found nothing
Looking for the finish line
Stop short cuttin
You fucking up your finish time
Shit, but every twice in a while
It feels like I'm runnin
And life is the miles
Yeah, but until the lights dimmin down
I'll be runnin around
Runnin 

(Oh, will you tell...)
Somebody tell me when's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all
When's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all

Counting all my pennies but it doesn't add up
At the mercy but somehow it ain't enough
Reading all the red lights trying not to give up
But I don't know how long it's gonna last all

It's almost over now
I say it's almost over now
The end is gettin closer now
Better do what you suppose to cause
The world is all so short...

Somebody tell me when's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all
When's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end up
Runnin 
Run it all
When's it gonna end
Where's it gonna end
Runnin
Run it all

Yeah I'm runnin outta time
I'm runnin out of space
Fell like I'm runnin round
But I'm runnin in place
We all in the race
I'm just another sprinter
If there's no finish line
Then who's the real winna?
