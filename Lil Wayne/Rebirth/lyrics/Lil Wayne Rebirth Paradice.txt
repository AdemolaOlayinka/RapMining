Mula Baby...

She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame.
She would do anything she could to feel the flame,
When everybody knew your mood and the games you've played.
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed:

Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Yea..
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.

He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame,
And he would do anything he could to kill the pain.
When everybody knew your mood, they speaking your name,
All over the late night local news I hear them scream:
(Chorus)
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh no, this ain't paradice.
Oh, I say the sun don't shine forever.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
And everything that glitter ain't gold.
I say love don't love forever.
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Ohhh
When everything that's new gets old.
Sometimes we try to find a road to the riches;
We need roadside assistance.
Blisters on my knees from begging for forgiveness.
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but mileage on my feet,
'Cause I been climbing to the peak and running from the bullshit.
I'm tired of hearing the same songs, who told the DJ bring it back.
Dead presidents bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat.
Staring at big poster -- I swear that he be winking back.
Cut school; sell crack. Sorry I'm just thinking back.
Ca-Call me crazy, I've been called worse.
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?
I'm probably better in my afterlife.
I should cherish life, but this ain't paradice.

Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh no, this ain't paradice
Oh, Oh, Ohh
This ain't paradice
No, this ain't paradice
This ain't paradice
