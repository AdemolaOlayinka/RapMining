Cause' once you go black, you never go back\nShe wore my hair black, with curls in the back\nThen she threw that ass back, back, back\nThen I fell to the mat and after that\nEverything went black!\n\nBaby 1, 2, 3\nTell'em get the referee\nCause he can\nGet the knockout\nIf the telephone rings\nIt's an emergency\nCause he can\nGet the knockout\nGet the knockout\n\nHey Barbie, can I call you Barbara? Haha\nHey Barbie, can I call you tomorrow and today?\nCause' once you go black, you never go back\nAnd once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack\nShe threw that ass back, back, back\nThen I fell to the mat and after that\nEverything went black!\n\n\nAwe fuck it\nGive me that damn bucket\nWh-when I throw this pussy\nYou better not start duckin\nOh yo\nHit him with the blow\nLo-look out in the crowd\nAnd everybody's yellin' \"No!\"\nGrab him by his locks\nAnd give him some good box\nThen hit him below the belt\nI wanna give him good top\nTop, top\nGive him good top\nhit him below the belt\nI wanna give him good top\n1, 2, 3\nThey yellin 1, 2, 3\nI done hit him with that motherfuckin court two piece\nTell'em, tell'em the mouth out\nTo late to cop out\nGive him more head than toothpaste like I locked out\n\n\nSo just knock me out\nSo just knock me out\nYea\nJust knock me out\nSo just knock me out\nJust knock me out\nJust knock me out\nJust knock me out\nJust knock me out\n",
