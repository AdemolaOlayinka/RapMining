    "lyrics": "Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote, it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin' to, and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you. I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about. It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems I'm dealing with mine. I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man.\n\n\nShe loves me, she loves me not.\n\n\nHow many ways can I say I'm done fishin'.\nYou wanted the role, smash the audition.\nHavin' a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen.\nStill I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women.\nAnd some say it's the life I was given.\nI say it don't matter if I work at Mc-E-D's.\nI still got a fix for what you got between ya knees.\nOn a new broad, you still one to one.\nEvery once in again I like havin' some fun.\nNo disrespect intended but what's done is done.\nWomen steppin' out for love, men do what to come.\nNot a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin' on me.\nThe last thought I get is Koobie run.\nTo them girls wishin' on a star that's will stun.\nBut I gotta tell it like it is hun, one.\n\n\nShe say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.\nBut if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.\nWe better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.\n\n\nWe was high school sweethearts, talkin' since we was teens.\nEvery morning, and every evening.\nTen years later she eatin' that mean cuisine.\nI'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine.\nIn the NFL which mean Not For Long.\nCity to city, all the groupies they hop along.\nWord get back to wifey, she like \"Stop the song,\"\nI'm takin' the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone.\nMomma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears.\nBut I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years.\nAnd in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating.\nBut I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings.\nAs long as he doing right, by you and your kids.\nHow you gon' expect that man not to be who he is.\nI ain't sayin' that it's right but we often pay the price.\nCause a womens life is love, a mans love is life.\nAnd he gon' live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record.\nBut you should know by now that all niggas is dogs.\nBetter to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard.\n\n\nShe say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.\nBut if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.\nWe better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart.\n\n\nI say I don't have nothin' if I don't have you.\nLike Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo.\nAnd my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo.\nI gets all in ya head just like shampoo.\nI just wanna fuck with you like rude polices.\nI don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces.\nHey, girl don't play with my gangsta.\nAnd have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger.\nAnd I know cheaters never get crowned.\nSo I play \"fair\" like roller coasters and clowns.\nYou gotta hold ya soldier down.\nEven when the war is lookin' it is right around the corner.\nAnd you don't want to leave me, believe me.\nCause I could turn you on like a personal TV.\nIt's young weezy, I know what ya thought.\nBut I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin' my heart.\n\n\nShe say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go.\nBut if you're thinkin' of leaving you need to let me know.\nWe better together then further apart, so darlin' don't go breakin' my heart\n",
