But i just take my chance

And i just play my hand
Protection off safe
I look straight ahead

Thats what the 380 said
U gotta play in the field to get paid
And then u gotta go lay in that bed that u made
Its cashmoney this that army bregade
And im spittin like i ate a grenade
Im dippin in that apron to fade
Hittin 4 with the butt
Put the wings up and straight show em my gutt
Hate my swagga so mean
And i kno how to operate that machine
