The Drought Is Over Part 4
2007)
Ya

UH HUH


Ridin' 'round the city with some brand new heat
Brand new car, brand new feet
Brand new seats, brand new smell, put out the roach, light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shirt brand new
Fuck you bitch, my shoes brand new
Fuck you bitch, I'm actin' brand new


I'm cold like a midnight in Aspen
I am the president and the assassin
Cameras, on big lights, action
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction
Money in the mattress, money in the attic
Money on my mind, money is my habit
Stay on the grind until the money's automatic
Bitch I love money I'm a fucking fanactic
All day strapped grip tight, graspin'
Say what? Who me? Click-Clack, blast 'em
Chrome 24's tires thin like napkins
Gotta ride big cuz i am like a captain
You know i'm a boss, chillen, relaxin
Probably in my office, doin' my taxes
You little niggas so not in my bracket,
And I don't even have time to practice




I got ice, ridiculous price
Your camera has never saw a picture this nice (Hmm)
I'm fishin and the bitches will bite
It's prolly cuz my game is fixin in tight, Right
I'm fuckin every bad bitch twice
And if she does'nt wear panties then I'll fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like spice
I know what she likes
I can make a black women scream like she white
I can make a white women scream like Mike
But before she start singin', she gotta check my Mic
Niggas just hatin'
And I dun lost sight
It's like i don't see 'em I only see the night
You talkin that shit but you boys just hype
I hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight?
Louis V tennis shoes, big brown stripe
You think you fresh, Nigga I'm ripe




Brand new coupe, drivin' crazy then the mother's
Sittin' low in the seats with the burner sittin' under
Got my tank top toppe on it
Prolly ain't summer
But I ride like that cuz I'm hotter than the others
Damn, theres no keepin up with the brother man
I can spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone
Leave me alone
Now the dog is at supper
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard
I'm so far ahead of them suckers
Im gonna have to start rappin' in numbers
I promise the flows don't stop they come rappin like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers
