AH HAA
WHO WEE
Young Weezy Baby
Awwoooo


I won't deny it
I'm a xxxxxxx rider
You don't want to xxxx with me
But I bet she gon want to xxxx with me
Cause who wouldnt want to xxxx with me
Now I can't tell you xxxx bout the next man
But he ain't got nothin on me
So baby you should bury him
And just marry me, just marry me


Okay I'm lookin for a REDBONE
And when I get her I'm goin
Tap it like a Fed Phone
And shawty talk about her man
She said tired of him
I said well baby I'm gonna have you
Tryin to hide from him
And if it's weezy
Then the women want to lie to him
And I'm gon give it to EM'
Mama said give it to EM'
So I'm gon give it to her
Just the way she want it
I said girl
I'm tryin to put my name on it
I'm tryin to own it
Welcome to my ranch and
I'm gon act a donkey
From the mornin till the night
Till the mornin
And if you back it up
Then I'm gon jump on it


I said I won't deny her
Shawty is a ryder
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin
Like my bride to be
Take one knee
Let me take one knee
And I said baby will you marry me
We'll live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me


Yeah shawty said she want a ryder
And I could be that it much
More like a provider
I can provide her
And if you lookin for me
I'm prolly inside her
You only like her
I'm tryin to wife her
See I'm a lighter
And shes my firre
See we are tighter
Than grip pliers
She gets me higher
Higher than my purp
Shawty so bright when you
Look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor
Oh yeah she cold
Yeah she cooler than an ice burg
Fuck what you might heard
You only like her
I'm tryin to wife her


I said I won't deny her
Shawty is a ryder
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin
Like my bride to be
Take one knee
Let me take one knee
And I said baby will you marry me
We'll live ever after happily
Just the way it's supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me
