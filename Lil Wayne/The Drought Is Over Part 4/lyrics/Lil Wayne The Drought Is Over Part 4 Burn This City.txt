Stop playing wit me, cannon in my hand and I'll be damn if any man disrespect in my land
Intercept a nigga pass, inaffective ass nigga
I'm the f-f-fireman but I'll wet that ass nigga
My vessel pump liquor I'm a special ass nigga
No frontin I'm in front of these extra last niggas
I'm a extra bad nigga, I'm a sideways shooter
Open up the Maserati, fuck a highway trooper
Cuz now-a-days dudes'll run & tell the troopers
So I hope the same trooper could find ya when I lose ya
These niggas talkin' out the side of they medula
Preserve a nigga put his body in the cooler
Turn 'em into ice, call me Weezy the jeweler
Run up on me boy & get smoked like buddah

Niggaz shook watch Twista Weezyana gotta show 'em heaven, call the reverend

Let me do your medula, I'll pop your oblongata

Homie you are not Baby, not the Twista & not the Carter
Don't be coming to me acting petty when I carry glocks to carve ya

You could break my hands, I write wit my mind

Try to run up on the block why bother
I'ma shoot 'em wit the pump & then I go & throw his body in a ditch & won't nobody ever find you
And won't nobody talk cuz I'm a real street mobster
Ghetto gangstas I don't eat pasta
Only fuckin wit the shrimp & the lobster
Murder the pussy whole in ya boy
When I'm dressed up like a rastah
New Orleans & Chi connect stay burnin sticky
And we gettin stuntin steady gettin money that's why I'm on 50
Shit, I only be fuckin wit niggaz that earnin wit me

Sicker than the bird flu 
I am the birdman Jr. & you niggaz just bird food
We living in a whirl pool
You gotta eat or get ate & you look like bait
Don't you stick one hand over the gate
This dog will treat you niggaz just like steak
Dinner, I'm that nigga, take a break
My fuck up is a perfect mistake, I'm great
Murder, renegade music, my flow stupid
I'm cold, I spit mucus
I'm tight like suitors, righteous, ruthless
Strap, shoot ya, we rich, sue us
Snitch, leave 'em, ditch, sewers
Pushin up daises, roses, petunias
Wakes, funeral, service, communion
I'm hotter than a motherfucking hot boys reunion
Weezy

This fire is outta control, (Cuz I'm the fireman fire f-fireman) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
This fire is outta control, (You could spark it up & I'ma put you out) I'm going to burn this city, burn this city
