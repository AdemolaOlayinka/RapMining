Lil Wayne
I Am Not A Human Being
2010)
Skinny ass pants
fresh pair of vans
if you niggas keep trippin’ nigga share an ambulance
throw up blood with my hands
my gang poppin’ niggas smoke that kush and not that reggie
for you name droppin’ niggas
all day I do it
I do it like Tony
got a sign on my dick that say "bad bitches only"
I don’t drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
man I’m on that patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go "pu"
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
yeah all my niggas nuts and I’m a loose screw
bitch I get big bucks pockets on bruce bruce
yeah I talk that shit bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast
welcome to the murder show I am the muthfucking host
they call me Weezy F Baby yes I do the fucking most
Im at their throats until they choke
the God has spoke I need a smoke man

All these bitches and niggas still hatin’
I used to be a baller but now I’m Bill Gaten’
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate her man

It go dark ass shades, I can’t see them haters
now eat these fuckin bullets, don’t forget to tip the waiter
dress like a skater, ride on you like Shawn White
I’m high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
every nights a long night, every day is a holiday
I can fuck the squares now do that mean I’m out of shape
yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
weezy fuck the world, yup I fuck it till it ovulate,
get her to the crib get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F baby and the F is for a "fornicate"
Polo Ralph Lauren bitch, yeah that’s what my pajamas say
big tall glass of some shit you can’t pronounciate
Beaucoup in the bezel of my watch with the diamond face
still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
pistol in your mouth I cannot make out what you tryna say
and if they want a war, then tell them mother fuckers bombs away

All these bitches and niggas still hatin’
I used to be a baller but now I’m Bill Gaten’
got a list full of problems, I tend to em later
yeah life is a bitch but I appreciate em man

Let it breathe to em,
yes just let it breathe to em
