Lil Wayne
I Am Not A Human Being
2010)
Shawty badder than a 3 year old
keep playing and imma eat her like a pita roll
Im just sayin with my love I could feed her soul
two day getaway and we dont need our clothes
we at the pool and she lookin like a center fold
two tattoos but she say she gettin plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, seminol
me and shawty go together like chemicals
and she get mad when I call other woman hoes
you send a rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear, than lick around her lobe
and when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
and with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold

God damn you the shit
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
with you baby
with you baby
With you and only you

Uh I say damn I must be left cause you the best I ever seen right
shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling that he aint right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Lets get together over night
Shawty Im a pro and you are lookin like the prototype
But see that I took your advice,
sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
Im cruisin on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for lovin, ma im hungry like a scavenger
I-I be on that lavender
I-I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

God damn you the shit
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
with you baby
with you baby
With you and only you

Now she dont know about me
But Imma put her on it
And she aint show up out me
But cant go without me
We probably aint supposed to be together
but I wonder if our love affair her could last forever
And shawty Im with ya
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget ya
Then I told her to her face,
If everyone was like you the World would be a better place

God damn you the shit
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

With you baby
With you baby
with you baby
with you baby
With you and only you

God damn you the shit
and I’ll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I dont really know how to handle this shit
But tonight...

With you baby
With you baby
with you baby
with you baby
With you and only you
