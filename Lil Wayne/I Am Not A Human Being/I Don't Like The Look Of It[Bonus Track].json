Make my f-ckin\u2019 day\nI blow your candles out, now n-gga cut that cake\nI gotta eat bitches, like a run-away\nY\u2019all n-ggas ain\u2019t eatin, stomach ache\nOk, all these b-tches, And n-ggas still hatin\nI used to be ballin\u2019, But now I\u2019m Bill Gate\u2019n\nF-ckin with my iPhone, bumpin Illmatic\nI\u2019m on the road to riches, there\u2019s just a lil traffic\nHair still platted, thuggin is a habbit\nKeep my guitar, Hip-Hop Lenny Kravitz\nBunch of bad b-tches and I f-ck em like rabbits\nDope d-ck Weezy, ya girlfriend an addict, Uhh\n",
