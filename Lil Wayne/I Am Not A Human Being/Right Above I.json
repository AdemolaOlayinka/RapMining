'cause we on..\n\nWho else really tryin' to fuck with Hollywood Co.?\nI'm with Marley G. bro\nFlyin' Hollygrove chicks to my Hollywood shows\nAnd I wanna tell you somethin' that you probably should know\nThis that \"Slumdog millionaire\" Bollywood flow and uh..\nMy real friends never hear it from me\nFake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me\nThat's why I pick and choose\nI don't get shit confused\nI got a small circle\nI'm not with different crews\nWe walk the same path, but got on different shoes\nLive in the same buildin', but we got different views\nI got a couple cars, I never get to use\nDon't like my women single\nI like my chicks in twos\nAnd these days all the girls is down to roll\nI hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole\nPlus I've been sippin' so this shit is movin' kinda slow\nJust tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go\n\nNow tell me how you love it\nYou know you at the top when only heaven's right above it\nWe on, it's Young Money, motherfucker\nIf you ain't runnin' with it run from it, motherfucker\nAlright, now somebody show some money in this bitch\nAnd I got my bees with me like some honey in this bitch, ya dig\nI got my gun in my boo purse\nAnd I don't bust back, because I shoot first..\n\nMeet me on the fresh train\nYes I'm in the buildin'\nYou just on the list of guest names\nAnd all my riders do not give a fuck: X-Games\nGuns turn you boys into pussies: sex change..\nAnd I smoke til' I got chest pains\nAnd you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James\nWomen are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne\nI been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane\nSkinny pants and some vans\nCall me Triple-A, get my advance in advance, Amen\nAs the world spin and dance in my hands\nLife is a beach, I'm just playin' in the sand\nUgh. Wake up and smell a pussy\nYou niggas can't see me, but never overlook me\nI'm on the paper trail, there ain't no tellin' where it took me, yeah\nAnd I ain't a killer, but don't push me\n\n\nUgh. How do he say what's never said?\nBeautiful black woman\nI bet that bitch look better red\nLimpin' off tour 'cause I made more on my second leg\nMotherfuckin' Birdman junior, eleventh grade\nBall on automatic start\nI can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw\nWildcat offense.. Check the paw prints..\nWe in the buildin', you niggas in apartments\nUgh. N-now c'mon be my blood donor\nFlow so nice you ain't even gotta put a rug on her\nDo it big and let the small fall under that\nDamn where you stumbled at?\nFrom where did they gumbo at?\nKane got the fucking beat jumpin' like a jumpin' jack\nAnd you know me\nI get on this bitch and have a heart attack\nHip-Hop I'm the heart of that\nNigga nothin' short of that\nPresident Carter, Young Money Democrat. Ugh.\n\nYeah... We on... Young moola baby!\n",
