Dem packs in a bundle;\nWe'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle.\nAnd we'll make it rain till your dances will come true;\nWe'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit.\nAlone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two;\nGals give me brain, give me brain like temples.\nAnd him got the game, game sharp like a pencil;\nAnd if you want formage we can crash like a symbol.\nAnd Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe;\ntwelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes.\nCome from the land that Jesus walked through;\nSacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle.\nThem no want to run, run with me them no want to;\nMurder them, and the family them belong to.\nNext ting them kno I run a street like a cardoor;\nYou go after me, me I dearly depart you.\nHip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?;\nI can jump on any nigga song and make a part two.\nPlaytime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons;\nhow come every joint be on point like a harpoon?\nHow come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?;\nhow come every line is so raw you gone snort too?\n\nMurder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them.\nMan murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them. ...\nand that is why i'm hot...\nIts Da Drought 3, Welcome.\nHave fun!\n",
