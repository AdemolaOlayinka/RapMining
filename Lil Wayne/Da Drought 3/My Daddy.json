Yes! Chest! Feet!,\nTag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!\nYikes! Yeeks! Great! Scott!\nStorch! Can I borrow your yacht?\nWatch me and my click go all out\nLike the ball in the stands, we balls out\n\nBoy, I don't know what y'all bout\nBut, I just spit like a dog mouth\nBig ice been looking like a hog mouth\nVROOOOOOMM, I had to bring the hog out(yeah)\nLight them trees, bring a log out\nEvery day, Christmas, I'm eggnogged out\nAnd Hip-Hop is my new bought house\nMy flow just grew legs and walked out (bye)\n",
