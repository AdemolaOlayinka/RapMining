Where my money? You need to answer quick,\nOr I'll get back on my ransom shit. (Put him in the trunk)\nSo you'll be laying ontop of speakers.\nHoles all in you like an old pair of sneakers.\nBefore I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first.\nBet you any money that I will land feet first.\nMarried to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies,\nRiding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons.\nGodzilla, King Kong...and if i have to park,\nI will open up my trunk and it wil be Jurassic Park\n",
