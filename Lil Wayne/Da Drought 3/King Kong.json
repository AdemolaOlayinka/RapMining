(put him in the trunk)\nso you'll be laying ontop of speakers.\nholes all in you like an old pair of sneakers.\nbefore i do a day, on the edge, i will leap first.\nbet you any money that i will land feet first.\nmarried to the benjamins, battle all my enemies,\nriding with big foot, harry, and the hendersons.\ngodzilla, king kong...and if i have to park,\ni will open up my trunk and it wil be jurassic park\n",
