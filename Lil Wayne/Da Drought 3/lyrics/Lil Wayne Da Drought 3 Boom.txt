2007)
Yeah
Tell 'em
Yeah
Weezy bad
Na really I'm good
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood
Better know the tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground
Now you live under my feet
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And you better put O in front of my G
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker don't run it by me
My to best friends will accompany me
And right now they are in my dungaree sleep
One name Mack one name Nenna
They hit you make you do the Macarenna
Where you tools
you gonna need like a motherfucker
And I'm so New Orleans it's like a motherfucker
It's young money and we eating get you own suppa
Make me go off to the trunk and get the bone crusher


Tech's, AK's, I leave the scene ugly
Chest head face - arm leg stomach
I never been afraid I ain't scared of nothing
Because I got my thang my thang my thang
And that bitch go boom
Boom 
You hear them guns like boom
Boom 

Yeah

They like the way I ball they call me hot sauce
They no keep that toaster you can be my pop-tart
I never had height but boy I got heart
I ain't gotta speak I just let my car talk
I got more clips than any movie you saw
I pull up on you like I need some grey poupon
Hard hat no but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool drawn
Yeah
Flow retarded when I spit I get my drool on
I don't rap I just shit like newborn
I don't write I just spit like a tooth gone
So tell them haters cut it out like a coupon
How come that japper sound like a new bomb
Little nigga gotta hold the bitch wit two arms
I got that heat the fire and the lukewarm
I'm on you heal like a shoe horn
