Ride till i die, just because, pyru, b's up, bitch I'm me

Young money is the label
Let us in the door, coming in this bitch all red to the floor
And I'm blooded soowoo and I'm blooded soowoo
I got bloods on stage bloods at my shows
Fuck with my bloods got blood on your clothes
And I'm blooded soooowooo (2)
Once again its on, yea I'm back in the booth
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking about me but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me I'm just trying to be weezy
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seeing 3D
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my DC
All red so these hoes know who we be
We B's Bloods we B's
Pop pop flow yea you all niggas sweet peas
Gettin high on a yacht call it sea weed

Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they write that
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back
I ain't CPR I ain't bringing they life back
Bad CPR bad bitch on a bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack
I'm gonna shine, I live with light hat
Airforce fly call me a night jet
Brand new coupe same color as the sky
The dash same too, lord know I'm gonna try
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gonna lie
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gonna fry
Them niggas throwing salt all over my fries
So I'm gonna just walk all over them guys
Niggas throwing darts never hit the bullseye
Young money bitch new Orleans east side

Yea, been around the world rep the same thang
Been around the world its the same gang
B's up B's up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang
I told my homie streets can't sleep on life
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night
I ain't worried bout you I'm just trying do me
Last album did 2 I'm just trying do 3
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see
Bitches just wish they could call and order me
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine
(B's up!)
