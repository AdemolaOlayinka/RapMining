Drought 3
Look
I bought it out like stunner
I hope when we kiss we make you sick to your stomach
Stunning like my daddy
And your momma eat rubbers
I bet that I can do the mouth to mouth with your women
My house is a dungeon
Yellow diamond ring looking like a little funion
Stand on my toes you can call me Paul Bunjion
Touching up my flows like a nigga do construction
The microphone wet 'cause my words like seduction
And when we on the jet you don't come up on the discussion
And if you say you balling we probably don't trust you
And I know plenty freaking hoes that probably won't fuck ya
Even if you pay 'em boy they probably won't fuck you
Only if I say that she can touch you like buster
But she might touch you
And burn you like usher
Me and my click we in red like blush
I shit this rappers out and sometimes I forget to flush you
Grand daddy purp or bubble kush crush you
Explode in a bitch mouth like a gusher
Cash money young money
Check the production
I am just a martion
Get prepared for abduction
Haha
Haha
Uuum...
I walk it out like crutches
Two girls jump me like double dutches
My nigga t-streets know a girl named dutches
And everytime he see her in the streets she be causin
I told 'em he should wave the black flag 'cause she buggin
He said the pussy good
He said you digger
So I dug 'em
I'm looking for a real bad bitch with a husband
I give 'em much dick
And a whole lot of nothing
I'm spitting like I stumbled on a gold pot of something
And when I was 6 I saw my rolemodel hustling
So I gotta hustle
These rappers talking about a whole lot of nothing
You drop me on Saturday I sold out on Sunday
Fuck is the argue about
Nigga the carter out
This is what I call the drought... 3
And we don't walk it out
We drop top porch it out
They better walk 'em out
Before we chalk 'em out
We chalk it out 
We choke 'em out
They don't want it na uh
No they don't want it na uh
You see they phoney I'm not
Oh yeah they phoney I'm not
I east side walk it out
I bring New Orleans out
I am a saints fan
Oh yeah we marching now
Like wear a safes band
I play the organs now
And if he talk
Most likely I'm what they talking about
My nigga t from the east roll out that forest now
Man I'm just trying to get my peanuts I'm like Charlie Brown
OK the Uzi make that holy sound
Take two of these and walk around
Come straight from that homeless town -- this game belong to carter now
Bitch
