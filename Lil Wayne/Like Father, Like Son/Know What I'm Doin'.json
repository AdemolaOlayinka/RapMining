Yeah I know what I'm doin'\n\n\nStarted wit' a nick then I seen a hundred bricks\nStarted on a corner now a nigga 106\nHeroin ain't quiet nah you can't quiet mine\nI got the whole dirty south in line buyin' mine\nYou know I gotta shine you just bezzle yours\nI Fifty-carat mine I'm fuckin' several whores\nWhen you hear the (brrrr) you know I got the sack\n'Cause when I hit the (brrrr) he always got the packs\nM-I-Yayo I'm gettin' cake hoe\nIf you don't love Cash Money you can stay broke\nFifty on the chain twenty for the piece\nA grand for the bitch the whip is not a lease\nYou know I'm stuntin' hard Phantom in the front yard\nPut Ross on the front just to front hard\nCash Money money comin' on freight liners\nCash Money got me buyin' these great diamonds\n\n\n\n\nWe got the swine wit' the suede on top\nThe money keep a-comin' nigga peep the droptops\nThe white keep cookin' and the beige raw rock\nAnd we flip the whole bird mama cookin' out the pots\nKeep the tool in my hand 'cause we get it 'round the clock\nUntangle few knots but we still flood the blocks\nThem niggas poppin' shit but they know we stay cocked\nAnd if they ever play wit' me I'm gettin' another tear drop\n250 on the grill spent the same on the watch\nThem hoes see us winnin' so you know they gon' flock\nI bought another island wit' them foreign head lights\nI scored a hundred birds and they flew the same night\nThem laws keep a-watchin' so we shinin' so bright\nGot the tags on the windows and them brand new bikes\nBig Money Heavyweight nigga that's my life\nNeighborhood superstars got the candy on the whips and the bike nigga\n\n\n\n\nStarted wit' some hubbers 12 years old\nMan I swear to God I was 12 years old\nMy mama didn't know and Stunna ain't know 'bout it\n'Til the day I got shot they found some money in my pocket\nYeah... I know a nigga named Big Rufus that'll break ya off\nThem niggas runnin' up the terminal we takin' off\nThey say that money turn a model bitch into a dog\nAnd I got a couple Eva Pigfords in my backyard\nNigga I mack hard bitch I'm a bad boy\nFuck a security guard I turn 'em into track stars\nYou know my name baby that's Weezy Fuckin' Baby\nAnd if that nigga hatin' on ya then fuck him baby\nI tell 'em fuck 'em girl\n18 inch windows in my crib you'll see the whole world\nBitch what you tryna do? I haven't spent a check yet off The Carter 2\nI am that fuckin' dude now who the fuck are you?\n",
