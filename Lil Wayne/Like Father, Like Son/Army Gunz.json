Because...\n\n\n\n\nGet at 'em we hit 'em up if they rattin'\nNiggaz ain't fuckin' wit' the boy them niggaz softer than satin\nI'm feelin' awfully aggy yes I walk wit' the maggy\nI tell him park in a alley and leave 'em parked in the alley\nNiggaz talkin' about me but they ain't talkin' it at me\n'Cause if they talkin' it at me then I'm just talkin' to caskets\nAll that talkin' is pussy bitch you better make ya words strong\n'Cause the shit gettin' chiseled on ya tombstone\nWhat they do I got a chopper in the UHaul\nMake a real nigga bring it back to '92 dog\nBring his ass to the river drop the fool off\nHope he can swim wit' them concrete shoes on\nI got the gun right beside me who don't?\nGot beef homie I was just gettin' hungry\nWhen you come bitch you better bring a army\nWe can do it in the streets and throw a gansgta party nigga\nWhy? Because...\n\n\n\n\nThirty shots in the clip niggaz let's trip\nLine 'em up put 'em down on the guest list\nThese niggaz 'bout to make me go Rambo\nI'ma take the shit as far as it can go\nWar is the answer if ya questionin' the general\nSnap shots at'cha baby you are just a centerfold\nAnd less Kenneth Cole niggaz seem plenty bold\nPull that bitch out alright don't make me get my fishin' pole\nThem niggaz hoes really doe\nI would swing down there wit' any O Forty-Fo' and let 'em go\nLet 'em know that I ain't never been sweet and won't be\nYes I'll be right here on the ground when you want me\nMake a nigga have to come back like wit' the smack\nThomas bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact\nAnd I ain't never killed no one jack\nBut I'm honest bitch I promise I'll kill ya and that's a fact\nWhy? Because...\n",
