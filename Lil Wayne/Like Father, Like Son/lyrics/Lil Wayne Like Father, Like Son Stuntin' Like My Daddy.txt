What I'm Doing, Getting Money, What We Doing, Getting Money
What They Doing, hating on us, But They Neva Cross
Cash Money still a company, And Bitch I'm The Boss
And I Be Stunting Like My Daddy, Stunting Like My Daddy
Stunting Like My Daddy, I Be Stunting Like My Daddy
I'm The, Young Stunner, Stunting Like My Daddy
Stunting Like My Daddy, I Be Stunting Like My Daddy


Bitch I'm Paid, Thats All I Gotta Say
Can't see you Lil Nigga, The Money In The Way
And I'm, I'm Sitting High, A Gansta Ride Blades
If You Ain't Gone Ride Fly Than You Might As Well Hate
Shit I Gotta Eat... Yeah, Even Though I Ate
It Ain't My Birthday But I Got My Name On the Cake
(Shit) Believe That, If Ya Mans Wanna Play
I'mma Fuck Around And Put That Boy Brains On The Table
Pick 'em up, fuck 'em Let 'Em Lay
Where I'm From We See A Fucking Dead Body Everyday
Thats, Uptown, throw a stack at 'Em
make a song about me, I'm Throwing Shots Back At 'Em
Ya bitch on my pipe, And She Like A crack addict
And She Saw Me Cooking Eggs And She Though I Was Back At It
I Grab The Keys, Hoe I Gotta Go
I Got My Motorcycle Jacket And My motorcycle loafs
