I gotta get back to the money\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nTo the money\n\n\nNigga I ain't got a money printer\nSo for this paper chase I'm out runnin' sprinters\nYes the last two Cash Money members\nShout out to the new Cash Money members\nBaby and Slim still point guard and center\nSo much money on my mind it's all I remember\nAnd I just bought a gun wit' a extender\nAnd that bitch hold me up like suspenders\nCut like a blender sharper than a bitch\nThey got so many pussy niggaz I can make a list\nNiggaz wonder why I stress that I am the best\n'Cause even bobble heads tell me yes.. haha\nPut it on the hood I'm Hollygrove to death\nI'm already good I'm workin' on my left\nA jungle on my wrist a circus on my neck\nDon't forget the Baby no don't forget the F\n\n\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nTo the money\n\n\nBrush the platinum grab the straps homie make it happen\nComin' through my neighborhood wit' 4's on the Caddy\nLimo tints out the pound and Uptown crackin'\nRed bandanna duckin' feds and the money stackin'\nRest in peace to Miss Gladys like e'eryday\nWe on the grind for the shine and we gon' get paid\nSpent a mill' on the wheels custom wit' the navi'\n2 of the same whips we doin' it big livin' lavish\n\n\nThis is a Scott Storch and I'm a hot torch\nAnd gettin' money is my sport\nAnd understand the rap game is my court\nSo I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport\nOr some sort of... matchin' slippers or yacht shoes\nSee I don't cruise control I control the cruise\nYes... I gets throat on a boat\nAnd I vow to never fall like soap on a rope and\n\n\nI got a lot of loot and I ain't lookin' for a lady\nAnd you can never pay me I'm from Uptown baby\nI wake up in the mornin' take a piss and wash my hands\nTake a knee and thank the Man then get back to the money\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nTo the money\n\n\nFresh wit' the hustle so we bounce back on them suckers\nBlowin' big doin' gigs got it ran in hundreds\nThey reppin' layin' here we stuntin'\nOn the grind all the time homie gettin' money\n3rd Ward soldier 13th gangsta\n17th hustler known top ranker\nMoney go getter them clowns can't figure\nPoppin' at the mouth like this cutter won't split 'em\nKnow how to survive hustlin' stayin' fly\nMy whole hood cried when my lil' brother died\nKnow I had to ride never let it slide\nIt's just the G in me and I'ma get it til I die daddy\n\n\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nYou ain't know I gotta go\nWhere ya goin'? I gotta get back to the money\nTo the money\n",
