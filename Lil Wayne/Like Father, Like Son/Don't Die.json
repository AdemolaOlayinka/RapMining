When it's empty\nAnd you still drawing Leonardo D'Vinci\n\n\nTrap me, I'm in there early, gettin money ridin dirty\nUptown puttin in down blowin out the pound\nDuffle bag full of cash when I come around\nThe lil' homie got the game so I put him down\nHold my town, world wide wearin a crown\nLike father like son, got it off the mound\nLike father like son, nigga's stand their grounds\nLike father like son, nigga fuck them clowns\n\n\n\n\nYeah nigga,\nUn-fuckin-believable\nI know y'all hear some more shit about me and my little young nigga\nYou know, they mouth like they ass\nAnything will come outta that motherfucker ya' heard me\nBig shouts to all them cities who opened your arms to us nigga\nAnd let us through that motherfucker, ya' heard me\nCause that water ran us out that motherfucker, but we did bounce back\nBelieve that 305, 404, 713, all that, Dallas, Kansas\nEverybody ya' heard me, Oklahoma, yeah, everybody, the whole world\n",
