Bitches come a dime a dozen I fuck them sisters cousins
It's a revolving dough pussy coming pussy going
And when it goes to you its coming back to me with money
I tell her keep them shoes on and keep my paper running
I put my mack down just like a G's supposed to
And if she don't come home with it then shes sleeping over
I got them creeping over we do it  with the soda
I like them Amery's you can have them amerossas
Them niggas down below us baby we up and over
Im trying to get inside that thang that sit between your shoulders
Im talking large toters im talking large motors
Im talking burning rubber that melt in Pirelli odor
Im hopping out a lotus you looking at my bitch
You wanna holla you can holla take her on a trip
But when the deed done you gotta send her back

Cause if it aint about that dough it aint about me neither
See a gangster like myself I get that paper and pussy
Then theres when I make that pussy bring the paper right to me
Bitch your looking at a real pimp that's my old hoe
And they'll telll you no remote I control hoes

And if you smile at my bitch I make her smile back

See that other chick asked that she said where the cash at
She said where the paper plastic product and where the stash at
With it she said the whip and the clip and wheres the address at
So that bitch that be hiding shit in the ass crack
Niggas don't fuckin call be baby like im related to weezy
Some of them call me aura none of them call me easy
Found out im fuckin a man then his burners calling me screaming
Chicken wing bitches I be finding they just call me jesus
Yeah I  know she got a man but im cool being the other one
Cause he cant get tight when he hear I picked another one
I don't falll in love with them cum and then im done with them
Most they get from me is what pussy is some bubble gum
But this one dude had me laughing
if its one thing that I cant stand it's a baggy magnum
I thought somebody through me a camera they way I caught a flash back
