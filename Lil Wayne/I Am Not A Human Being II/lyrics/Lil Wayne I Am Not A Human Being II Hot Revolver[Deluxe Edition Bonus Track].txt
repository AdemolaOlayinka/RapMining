Lil Wayne
I Am Not A Human Being II
2013)
Young mullah, baby
Umm, young mullah, baby
She says, do you have the time
To listen to me whine
She askin' who's on the other line?
You diss me every time
I tell 'em, baby I'm a star
Shit, I'm above a star
And now I done got so high
I did forgotten who you are
(Are, are)
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Ah ah
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Oh oh oh, ah, oh oh eh eh
Ah ah
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back
Up on the first flight
Right up out of town
Young mullah, baby
Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
(Oh oh eh eh)
Last night, yeah we were spaced girl
You love it, girl, I gotta take off
(Oh oh eh eh)
'Cause Imma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Oh oh oh, yeah oh oh eh
'Cause she say, "Wayne, Wayne"
So she got me all impatient
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscious
While I say aloud

Boy, you got a problem
(Problem)
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver
(Hot revolver)
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself

And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
I told her, I can be with her
But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
That's the problem
Oh my God, then Shorty be whillin'
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
All of the things that she'll do
And all of the things
That she'll say to make me stay
And I be like, 'Damn'
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me
To outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
And then I send her on her way

Boy, you got a problem
(Problem)
And you ain't foolin' no one
But yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one
But yourself
And so she's gone to party town
On her own
And you go by yourself
So all alone
