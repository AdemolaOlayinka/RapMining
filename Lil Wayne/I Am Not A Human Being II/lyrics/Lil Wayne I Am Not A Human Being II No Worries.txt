I Am Not A Human Being II
2013)
You can look me in my face
I ain’t got no worries 
See the sh-roomies keep me up
So I ain’t got no worries
I ain’t got no worries 
You see money right there, yeah,
That’s Tunechi right there (turn up)
Yeah, that’s Mack Maine right there,
And we ain’t got no worries
You see pussy right there
Red bone mangoes right there
See them sh-roomies right there, yeah
We ain’t got no worries

Tunechi in this bitch, everybody should be worried
Them pussy niggas be purring, bitches be digging me I feel buried
And if she make this dick hard, she woke up a sleeping giant
Man your bitch speak in tongues every time we speak in private
Hope your barber shop open cause we got hair triggers
Smoke so much that Smokey the Bear, have to bear with us
And that Jeep with the doors off that means that bitch sleek
All these bitches think they’re the shit, I sent them up shits creek
You see Tunechi right here, give me brain ideas
It’s OK if you turn up just don’t turn off my light years
All I know is I do it what I’m smoking I grew it
These are Blood gang Piru it, all rats gotta die even Stewart
On my private jet is my stewardess is your bitch nigga, bitch nigga
I know gold-diggers and ditch-diggers
You don’t get dissed, you get disfigured
She say, "Sorry, I didn’t shave so that pussy is a little furry."
I put that pussy in my face
I ain’t got no worries
Tunechi


We ain’t got no worries
She bad as a hooker, so she ain’t got no worries
She want me to eat her sugar. I say, "Why you in a hurry?"
She say, "Why you asking questions?" I say, "Bitch, you tryna be funny!"
Now take your fucking clothes off, let me see that donkey kong
I swing your ass back and forth, back and forth on my monkey bar
That camel toe that camel toe, no worries no panty-hose
These niggas falling off like baggy clothes, I smoke more than a magic show
I swear I saw my hoe, I swear she was with my hoe
You know I fuck them both, sore pussy and sore throat
Bitch it’s Tunechi and I’m out here, no worries no worries
I would talk about my dick, but man that shit'd be a long story
(Yeah, oh shit, uh huh, yeah, young mula, baby!)
