California house in the hills, big windows no blinds
Can't sleep past 9, we pass weed like time
Over here, money over there
Her lipstick smell, her pussy look pierced
Daddy gotta go after that and get his
See you later at the dinner, cry crocodile tears
Don't worry I'll be back, cause the pussy like crack
She got a nice swag, and the apple bottom like that apple like Mac
That's that computer love
And get that pussy when I took her to the funeral
Girl I'ma wear that ass out like a uniform
So ride this dick like a horse turned to unicorn
Phone in her back pocket made the EHHHH
Phone in her back pocket made her booty call to say
HELLO! HELLO!
She said "Oh shit! I ain't mean to call you
Anyway, what'chu doin?"
I said "Nuttin," she said "I know what you should be doin
You could be doin" - open up your legs, walk me through it
(Ain't Too Proud 2 Beg), pssh, nigga please
I fell on my hands, and she fell on her knees
What'chu know about that?
UHH! (Hello!) Yeah!
I fell on my hands, and she fell on her knees
What'chu know about that?
Skate! Smoke!
Fuck! Yeah!
