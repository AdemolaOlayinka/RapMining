    "lyrics": "Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields\nThe ashes fall, the wine spills\nThe world stops, drops and rolls\nIt's Judgment Day or a fire drill\nYea, I pour out my heart, have a drink\nThey say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin' yea\nMy country 'tis of thee,\nSweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die\n\nGod bless Amerika\nThis so godless Amerika\nI heard tomorrow ain't promised today\nThe end of time is like a hour away\n\nDamn, military minded, lost and can't find it\nThe stars on the flag are never shining\nUh, I saw a butterfly in hell today\nWill I die or go to jail today?\nCause I live by the sword and die by the sword\nHeard police was looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad\nShootin' stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket\nI'm wired off a socket, but still shockin'\nEverybody wanna tell me what I need\nYou can play a role in my life but not the lead\nIf there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed\nMama said take what you want \u2013 I took heed yea\nMy little breed, yea\n\nBack to life, back to reality\nBeen eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities\nGranted we do it for vanity not humanity\nBut what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love\nI go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged\nAin't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell\nUsed to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail\nSame shit, different air freshner\nI don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner\nTryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind\nTwo fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind\nI be in the cloud, cloud number 9\nAnd I just fucked the clock and let it come to time\nIt's a cold world, I put on a mink\nThere's a chain of commands, I'm the missing link\nYeah\n\nGod bless Amerika\nThis so godless Amerika\nI heard tomorrow ain't promised today\nAnd I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet\n\nHere we live by the sword and die by the sword\nThe police are looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad\nShootin' stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket\nI'm wired off a socket, but still shockin'\nEverybody wanna tell me what I need\nYou can play a role in my life but not the lead\nI saw a butterfly in hell today\nWill I die or go to jail today?\n",
