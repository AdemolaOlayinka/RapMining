I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell\nUsed to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail\nSame shit, different air freshner\nI don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner\nTryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind\nTwo fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind\nI be in the cloud, cloud number 9\nAnd I just fucked the clock and let it come to time\nIt's a cold world, I put on a mink\nThere's a chain of commands, I'm the missing link\nYeah\n\nGod bless Amerika\nThis so godless Amerika\nI heard tomorrow ain't promised today\nAnd I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet\n\nHere we live by the sword and die by the sword\nThe police are looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad\nShootin' stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket\nI'm wired off a socket, but still shockin'\nEverybody wanna tell me what I need\nYou can play a role in my life but not the lead\nI saw a butterfly in hell today\nWill I die or go to jail today?\n",
