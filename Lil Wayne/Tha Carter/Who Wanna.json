Raj I say ya bangin 'em in the..\nRaj I say ya bangin 'em in the head wit this one cut!\nWeezy Weezy say guard ya face bitch\nWeezy say guard ya neck bitch\nWeezy Baby this is the Carter\n\nI move it from a eighth to a slab from a slab to a quarter\nFrom a quarter to a half from a half to a hard one\nYou do the math it's a horror\nWhile I be on the ave gettin off one nineteen for a soft one\nBricks I loft 'em catch him he hot\nIf I catch you without my scratch I'm stretchin ya out\nIf you catch me without the burna burn me\nI beg of you shoot off the leg of you and kick ya in the ass\nI'm dyin of doom I say I'm sick with cash\nThese eyes are real see straight through ya liquid ass\nYou see me straight through the glass house picnic wagon\nYou could see it by my bitch face she thick with ass\nGet slick slick I click click blast on ya bitch ass\nSquad up shit click or smash on ya bitch ass\nSmash on ya bitch ass\nNow pick the grass up out ya ass and the caps out ya cap Aye!\n\n\nWho wanna fuck wit me tell 'em I'm waitin for 'em\nWho wanna fuck wit me tell 'em I'm waitin for 'em\nWho gon fuck wit me I got the blazer for 'em\nWho gon fuck wit me do you wanna fuck wit me Naw!\n\nHustle boy sell a nick to ya mom I'll sell a brick out ya house\nI'll sell a brick to a house nigga\nI'll send a clip to ya mouth back of the gun to ya nose\nFront of the gun to ya clothes I let it rip and I bounce\nLights off young Teddy Pender is out\nMask on scare the fuck out ya but ya ass grown\nI wasnt born with no silver spoon\nBut I can heat it in a spoon and pitch it in a balloon\nTomb sittin in ya room sing for me\nBut if ya don't gimmie no tune the semi go boom\nBut if ya dont hear me doe fool the semi go boom\nI'm try to make moves but they gimmie no room\nI takes my space I blaze the haze take ya babe to space\nShe gimmie amazing face I sung Amazing Grace\nI was once lost but now I'm found\nFull of them pounds is how I'm found Aye!\n\n\n\nOh! Oh! Bang 'em in da head Whoa!\nOh! Oh! Bang 'em in da face Whoa!\nOh! Oh! Bang 'em in da neck Whoa!\nRim low all I can see is the flow now let's go!\n\nI know how to cook so I buy it soft\nI also sell it soft depending the cost\nYou know thats shells they toss defending they boss\nThey wipes 'em well across ya dentures like floss\nYou know I smell ya talk and I swear I knows bullshit and pussy near or far\nYa'll niggaz better gear up for the comin of the boy\nFrom a young'n to a boy to young boy boy\nI dump toys boy at ya punk boy toys\nTake the pump out the trunk take a chunk out a chump\nBaby what have I done I created a monster\nWeezy Baby a gangster no wankster\nHell naw I smell ya'll\nDidnt know Jam Master well but I rocks wit my shells on\nAnd the block still a hell zone\nGet a helmet for you and ya gals dome I suggest! Aye!\n\n\n\nBang 'em in da head whoa!\nBang 'em in da face whoa!\nBang 'em in da neck whoa!\nRim low all I can see is the flow now let's go\n\nBang 'em in da head whoa!\nBang 'em in da face whoa!\nBang 'em in da neck whoa!\nRim low all I can see is ya hoe now let's go\n",
