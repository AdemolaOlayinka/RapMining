Bang! say breathe nigga breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his tee\nSay Bang! Bang! say breathe deep breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his chest...Clear!\nNow the boy is a mess and the block in fear cuz ya boy up and left\nLife is short enjoy what eva's left\nBefore you run into a nigga like me and meet death\nIn less than three seconds I'll pull a three-eighty\nThree feet from my waist\nThree inches from your faces\nMake no mistake Weezy neva hesitate\nI'll pop till your shit separate like eewww!\n\n\nI shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head\nThe heater burner bruisa is on my hip this year\nI shoot your arm, leg, leg, arm, head\nI wish a motherfucker would trip this year\n",
