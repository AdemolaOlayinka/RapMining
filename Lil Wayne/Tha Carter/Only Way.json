Baby hand cocked\nDemand my cheese\nFuck you pay me\nAnd I can't stop\nPlease, what you crazy?\nMan I'm a get it like the man on the chorus\nGot my hand on a fortune\nBang at ya porches, Bang at ya window\nKidnapp ya neighbors, torture ya kinfolk\nAnd tell the cops I murder the infoer\nLeave him on the precinct steps in a pillow\nNiggaz wanna keep they breath then tell 'em get low\nI got ten left in the tech so what they here fo\nNigga you ain't scaring nothin weezy been a tiger in the jungle since a cub\nWith my paws in the mud, yeah me and my paw in the mud\nInterior mayback like what, Bitch nigga!\nIts the Birdman and Birdman Jr\nAnd he ain't got to his son a shoot ya blah\n\n\n\n\nHomeboy you gotta know that avenue\nTo get off a bag or two or you just passin through\nTrue true, and we just passed the truth\nPassin through the streets of the murder capital\nWhere you think ya own brothers after you\nSo you ain't got no other brother after you\nDont let the boys in blue capture you\nCause they got pictures of me at it too\nIts all fucked up\nBossman weezy get y'all touched up\nGat blacked ya face like ya run into a wall or something\nIts cash money all or nothing\nIts Lil Wayne the reverand call it Sunday\nThe congregation know I come with nothing\nBut leave with everything, I ain't come for nothing\nAnd the choir know I come with money\nAnd y'all know I'm Stunnas youngin like dat bitch\n",
