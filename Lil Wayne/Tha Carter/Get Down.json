Hey nigga we done built this.\nShit from the ground up now homie\nBelieve that daddy. It ain't no looking back from here. We too strong\n\n\nAnd that's the only way we get down (We get down)\n'Cause that's the only way we was taught (We was taught)\nAnd everything we got we bought (We bought)\nAnd real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark, yeah)\nAnd that's the only way we get down (We get down)\nAnd that's the only way we was taught (We was taught)\nAnd everything we got we bought (We bought)\nAnd real niggaz still shine in the dark (Still shine in the dark, fuck a law, oh!)\n'Cause that's the only way we get down\n\n\nI down down a brother we ain't cut from the same cloth you Downy soft\nBullets separate ya body compound a busta\nI'ma find ya if ya hiding I'm a bounty hunter\nIn ya home putting dick all down ya woman\nYou come home we in the bedroom counting money\nI bring her home and I fuck her on a thousand hundreds\nThen I shoot the nasty bitch in the mouth for nothing\nI say Birdman Birdman what's good today\nWe ain't never let them niggaz take our food away\nAnd we recognize real and got a rude awakening\nAnd woke up together and our life was better\nI'm the Cash Money son I live a life of cheddar\nNot a rat though hat low Nike is leather\nLil' maw twist to get my life together\nYa bitch meet me at the bar and we night together Cut!\n\n\n\n\nThrow my weight like Sherman Klump\nI gotta hold up my estate like Donald Trump\nAnd I aim kinda straight when it's time to pump\nI bring the pump when it's time to pump\nWrapped around my waist like a cumber bun\nDon't make a nigga pump (clap clap) you up!\nI come in that new thing she threw up\nNow yo' bitch ass gotta clean yo' shoe up\nI'm rich as fuck and I never blew up\nBusiness mug gotta get my loot up\nBet ya bitch get fucked if I ever met her\nBet ya ditch get dug you ever step up\nOne by one I push 'em down fat bullet fat head make a pussy sound\nHard head soft ass make a gushy ground I'm straight from a crooked town\nLike that bitch!\n\n\n\n\nI give my arms and my legs to the game I'm ahead of the game\nI dead any mane if he said any thing but it's cool as long as nigga paid when he came\nAnd I'm a fool wit the flame and the caine\nCut it just a little bit but the drain stay the same yeah\nYoung Wayne and the pain and the stain still remain\nOn the chest where the four made a mess yes\nI'm still here in the flesh 21 year old legend I'ma live way after my death\nI sacrifice whatever that's left\nI give ya'll the last of my breath like...\nWrite it down take a picture record a copy\nPress pause only way you stop me fucker\nI'ma get mine and make you not me\nSpit wine at ya face if you watch me Bitch!\n\n\n\nAnd that's the only way we getting down nigga Cash Money CMB man\nYou already know we here never left fuck 'em\nSee me if you got a problem boy\nI'm at home all day man. It's not a game\nStunna, what's really good with 'em we ain't never let 'em take our food away\nFresh you nasty on this on dawg. Ugh\nThis one, this is the Carter Beotch!\n",
