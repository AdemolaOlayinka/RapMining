Elderly people and twerkers

Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump,
Put your back in,

Put your hands on your knees
And bend your rump,
Put your back in,
Back out do the hump,

And your head is a beepin' target,
You don't want me to see you with my peekin' tourmis,

Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets
Country boy there's something foreign,

Pop up on bicycles,
Pop you all like spot pimples (yup) Wizzle Fizzle
Original hot bizzle,
