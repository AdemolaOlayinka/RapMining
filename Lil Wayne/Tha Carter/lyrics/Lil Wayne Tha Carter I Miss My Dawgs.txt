Yea.yea.yea.yea
This is the Carter motherfucker, yea
And in my building I must keep it real


And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry
Then we get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position and that's when you change position, shit
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya
i know that ain't you in them pictures homie
And I know that ain't you wit that dissing on me
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony

And I ain't got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missing
Gizzle but


Man I miss my dawgs (yeah)
Many nights club poppin (yeah)
Many nights we were blowing trees (yeah)
Many nights we were hustling (yeah)
Man I miss my dawgs (yeah)
Me and you through thick and thin (yeah)
Me and you through the very end (yeah)
For only you I'll sin again (yeah)


And I remember when you came to the click
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit
I got my solja rag and dangled my shit
I was down to just to hang wit you shit
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click
And I ain't even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waiting for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to dump
Cause you my brother chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family ain't filled wit gangsters that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down
Even if you turned around motherfucker
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missing me
Juve but





You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my herb
My main motherfucking man Turk
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble cause we stayed to our self
Member Slim and B leaving, hand the keys over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to the Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunner
Yea those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother
Yea nigga Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The nigga you left behind is my brothers
