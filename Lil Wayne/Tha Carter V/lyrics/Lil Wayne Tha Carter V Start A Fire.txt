I'm like goodness gracious great wall of China
All we do is fuck all day, all ma√±ana
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her
Make her perspire sweat blood and crying
Goodness gracious, great God almighty
She fuck me like a king, Stephen, Martin, Rodney
We break all of monotony, baby we high commodity
They just don't get it

Lets start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline
And they just don't get it
Lets start a fire, watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames
And they just don't get it
Lets start a fire
Mama I'm in love with a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin' yeah we on that R. Kelly
And then she tell me
Lets start a fire

Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire
She ridin' me like a street car named desire
Stop, drop, roll and shake what her mama gave her
Clap that ass like the choir
Oh, I run into my old thing
I say bitch you broke my heart, but thats just growin' pains
Trust me, she ain't nothin' but an old flame
I threw water on that old flame, no more flames
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game
Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane
Now that pussy is my domain
I know they just don't get it

Lets start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline
Lets start a fire, watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames
And they just don't get it
Lets start a fire
They just don't get it
See we already, we already did it
And now we on fire, we on fire
Its me and you
Just don't get it, we already, we already did it
And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah
Mama I'm in love with a a hot girl, and they just don't get it
They just don't get it
Baby I'll be your gasoline
Fuck it, cause Mama I'm in love with a a hot girl
And they just don't get it
Fuck em', cause Mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it
