Shout out Capone and Noreaga\nWe can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later\nDiamonds in my Rollie face, cannot be exfoliated\nThey think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated\nYayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'\nAin't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with\nDead Presidents, them coffins vacant, I must be doin' somethin'\n\n\nHad to get it poppin' off the rip\nRich young nigga that ain't never had to trick\nSlim Thug flow but you know I like 'em thick\nIf she get a job at DOA, I drop her off a tip\nI had to get it poppin' off the rip\nI'm the one they tell ya been reppin' in the 6\nCome into the city and ya niggas get to trippin'?\nWe'll take ya to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff\nWell damn... just be happy for the man\nNirvana, Coldplay nigga got bands\nInk from the money got it all over my hands\nGoin' out to Houston spendin' all of my advance\nV Live just took me for a cheque\n\"Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt\"\nYes right now you are lookin' at the best\nMothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that!\n\nMothafuck the rest\nWhen they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps\nI'd give what I collect before I give up my connect\nIt'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat\nOne finger... slidin' 'cross my neck\nNiggas know what that mean like they deaf\nNigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day\nOn the job and the bitch overslept\nTune stay humble, nigga I'm a king\nNeed a horn and a drumroll\nThey throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga\nI don't step on one rose\nI'm the only one that get the job done\nI don't know a nigga that can cover for me\nTape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach\nShe look like she got a bun in the oven from me\nPreheat... believe me\nAll you gotta do is pay me every week\nI had these bitches havin' babies every week\nI'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets\nGone\n(Believe me)\nRip, rip, nigga\n",
