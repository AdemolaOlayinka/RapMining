I got fuckin' problems\nBad bitch on top of me, she started from the bottom\nOn that Cognac and that loud pack, that loud pack\nYou gotta shoot the rat when it gets too big for the mousetrap\nShoot at me and I'ma smile back and then I \"Pow\" back\nFlip you over like a kayak, bitch it's combat\nBitch I'm Tommy gun Tunechi, favorite color ruby\nMade enough to quit but I keep makin' up excuses\nTriple A dick, that's amazin' and amusin'\nI'm sedated and secluded, I'm the greatest and improvin'\nCause my baby mama say I'm livin' wrong\nWell if I die then I guess she dead right\nCatch me walkin' on this mothafuckin' water, nigga\nI catch your pussy ass at a red light\nAnd you gon' hear that blocka, that blocka\nI represent my killers like Johnnie Cochran\nWe kidnap mamas and toddlers\nWe don't give a fuck if their ass adopted\nBrief moment of silence for Chris Wallace\nSoulja Slim, Pac, Pimp C, I hope they're smilin'\nAnd Weezy still hot as, tamales\nMy private plane got that wi-fi and that wireless\nI'm so sorry for the wait\n\nSpread your legs, girl, I'm tryna break the headboard\nI'm a fiend for the bread, I want the whole DeJ Loaf\nMy Chinese chick just want a blunt and some yaka mein\nShe a squirter so we don't fuck on my Versace sheets\nMy whole crew'll skate on you like a hockey team\nIt's like Wayne Gretzky meets Jeremy Shockey\nWe Young Money Mafia, I rep what I rep\nTry to throw salt on my name and I'll put pep in your step\nPut your gloves on, nigga please get you a grip\nAnd I bet you rest in peace when I let this bitch rip\nThe money runnin' like water, check the cash flow\nMy weed funky like armpits and asshole\nPotato on the nine, when we creep we mash slow\nAnd make sure them kids get everything they ask for\nMy bitch in London said she's a Mack Mainiac\nAnd her sister love Tune, she a Wayniac\nIt's like she's two different persons, she be chillin', she be cursin'\nCry a river, squirt a ocean, fuck fast, in slow motion\nMan I know Soulja proud of me (yah heard me?)\nMan I know Soulja Slim proud of me (ya heard me?)\nTha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late\nAnd I ain't apologetic but sorry for the wait\nTha Carter 5 a classic, sorry that it's late\nAnd I usually ain't apologetic but sorry for the wait\n",
