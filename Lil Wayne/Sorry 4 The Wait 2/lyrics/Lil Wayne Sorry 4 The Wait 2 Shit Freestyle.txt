Sorry 4 The Wait 2
2015)
I'm so sorry, so sorry
This, this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2, and I'm so sorry

Sorry 4 The Wait, nigga, Glock 40 for them fake niggas
Throw a party everyday, nigga, that's an ordinary day, nigga
Bad bitch in mi casa, no mi casa su casa
My choppa go doom da-da dai-yai-yai-yada

Tunechi, bitch, on my Future shit, I'm too legit
I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip, I need another uzi clip, I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real, your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest, but her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5 on a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause' it ain't out yet
She said soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They going have to give they styles back
I say "you too cray", she said "you too humble"
I say "you too, bae", she said "you too sweet"
Then I asked her do she go both ways
She say "they do say love is a two way street"
I said "oooh", talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine, she gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum, I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt, never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees, I sell birds to the trees
Tune, I heard you don't sleep, I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak for that purple, that pink
Yeah, you see what I'm saying like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease, I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats, I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with, she working for me
I personally get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my too fingers I'm at peace, word
I smirk when I squeeze, trigga smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek, I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time in Cash Money, time served and released
But this agent ain't free, word, that's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news, that shit is so yesterweek
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise
They like "Tunechi, you good?" I'm like "Bob, yessiree"
Now don't, I mean don't, don't question me, let me breathe
Dog, big dog, I cock back and shoot at you fleas
Money long, tree trunk, now stand under me, catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees, but repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch, yo, bitch, Tunechi, bitch
I fuck her on my balcony, we watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit, she gonna need lube for this
Cause' I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world, she like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant, she doing lines like a movie script But these are true events, lord
I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box with holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer then nylon
So keep my name out your mouth, I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fucking self, you only live twice, slime
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place where the high crime rate like Iran
We put yo ass on Nightline. I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me, these niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline, but they never try mine
Spittin' like I'm sipping cyanide while my bitch sip on mai tai
But she wine fine, and I'm so sorry, she said "don't be sorry"
Then she said "don't apologize for shit cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit, woah"
