Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!\"\nIt's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas\nPay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas\nI bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga\nFlood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga\nIf you out, you can find me on the street with the work\nIf it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work\nNever slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt\nAnd put your whole clique deep in the dirt\nSmell me?\n\nWho wan' beef with 'em?\nWho wan' creep with 'em?\nAnd when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em\nSee, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em\nAnd when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em\n\nI'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters\nLet my nine-millimeters kill your peoples\nBust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita\nGive me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers\nWow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile\nMe, Turk, G'z and ouch - chicka-POW!\nHow come these niggaz keep burnin the world\nand why the hell this nigga Weezy keep firmin your girl?\nTurnin the wheel on the orange and teal, Bentley drop\nThen I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block\nTell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em\nWhen you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em\nSee this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom\nAnd this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper\nKeep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come\nWayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?\n\n\nNasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place\nBlast the face, automatic attach to waist\nYou bastards play? Then it get awful and bad\nThere will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head\nA nigga either gon' get it right, or they get it at night\nAnd when they spit it, lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice\nHenny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks\nI pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks\nAnd if there's, coke involved then your throat's involved\nI get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all\nMe and my nigga Super Sosa, run up in your crib\nwhile your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her\nIf you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia\nIf you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia\nRecognize it's real and nuttin udder than that\nCause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?\n",
