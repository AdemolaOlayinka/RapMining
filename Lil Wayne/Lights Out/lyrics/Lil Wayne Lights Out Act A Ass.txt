Lil Wayne
Lights Out
2000)
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it 
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it
Act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it

You know them hoes love Weezy
Sticky, pimp small, long hair, big dick
Weezy bring to y'all
Don't y'all lip quit 
Put your lips on this dick
Let me get on some livin'
Spit all over ya chin
Weezy be on some pimp shit
I see 'em, peep 'em, meet 'em, beep 'em
Later on if she ride
G 'em, freak 'em, by the weekend she be fuckin' the squad
I ain't got no loves for broads 
I ducks and dodge 
I grab 'em, on they butts and all
She fucks my dog
Slut sucks nuts and all
And nothin' small
This dick make 'em hit the floor and touch the wall
Call my hoes to get salami, cuz they brush the balls
Let Weezy bust they jaws
Never have no picks and chooses
Cuz I hits and lose 'em
And go to the hotel and switch for ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fire, project girl ta duck wit me
I'm so gangsta pussy chick don't wanna fuck wit me


Titty bop, drop it like it's hot
Make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall hoe
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit

A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some 
Tear that dick down bitch, start all over again
And work your jumpin'

Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta bend ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

That's right, act a fool bitch
Do what you do hoe
After I finish don't get up gotta let Weezy go
You get your props your pussy fire, girl you a pro
So when I'm speakin' I'm creepin' and come get some mo'
You better recognize, you better realize
This is the nigga Geezy, I ain't nothin' nice
Love when you reach out grab, stuff it straight your mouth
Start suck it 'til that middle come out
Ride me (ride me), put that dick inside you (inside you)
After that wiggle your ass and make that juice move
I'ma donkey (donkey), better yet a veteran (veteran) 
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
The Number 1 Stunna, Baby you wit me
Bump in my head never let a bitch play me
Always get the tec nigga fuck 'em all
Wrap a chain 'round ya neck and walk it like a dog


Titty bop, drop it like it's hot
Make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall hoe
Ya gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit
Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit

A c'mon, Tear it down, catch the wall 
Get naked, and show me somethin'
Put that dick down bitch, start fuckin'
And do your jumpin'

Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it
Ya gotta back ya ass wit it, act a ass wit it

See now when Lil Wayne put that dick down
Biznites can't even walk or even sit down
Wipe your mouth off and let me hit now
That Rum got me feelin' real good
The dick hard like real wood
I put it in slow and work it real good
This Lil nigga have a lot a sex
So do me slow, get out the Prada dress
Come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm on blast ma', why you take it slower than its fast time
Flip ya back over, make that ass right
Weezy make ya suck it then taste
That's how the pimp play
Make her friend eat me in this bitch up like shrimp plates
Bounce it in and put a rollin' on A.I. fish black
I got 2 more 'nites is you wit that
Fuck it let's go, when we pop out Lil Moe 
Drop the top part of the 'Dro
Later on I'm touchin' the throat, bare wit it 
Where them hot girls that like that nasty shit
Make'em act a ass wit it, back ya ass wit it


Titty bop, drop it like it's hot
Make it fall slow
Now walk wit me, shake a leg, catch the wall hoe
Ya Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit
Ya Gotta back ya ass wit, act a ass wit

A c'mon, tear it down, catch the wall
Get naked, show me some

And do your jumpin'
