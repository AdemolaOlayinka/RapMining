Slow down, I'm talking bout some get money shit an how its gonna go down
Well holla at me nigga, Talk to me, Let me know somethin'
Cause right now I'm tired of husltin, And these rocks aint doin' nothin'
And to tell you the truth I feel like I be out here for the fun of it
I swear if I don't hit a lick by next month I'm done with it
I understand, But you ain't listenin' you just talkin'
I said I could get you paid, Is you with that offer?
I know you see me comin' thruogh everyday pimpin'
In a Benz, the Jag, and a Ferari
Yea, But I like that Bentely
All thats cool shorty, You can get this if you with me
Let me run it down to ya bout this shipment I'm gettin' in

An you don't even know how long I been tryin' to find me a brick
To make it flip and take the chips and go an buy me a whip

You worry bout your cake
Once you make enough to play
Go buy a Z-28
A Z-28 
Boy go head, Once I get change 
I'mma go an cop me a Range or two platinum chains
Well look I ain't fuckin' with ya
You to young from the start
Man that aint even got anythnig to do with it
Its dedication and heart
Dedication and smarts
Don't put your heart in this game
Cause when you fall to deep in love you get caught in this game
Well correct me when I'm worng 
And acknowlegde me when I'm right

Get yo ass in this car
