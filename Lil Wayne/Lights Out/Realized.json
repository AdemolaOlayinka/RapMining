Wheezy, nigga\nIt's Wheezy, nigga\n\nI don't think you realize what's happenin', dog\nThat lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all\nAnd if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by\nThat's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die\n\nI hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'\nBust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open\nLeave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows\nMe and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes\nTwo pistols, desperado gun busta\nPump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya\nHung under them killers and duck the pigs\nAnd all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big\nAnd, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick\n'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks\nI sticks to what I love, and that's the street\nAnd stay away from what I hate, and that's police\nAnd I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'\nAnd leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'\nWhen we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake\nThe metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face\nWho is Wheezy, nigga?\nWho is Wheezy, nigga?\nWheezy, nigga\nLil Wheezy, nigga\n\nSay, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog\nThat lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all\n\nIt's Wheezy, nigga - Lil Wheezy, nigga\nDon't tangle it, nigga\nIt's time to step down, ya heards me\n",
