Look\nLet's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things\nLeave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains\nAin't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames\nMy guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne\nI'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy\nPlus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it\nOne time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven\nEver since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready\nCome and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever\nNow this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater\nI'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama\nAnd tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma\nBeef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas\nRevolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers\nAnd for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali\nWhen I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family\n\nDon't play with me - I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nYou bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nI pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nAnd I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\n\nWhat is this that done got me in your district? Twist it\nNow everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians\nI'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people\nThen it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people\nSeventeen creeper is who I - what I - be, dog\nThe clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five\nIn heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog\nOn four tires, or feet, dog\nI still be on the block sweepin'\nNobody is not sleepin'\nGot me in all black with a gun in a palm\nRun in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome\nDummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff\ncause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump\nand passin' a blunt - me circle, wants to see if he dead\nGotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead\nBut, dog, you get it raw if you are with the kid\nI'll push your baby momma car off the bridge\nHuh?!\n\nBet' not play with me cause I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\n\nYou might catch me with bandanas and strapped T\nOn the back street of your block in the back seat\nI'ma cap three at the first coward I up and see\nI'ma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet\nWhen I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach\nHope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday\nNigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust\nNow your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff\nNow you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed - add it up\nFresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up\nCrack in the tongue of my kicks\nPlus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip\nI know you see me: Little Wheezy killaholeezy\nA hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy\nYou know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes\nCutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know\nHuh? Huh? Huh?\n\nBet' not play with me cause I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNigga, bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me - boy, I wish you would\nI'ma hit your hood, then split your hood\nNiggas bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun\nThen I pop my gun\nBetter hide and run\nNiggas bet' not play with me\nLook, uh-huh (uh-huh uh-huh)\nLook look look\nLook look look\nWhoa\n",
