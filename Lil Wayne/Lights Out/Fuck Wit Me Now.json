Fuck with me now\nNo, they can't fuck with me now\nCan't fuck with me now\nLet's go\n\nI go by \"Wheezy: the Don\"\nMagnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, and freezin' the arm\nAnd if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off\nAnd if you wonder who the fuck\nwe so sip\nIt's like ain't nothin' but we gotta squab\nOn the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit\nChoppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick\nWe cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it\nWeed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it\nFreak bitch to swallow cum like fluid\nWho it be? Through his feet, Dubbs\nAin't nothin' sweet 'cause I can't keep trust\nLil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga\nReal nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga\nPullin' out the K's, nigga - and all\nWayne 'bout to damage your home\nNigga 'bout to go to see the man in the stars\nHoppin' out the van with bandanas and all\nCannons went off\nNews cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone\nDamn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain\nHow the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame\nThat's because she ran into the game\nNigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne\nCome on!\n\nIt ain't a game, nigga - I don't know who told you it was\nI put holes in your mug if you're holdin' a grudge\nTry to take 'em when you get the gun and load\nand the slug check ya low when I bust\nCome to show you no love\nUh, fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now\nNo! They can't fuck with me now - they can't fuck with me now\nStop playin' when ya get it understood\n'Cause I know if you know what's good for ya\nCome around your hood for ya\nYou don't know me - I kill everyone who show love\nYou have them motherfuckers lookin' all up in the woods for ya\n\nIceberg Shorty - pants is saggin', forty magnum\nComin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'\nTen in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'\nOhh, what's happenin'?\n'round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me\nRunnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic\nNigga put a cap in your asses\nCatch me on the av with the crack and a 'matic\nHopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it\nFirst of the month, just snatched me a package\nBag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'\nIf a nigga think about jackin', please believe\nI be clip-slappin', click-clackin'\nPull the bitch back and run up on his parents\nKidnap for his snacks, and then whack him\nShit get drastic\nThat's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could\nGrab me a freak to ease on my wood\nTransport coke from each of my hoods\nWheezy Whee - CMB's in my blood\nIn the streets seventeen's where I'm from\nAnd I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens\nReally, though, fetticheese is my love\nYou know the streets made me\nAnd I don't give a damn if you hate me\nNigga better be S-Q-A-D\nUntil the bigger man do take me\nSquad shit!\nYou don't want no violence to keep the quiet\nWe call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet\nor we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma\nSo, please stay out it, or you leave in silence\nCome on!
