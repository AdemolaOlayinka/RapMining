I distribute ki's to the kings\nand z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens\nYou need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em\nFrom crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums\nI'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av\nSo get all your money together, come and get my slabs\nI get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half\nAnd still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'\nAnd you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid\nFor the white people, when I get you bricks for ten, I know the right people\nAnd I keep a nine on my waistline\nAnd I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind\n\nI tell 'em, \"Whaaat!!\"\nYou see me hustlin' on the block all the time\nSittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes\nSooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine\nNigga, I'm tryin' to grind\nI tell 'em, \"Whaaat!!\"\nYou see me hustlin' on the block all the time\nSittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes\nSooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine\nNigga, I'm on the grind\n\nNigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots\nI have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', \"Stop!\"\nI hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed\nOn the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee\nAnd if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night\nSo I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night\nSay, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes\n'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes\nAnd the bricks move every followin' week\nSo if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d\nAnd I shower your streets until your av pass out\nMore bricks than the three of your pigs' last damn house\nStack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts\nAnd issue work for half and just grab that south\nFor real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine\nFrom daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind\n\nTell 'em, \"Whaaat!!\"\nYou see me hustlin' on the block all the time\nSittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes\nSooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine\nNigga, I'm on the grind\nI tell 'em, \"Whaaat!!\"\nYou see me hustlin' on the block all the time\nSittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes\nSooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine\nNigga, I'm on the grind\n\nI start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's\nTake seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks\nGotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it\nGotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it\nAnd I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue\nAnd I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move\nAsk them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose\nEspecially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude\nDuck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma\nSometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour\nI pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss\nDrought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss\nCock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun\nAll day I hung the block, I see the cops and run\nI'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine\nYou can find me on the block, nigga, all the time\n\nI tell 'em, \"Whaaat!!\"\nYou see me hustlin' on the block all the time\nSittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes\nSooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine\nNigga, I'm on the grind\n\nLook,\nWhaaaaaa\n",
