I ain't shittin' roses\nWe in the same picture but we all got different poses\nNow I'm looking in my rear view, I see the world in it\nI try to slow down, and I get rear ended\nPause! Like a red light, I'm dead right!\nHighway to Heaven, God do you see my headlights?\nThey say \"you don't know what you're doing till you stop doing it\"\nWell call me clueless cause I do this\nAttention all shooters, I'm a shooting star\nLife is a course and I'm a shoot for Par\nI'm searching for today instead I found tomorrow\nAnd I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow\nYoung Money CMR, blood like a scar\nWeezy F baby and the F ain't for \"Flaw\"\n(Uh)\n(Uh)\n(Yup, yup, yup, yup)\nIt's like I have it all\nBut I don't have to worry\nMarried to the money, a true love story\nOnly God can judge me, I don't need a jury\nNothing standing in my way, like nothings my security\nBack to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me\nIf I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney\nIf you sleeping on me nigga, than I hope you toss and turning\nI'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask yo bitch she will confirm it, yeah,\nNow what we doing with it\nKeep opening ya grill, I'm barbecuing with it\nI know my shit already tight so I ain't screwing with it\nSome say this game is a joke well I hope they get it\nOK, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point\nYeah the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice\nI'm a gangsta by choice I hope my son's choose wiser\nAnd don't call me sir, call me survivor,\n(Uh)\n(Yeah)\n(Uh)\n(And they go yup, yup, yup, yup)\n(Uh)\nCall me killer 'cause I make a killing\nI got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon\nThat's them twin Glocks, you can call 'em siblings\nAnd them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribbling\nI touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails\nThese bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell,\nBut they all on my wire like Stringer Bell.\nI let 'em be, 'cause you know how that stinger feel.\nKnow how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail\nAnd I fuck up any track; train derail\nKnow how to roll, never need training wheels\nAnd when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills\nUh, all or nothing, or nothing else\nI bleed reality, I should cut myself\nJust had a bowl of riches and a cup of wealth\nAnd the \"F\" is for fuck yourself\n(Uh)\n(Yeah)\nAnd I ain't doing nothin' but getting my share\nBreathin' this air\nAnd Mack's mom told me she gonna keep me in her prayers\nSo I'm feeling alright I'm tryna stay aware\nAnd if you wanna trip than I'm a meet ya there\nTo my niggas in the game, keep the game fair\nPlayers play, coaches coach and cheerleaders cheer\nI'm tryna keep spirit when the ghost disappear\nWeezy F baby and the F ain't for fear\n(Uh)\n",
