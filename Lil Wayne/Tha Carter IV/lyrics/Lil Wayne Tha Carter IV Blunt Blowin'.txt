Yeah
I'm a put my shades on
Uh
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurtin'
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes so that's why they mistaking me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause Life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it never mind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong (ha ha)

All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at em
I'm a bad motherfucker, cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb

Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You could look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises (ha ha)
