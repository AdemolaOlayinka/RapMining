Raindrops from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds do fly

Ooh girl, I love you so
Good lord almighty, I’m in love with a whitey
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her
And she give me good love til my nose start bleeding
Life is just like moving mountains
When I can’t cope, I’m hittin’ that slope
That great white hope, and it ain't no pressure
I can’t feel nothing, but I never felt better
Hmm, but you were just no good for me
Killin’ me softly, that girl is poison
Huh, I had to let you go, take things slow
Just so you know

I’d do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

You used to make me feel so good
Like I was on top of the world
I'm sorry that I gotta stay away from ya
But that's what the doctor preferred
My friends told me leave you alone
And I just told em leave me alone
It's sad how our thing had to end, our relationship was short and sweet
Nia Long and I see her in the streets but I can’t bring her home
Man I was on her line all day, no phone, ha
No Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana and truth is

I’d do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane

Sweet sugar hill, yeah I used to climb her
I'd never imagined she turned out to be but a cheap thrill
That sweet turned sour, she gave me power
The world was ours, I used to feel invincible on that flower
But I had to change, yeah I had to change
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane
Now everything is cool, everything is fine
Girl, I’m moving on, I left you behind
Every now and then you pop up on my mind
I might fuck you one last time 'cause..

I’d do it all again if I had the chance
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
I’ll take the whole world on, I’m feeling so strong
Don’t feel the pain (don’t feel the pain)
Like novacane (like novacane)
Like novacane
