Don't you get the house kids cars\nEverything we built together was ours now it's all yours\nThats hard... It's all yours... Good God!\n\n\n\n\nYou comin home (Zora)\nBut the birds are gone (Zora is that a pistol?)\nWith they sad songs (What you fin' to do wit that?)\nThey showin off (C'mon baby put the gun down)\nBut they might be wrong (Shittin me!)\nI really wish you could change baby (well if my best ain't good enough\nI don't know what to tell ya)\nReclaim your throne (I'm the king of this castle)\nDown here in the darkness (c'mon baby hold up!)\n",
