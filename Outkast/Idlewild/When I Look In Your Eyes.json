Yes Mam\nYou're Mighty Fine\n\n\nI've been around the world, seen so many pretty girls\nBut I still get over whelmed when I look in your eyes\nBeen from main to Spain but everything seems the same\nI only feel the change when I look in your eyes\nI know your upper class; I know you got those abs\nEvery man wants to kiss you, and I do too\nSometimes I'm just a clown, and everybody puts me down\nI guess I'll come around when I look in your eyes\nTell me whats a man to do, to get close to you\nI'm just a lonely fool, when I look in your eyes\nDon't tell me no this time, if you do it will blow my mind\nHave you ever seen a grown man cry? It's an awful thang\n\n\n\n\nI guess its time to say good bye, but I gotta give it one more try\nI'm only satisfied when I look in your eyes\nOh please come home with me, oh don't you wanna marry me\nI'm even gonna rub your feet when they stank OUTKAST!\nHow can I let you down, I guess I'm always gonna be around\nI'm simply astounded when I look in your eyes\n",
