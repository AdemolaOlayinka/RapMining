Well I've never been there, well perhaps once\nBut I was so engulfed in the Old \"E\"\nI never made it to the door you speak of hard core\nwhile the DJ sweatin' out all the problems\nand the troubles of the day\nWhile this fine bow-legged girl fine as all outdoors\nlulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear\ncompeting with \"Set it Off,\" in the right\nBut it all blends perfectly let the liquor tell it\n\"Hey hey look baby they playin' our song\"\nAnd the crowd goes wild as if\nHolyfield has just won the fight\nBut in actuality it's only about 3 A.M.\nand three niggas just don' got hauled\noff in the ambulance\ntwo niggas don' start bustin'\nand one nigga don' took his shirt off talkin' 'bout\n\"Now who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?\"\nIt's just my interpretation of the situation\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious Angel\nI can remember that damn thing like yesterday\nThe way she moved reminded me of a Brown Stallion\nhorse with skates on smooth like a hot comb\non nappy ass hair\nI walked up on her & was almost paralyzed\nher neck was smelling sweeter\nthan a plate of yams with extra syrup\neyes beaming like four karats apiece just blindin' a nigga\nfelt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential\nMy heart was beating so damn fast\nnever knowing this moment would bring another\nlife into this world\nFunny how shit come together sometimes\nOne moment you frequent the booty clubs &\nthe next four years you & somebody's daughter\nraisin' y'all own young'n now that's a beautiful thang\nthat's if you're on top of your game\nand man enough to handle real life situations\nCan't gamble feeding baby on that dope money\nmight not always be sufficient but the\nUnited Parcel Service & the people at the Post Office\ndidn't call you back because you had cloudy piss\nSo now you back in the trap just that, trapped\nGo on and marinate on that for a minute\n",
