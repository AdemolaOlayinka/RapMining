Well see your time elapsed\nHave you ever thought of the meaning of the word trapped\nBaboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack\nwas introduced to hispanic communities and blacks\nBut then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention\nCause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it\nMaybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded\nYou scared, she scared, they scared, I said\nthey scared they scared to talk about it\nbout it bout it bout it bout it bout it\n\nIf you scared, say you scared\n\n\nFebruary 1st, 1975's my birthdate\nThe player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday\nI think see, my cap I twist it back from all the dank\nBut if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank\nSo what y'all though bruh?\nI gotta protect my name and what we fought for\nSouthernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer\nNo lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings\nEven though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning\nThe intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off\nBut now it's time I lay low\ncause I believe the track gon' cut off\nPsych, the track is bumpin like pussies on some dykes\nSo if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight\nCause my heart don't pump no Slushee\nYou touch my niggaz you touch me\nI blow up the micraphone like Marilyn Manson, you can't hush me\nYeah\n\n\nHeat'll make anything move\nEven Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool\nJust cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools\nout they rabbit ass mind, don't give me mine, I go off like mines\nblowin suckers to smithereens, we was never folks\nIf we fell out over this lil' cream\nOr let some soft legs come in between our dreams\nWe live like Kings, and die like fuckin men\nI don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down\nAin't no openin up shop, we already established\nYou lap doggin, we boss hoggin\nGrown men, don't beg for attention\nKeep wishin, high heels clickin\nPaper champions, leavin with they feet behind\nZap em for the pumpkin, at twelve\non the bottom bunk, holla at me\nSix to the left, last one, can't turn over with dirt on ya\nSlain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence\nin da head, missin ounces, zip code, eight miles\nSuckas, think I got they package\nbut they still eatin moo-moo, oink-oink\nand fowl-fowl-fowl-fowl..\n\nThe truth hurts, but you can't be scared of it\nSo remember that, OutKast, Goodie Mo.B.\nstill standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin\nStop dyin over this lil concrete and lil paper\nWe get this shit together our power's enormous\nYou can deny the lie but you can't deny the truth\nYou scared, you scared, say you scared!\n",
