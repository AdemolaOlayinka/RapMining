    "lyrics": "Even the sun goes down heroes eventually die\nHoroscopes often lie and sometimes \"y\"\nnothin' is for sure nothin' is for certain nothin' lasts forever\nBut until they close the curtain\nit's him & I Aquemini\n\n\nNow is the time to get on like Spike Lee said\nget on the bus go get your work\nand keep your beeper chirpin' is a must\nIs you on that dust or cornstarch\nfamiliar with that smack man\nThe music is like that green stuff\nprovided to you by sack man\nPac man how in the fuck do you think we gon' do that man?\nRidin' round Old National on 18's without no gat man\nI'm strapped man & ready to bust on any nigga like that man\nMe & my nigga we roll together like Batman & Robin\nwe prayed together through hard times\nand swung hard when it was fitting\nBut now we tappin' the brakes from all them corners\nthat we be bending in Volkswagens & Bonnevilles\nChevrolets and Coupe De Villes\nIf you ain't got no rims nigga don't get no wood grain\nsteering wheel for real you can go on chill out & still build\nlet your paper stack instead of going into overkill\npay ya fuckin beeper bill bitch\n\n\n\n\nTwice upon a time there was a boy who died twice\nand lived happily ever after but that's another chapter\nlive from home of the brave with dirty dollars\n& beauty parlors & baby bottles & bowling ball Impalas\n& street scholars that's majoring in culinary arts\nYou know how to work bread cheese & dough\nfrom scratch but see the catch is you can get caught\nKnow what ya sellin' what ya bought so cut that big talk\nLet's walk to the bridge now meet me halfway\nnow you may see some children dead off in the pathway\nit's them poor babies walkin' slowly to the candy lady\nIt's lookin' bad need some hope\nlike the words maybe, if, or probably more than a hobby\nwhen my turntables get wobbly they don't fall\nI'm sorry y'all I often drift I'm talkin' gift\nso when it comes you never look the horse inside it's grill\nof course you know I feel like the bearer of bad news\nDon't want to be it but it's needed so what have you\nNow question is every nigga with dreads for the cause?\nIs every nigga with golds for the fall? Naw\nSo don't get caught in appearance\nit's Outkast Aquemini another Black experience Okay\n\n\n\n\nThe name is Big Boi Daddy Fat Sax\nthe nigga that like them Cadillacs\nI stay down with these streets\n'cause these streets is where my folks at\nBetter know that some say we pro-black boy we professional\nwe missed a lot of church so the music is our confessional\nGet off the testicles & the nut sacks\nyou bust a rhyme we bust back\nGet get back for real niggas that's out here tryin' to spit facts\nYou hear dat can't come near dat maybe you need to quit\nbecause Aquemini is Aquarius & Gemini runnin' shit like this\nYea yea yea yea\n\n\nMy mind warps and bends floats the wind count to ten\nmeet the twin Andre Ben. welcome to the lion's den\noriginal skin many men comprehend\nI extend myself so you go out & tell a friend\nSin all depends on what you believing in\nFaith is what you make it that's the hardest shit since MC Ren\nAlien can blend right on in wit' yo' kin\nlook again 'cause I swear I spot one every now & then\nIt's happenin' again wish I could tell you when\nAndre this is Andre y'all just gon' have to make amends\n",
