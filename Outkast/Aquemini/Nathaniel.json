I can't take the shit\nTryin to hold a nigga down in this country ass town\nI'm used to smokin chronic movin pounds\nThey got a nigga on some \"Sir, yessir, left right left\"\nThrow me in a hole if my ass outta step\nThey treat you like a motherfuckin slave\nDopefiends, cryin Jesus, swear they saved\nNiggaz better get they game tight\nCause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights\nI'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks\nThey swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books\nI hear so many lies it make me sick\nThese niggaz called ballers sellin dimes and licks\nI can't wait til the day they let me go\nSo I can eat some steak and shrimp\ngrab a mic, and bust a flow\nI'm Audi 5 nigga lights out\nHold it down on the streets until the day that I get out\n\nI'm out man\n",
