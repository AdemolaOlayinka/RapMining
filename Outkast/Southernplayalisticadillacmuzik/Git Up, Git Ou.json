    "lyrics": "Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git somethin\nDon't let the days of your life pass by\nYou need to git up, git out and git somethin\nDon't spend all your time tryin to get high\nYou need git up, git out and git somethin\nHow will you make it if you never even try\nYou need to git up, git out and git somethin\nCuz you and I got to do for you and I\n\n\nI don't recall, ever graduatin at all\nSometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all\nEvery day, I just lay around then I can't be found\nAlways asked to give me some livin life like a bum\nTimes is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own\nNigga, you supposed to be grown\nI agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be\nBut negativity is all you seem to ever see\nI admit, I've done some dumb shit\nAnd I'm probably gon do some mo'\nYou shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)\nWhy not? My music's all that I got\nBut some time must be ingested for this to be manifested\nI know you know but I'm gon say this to you I...\nGet high but I don't get too high\nSo what's the limit 'posed to be?\nThat must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three\nYou need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out\nAin't you sick and tired of having to do without\nAnd what up with all these questions?\nAs act as though you know somethin I don't. Do you have any suggestions?\nCuz every job I get is cruel and demeanin\nSick of takin trash out and toilet bowl cleanin\nBut I'm also sick and tired of strugglin\nI never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smugglin\nNaw, that ain't what I'm about\nCee-Lo is just continue travelin his route\nWithout any doubt or fear\nI know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here\nDid I make myself clear?\n\n\n\n\nWell, uh, git up, stand up. So what's said, you dickhead\nSee when I was a youngsta, used to wear them fuckin broke Keds\nMy mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart\nTold me to jack them weak ass niggaz for they fuckin Starters\nIn the middle school, I was a bigger fool\nI wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool\nI used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles\nThey taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers\nSo in a sense I was Rosemary's baby\nAnd then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady\nHell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em\nBitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em\nSee all the playas came and all the playas went\nA playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch\nYou need to git up, git out, git somethin\nSmoke out, cuz it's all about money, money, money\nYeah I said it, a nigga sportin plats and a Braves hat\nI hang with Rico Wade cuz the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy\nI'm true to Organized, cuz they raised me\nI'm also down with LaFace cuz L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me\nAnd it's cool\nYeah, real cool, get paid, fat pocks and all that other fat shit like\nThat, ha-ha\n\n\n\n\nAlot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me\nThrow me over in the fire, let me get chunky in charge\nLike a piece of one of your spirits, got the mutants mind\nI'm gettin paranoid and steady lookin for the time\nIt's eight in the mornin and ain't nobody up yet\nI got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap\nI'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride\nI'm diggin through the ash tray, hopin to have a good day\nI had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head\n(You got to git up, git out and git somethin)\nNow I know it's on, my day is finally started\nBack up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick\n'84 Se-dun-Deville, steady bouncin out the point to Camerton Road\nThe valley of the Southside flow\nEverybody know about that killa that we call blow, so\nKeep your eyes peeled for the 'cover unit\nCuz they know we're jumpin out a black Chevy truck and want trues to fall\nHere come the Red Dogs, I'm bustin out around the corner in my hog\nDippin from the area, I'm scared\nSo one of these bitches might wind up dead\nCuz I have no time for bail. Fuck Clampett cops. Fuck Elgin Bail\nAnd crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country\nThinkin that my city is the big lick for 96\n94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, Outkast, a vision from the past\nHootie Hoo...my white owls are burnin kinda slow\n\n\n\n\nY'all tellin me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?\nAin't nobody black runnin but crackers, so, why I got to register?\nI thinkin of better shit to do with my time\nNever smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes\nSo let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta,\nY'all could not tell me nuthin, thought I hit that bottom rock\nAt age 13, start workin at the loadin dock\nThey layin my mama off of work, General Motors trippin\nBut I come home bank like Hank, from hittin and dippin\nDoin dumb shit, not knowin what a nigga know now\nYeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down\nI dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool\nWastin my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin pool\nCool is how I played the tenth grade\nI thought it was all about mackin hoes and wearin pimp fade\nInstead of bein in class, I'd rather be up in some ass\nNot, thinkin about them six courses that I need to pass\nGraduation rolled around like rolly-pollies\nDamn, that's fucked up. I shoulda listened when my mama told me\nThat, if you play now, you gonna suffer later\nFigured she was talkin yin-yang, so I payed her no attention\nAnd kept missin the point she tried to poke me with\nThe doper that I get, the more I'm feelin broke and shit\nHuh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST\nSo get up off your ass\n\n\nYou need to...\n",
