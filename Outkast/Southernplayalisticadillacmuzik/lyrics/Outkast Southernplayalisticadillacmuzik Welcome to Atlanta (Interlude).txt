Hi-errr, This is the Captain(?) speaking
We are now descending [unknown]
I'd like to welcome you to Atlanta
We have clear blue skies over Atlanta, which by the way is the home of the Atlanta Hawks, the Braves, and the Falcons
To the far left- you can see the Georgia dome, which by the way still flies the Confederate battle flag

Atlanta has been called the new Motown of the South, and is the home of LaFace Records- Organized Noize productions

If you look to your far right, you can see Decatur, and below you, to the right, is East Point and College Park
Home of the red dogs?, flapjacks, and ridin' true?
And home to the player, the lacs, and the motherfuckin' Outkast
