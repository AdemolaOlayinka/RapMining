I know I am\nAs a matter of fact, fuck being anythang else\nIt's only so much time left in this crazy world\nWake up niggaz and realize what's goin on around you\nPoisonin' of the food and water\nTamperin' of cigarettes\nDisease engineering control over your life\nTake back your existence or die like a punk\nThis is Big Rube, sayin right on to the real, and death to the fakers\nPeace out\n",
