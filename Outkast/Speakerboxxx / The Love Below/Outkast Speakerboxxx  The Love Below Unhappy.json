    "lyrics": "Drowning in the gray cell\nTo dwell in earthly hell\nA pimp warrior fell\nOne-two! Sir Lucious Left Foot in the muthafuckin' booth!\nLucious! (Lucious!) Sir Lucious Left Foot has just entered\n\nMight as well have fun `cause your happiness is done and your goose is cooked!\n\nFirst rule in this thang, never let `em see you sweat!\nNever let `em be a threat and your feelings you must protect `em!\nAs well as your rectum! Must keep self out of harm, out of danger's way\nLet strangers play while you graduate and move on!\nTrue happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale\nUnless you're in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail\nYou would be happy as hell! You thought you was happy until that court date came\nCouldn't abort that case, nobody to take your place\nFamily home at stake, too late to escape and get on the run!!\n\n\n\nOne upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child (Flip that smile upside down now!)\nWhen I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli\nIt was silly, `cause my mom and pop they worked for every penny!\nDidn't have many, but had enought to get by! Enough to get fly!\nOnly to start on New Year off in debt now you forget\nYour happiness came and went\nLike mom and dad's realationship, take a trip\nYou got the potato chips? I'll bring the hot sauce!!\n\n\n\n1979 Dirty South, Local Lounge (Flip that smile upside down now!)\nI never thought that alcohol could ease the notion of the sadness\nNow what used to be a happy home done turned into some bad shit!\nGraphic language, mild violence and the silence of the fams!\nNo members to remember, but I know just who I am\nI've grown into a man and like my nigga said we executed the game plan\n`Cause we got that hot sauce!!!!\n",
