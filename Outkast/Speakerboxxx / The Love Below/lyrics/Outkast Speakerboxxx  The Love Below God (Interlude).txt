God, Come in God
God come in God
Damn you’re a girl
Wow
I guess the reason I’m talking to you tonight is 
Cause I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and 
And I consider myself a pretty cool guy
And I never cheated on any of my girlfriends
Well, except that one time in Japan
But that was just for head and head don’t count right
Thanks God I knew you’d understand
Well, I just feel like
Well to be honest with you
God I just need a sweet bitch

You know somebody no to, not too fast but not too slow
Cause I don’t have it all to do it my damn self
And life aint easy
You know I just want somebody by your side to help smooth
That thang out you know what I’m talking about
And at this point 
I mean I’m not being picky
She don’t even have to a big ol’ ass you know
Just something well proportioned to her body
You know a nice little tail you know
What you say you, you say you found somebody
Is she cute? So when do I get to met her?
Awww, God you are the greatest
Well, I guess I’ll talk to you later Amen oh I’m sorry,
I’m sorry Alady
