Back to the bony of tony\nAsk my grandmama ettamay here and she show me\nHow to be the smooth operator, dominator in the state of Georgia\nHip hops there to destroy ya\nLeave a mother fucker open like a foyer\nHe from the dirt now here come the paranoia\nA lawyer couldn't object or disrespect\nThe technique, Sweat me, wipe off the sweat\nFight off the shit and flush the waste down\nThe pipes of my life flow deep into the ground\nFind my purpose on the surface of this earth is\nPlan it, standards, trust and the purpose\nCampaign in vein for the same lame fame, people obtain, you ought to be detained\nBy the hip hop sheriff, locked up\nno possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me and my ears, and my peers\nI hear the end is near, no fear\nwe disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light\nI hope its peaceful and cloudy cause if its not we gotta fight like, fight like\n\nG-h-e-t-t-o-m-u-s-i-c-k stay down\nO-u-t-k-a-s-t just know that we won't play round\nIf feet don't stank like they stank then they can't swallow dat down\nYour battleship is sunk, I wish grandma could see us\nFind a way to get out, wit out, hit out\nYou dig in, dig out, you get out\nGhettomusick, ghettomusick\nFind a way to get in, the fit in the ghetto\nYou get out, wit out a dime\nGhettomusick, ghettomusick\nI just want you to know, how I feel\nFeeling good, feeling great\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?\nI just want you to know, how I feel\nFeeling good feeling great\nFeeling great, feeling good, how are you?\n",
