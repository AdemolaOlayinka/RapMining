(You got it!)\nWhen Cupid knocks at your door\nYou can't ignore me!\nThere's no need to run!\nSo, Happy Valentine's Day (Hey!)\nEvery day the 14th!\nI may have it all wrong, see\nIf you know what loves mean, well\nWell, somebody tell me!\n'Cuz they just don't believe in me!\n\n\nYa' won't believe in me, but you would fancy\nleprechauns or groundhogs\nNo thank you, Easter Bunny!\n(There's so much fuss about Santa Claus, but see\nCupid will not be defeated!)\n\n\nHappy Valentine's Day\nEvery day the 14th!\nNow I know your hearts have grown cold\nAnd that bothers me\nNow I understand 'cause I use to be a bad boy in my day\nI know you're trying to protect your lil' feelings\nbut you can't run away\nOooh ooh!\n\n\nYa' won't believe in me, but you would fancy..\n(Hey! Don't you supposed to be some kind of player or something?)\nBunny!\n\n\nWell keep on runnin', player\n'Cause I got my good shoes on\nAnd I got 'em tied up tight\nSo, you're going to find out tonightttttttttt!\n\n\nGot a sweet lil' darling back in my corner\nBelow I know I love her, but act like I don't want her\nSurrounded by the lonely, but yet feel like a loner\nCould be an organ donor\nThe way I give up my heart, but\nNever know because - shit, I never tell her!\nAsk me about my feelings I'd holla' that it's irrela'\nI don't get myself caught up in the Jello gella'\nAnd puddin' pops, that others opt to call falling in love, but\nFor the record, have you ever rode a horse?\nWould I like for you to take me to Pluto?\nI said, \"Of course!\"\nBut if you ain't a sweety indeedy, I won't endorse\nHans Solo till I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force\nBe with you, and I'll hit you when better time permits\nFor now, give me examples of why you're the shit!\nBut how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?\nAnd if you do not know me, then how could you be my friend?\n\n\nHappy Valentine's, Happy Valentine's\nHappy Valentine's Day, Happy Valentine's Day\n",
