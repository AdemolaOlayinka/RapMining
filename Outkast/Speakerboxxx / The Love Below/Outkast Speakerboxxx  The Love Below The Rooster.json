Somebody done told you you wrong!\n\nOk, I start out all alone\n`Cause my baby mama left me\nNow there's nobody at home\nBeginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned!\nWell it's some real shit and I'm lving it through this song!\nA moving vehicle took my family\nAs I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room\nI woke up very upset!\nI throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies\nMy daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me!\nIn the wind, she was my friend\nLike Princess Di before she died\nTherefore we tried and tried again\nBut in the end you pay attention to the pluses\nBut the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win!\n\nThrow your neck out! Throw your back out!\n\nRound two, a single parent, what is Big to do?\nThrow a parrty? Not hardly!! i'm trying to stay up outta that womb!!\nOr that p-u-s-s uss! I said uss!\nLuther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed\nSmashed, pushed to the limit! Smash and turned it timid!\nHell everyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked hell\nThe cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold!\nBoth of our tempers were on swolle\nFor the most part you fuss, fight, fart!\nYou build it up to break it down and now take it from the start\nRepeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash\nOf two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign!\n\n\n\nK-O, knocked out by technicality\nThe love has kissed the canvas\nNow the whole family is mad at me\nMy daughter don't want me at her PTA meetings\nAnd then my son he can't talk, when I change him he's peeing\nI think he's pissed!\nI can't dismiss the matter of the fact because he saw you and me argue\nNow the energy is coming back\nSet an example, a positive pattern, keep life on track\nBut I'm married to the music and committed to the wax, tapes and CDs\nBaby please, you make me want to scream!\nYou're on my team starting first string so why are we arguing?\n",
