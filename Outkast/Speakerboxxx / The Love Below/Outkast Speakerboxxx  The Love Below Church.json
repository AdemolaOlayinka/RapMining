What the meanin to all of this?\n\n\nSometimes life can keep you down, with your face all in the dirt\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nNow if you feel that left behind, need to get up and go to church\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh\n(HALL-LE-LU-JAH)\nOoooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh..\n(HALL-LE, LU-JAH)\n\n\nBig, slide into the mode, time to drop a load\nMy life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow\nMy bank account is frozen, I\ndon't think that I can get out this hole\nFeel like the figure four leglock\nLike the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked\nI can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe\nCan't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds\nNo trees, no P's to ease the stress of everyday livin\nBut homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they livin\nThe unforgiven or the unwillin, live a life of sinnin\nAnd expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin\n\n\nBut what about repentance?\nWhat about detention?\nWhat about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?\nBut what about repentance?\nWhat about committing the same sin\nover and over again and again and ah..\n\n\nWhy are we here? Huh? Huh? Huh?\nPlease tell me - what are we here foooooooorrrrrrrrrr?\nOW!\n\n\nLife, is nothin but a dream, so peaceful and serene\nUnless you're bein evil then you on the devil's team\nWell I receive what you want to believe\nBut soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds\nPlease, any man can ask, to get a pass\nor a cleansing of sin to grant another chance\nPerhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel\nTalk to the coach or break out the huddle\nWhatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle\nCause he who lives in the upper room is never gullible\nAs you survey the syllables and sentences\nThe question that I'm merely tryin to pose is as simple as me sayin\n",
