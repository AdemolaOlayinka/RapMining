In your live show (bitin ass nigga)\n\n\nYoung Hov' in the place to be\nBig Boi in the place to be (Young)\nAndre 3000 (cash) shout out to public housin (bitch)\nI brought (holla) the whole hood with me (yeah, yeah)\n\n\nPenelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze\nwith her +Eyes Wide Shut+, before I asked to hit her gut\nIf you brunette, +Legally Blonde+ I might respond\nTake you to +Swan Lake+ and beyond\nAntwan raps on, raps on, clap off clap on\nI switch the flow so quick you cannot fa-thom\nI take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea\nand try to grab one line or sentence\nRhyme repentance, find the illest lyricist\nAnd give him a clean bill of health\nWealth might make you look good but you sound like shit\nAnd your team lookin shitty to death\n\n\nMy nigga Big Boi said, watch 'em as they gawk and they gander\nYou can follow or lead like Commander Picard\nYou can have +The Whole World+\nOr be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand\nthis young player's rhyme\nI foregoed the crime and I focused on rhyme\nFocused on every word, and line\nLike a young Cassius Clay in his prime\nI was born to talk shit and prove mine, and I'm\nthe epitome of raw rhyme\nGot signed, got serious about the craft\nof raw rhyme and I got mine - Aquemini's\nmurderous monster move minds\nDid it so hard that it oughta be a crime\nWhen you see I'm comin holla one-time, holla one-time\nWhen you see I'm comin holla one-time (one-time)\n\n\n\n\nDon't, you, like, to groove\nIn your hooptie on your old, flip, flop, sweatshoes\nTo run yo' tennis shoes\nDon't, it, matter to you\nThat OutKast we got that slump for y'all\nKeep that funk for y'all\n\n\nWhen I'm in the mood I rock the S Dot tennis shoes\nAt the interlude, I got the Gucci flip-flops\nAnd I, fix it up like gin and juice when I'm them interviews\ndudes wanna know what he copped\nAnd where you got that, and how could they buy that\nWhere the million dollar watch at, stop that!\nWhy that, why this, niggaz wanna hijack the flyness\nI'm on a whole 'nother plane\nA whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin\nUnderstand what I'm sayin\nHov' and OutKast, whatchu think about that?\nReally don't matter though what you niggaz chatter though\nAnybody get out of line then you trust\nthat the mac'll go b-r-r-r-r-ap, got you killed for that alone\nBack on the shit, back on the strip\nAnother hit I'm not gon' miss\n",
