    "lyrics": "Hello lord, it's me again, I just wanna make to love the whole globe\nAnd all her girlfriends now don't that make ya mind move\nLike smoke patterns, me on my way to Saturn wit a bomb\nNumb be it view, or Saudi Shawty\nI figure before the first gun blast, they know who gone win\nNow won't that make us all fools\nLike class clowns praying Private Ryan comes round\nSound travels at one thousand, one thirty, feet per second\nNiggaz in the street they want it hurry\nWhen niggaz start biting that's when 3000 starts to worry\nA little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray\nAnswer quick do you know what desire is? \"Huh?\"\nApparently not that's why you get what you got\nNow answer this do you know what fire is? \"Yeah\"\nThe body of hot, the motivator of pots\nSnot, spit, shit are characteristics of release\nAsk your niece or nephew, you think we left you\nWhat the future holds in its sweaty palms\nThank I'm finna vom? Ya move like ya mean it she'll cum\nProm night might excite a down right fight like\nWhite blood cell to the common cold rebel\nNight gets jealous of day play is no longer\nThe feelin gets stronger than Ammonia sticks inhale\n\n\n\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n\nLook at the way you look at me I see it on your face\nAll your hate emanates but you still hesitate\nCause you want inside of my head but don't know how\nTo brainwash me to be a commercial clown\nFuck that I see the way you were, see the way you smirk I'm catching you\nwhere you work\nGod only knows all the trouble that grows\nDeep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes\nCan I blast those who point the finger at me\nWho criticize and talk shit so freely\nFuck XXL you're a size too small\nI should hire Eminem so we can kill you all\nWhether you live to talk shit about the Real\nThen kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill\nI'm the outcast comin to blaze the grass\nOutlaw due to my life that's come to pass\nDre, pass me the glass of wine\nSo I can pour it over my homies grave and mine\nFor all those who fallen and answered when God was calling\nJump into my ragtop and get all in\nI'm the bomb, planted in your car why you frozen\nPop the tape in ignite the xplosion\nThe world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours\nThe world is lost, the world is tossed\n\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n\nWith a one-two punch, B-Real and Andre dropped they verses\nYour homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin clean-up so it worsens\nPeople and persons on the opposite teams oh, yes its curtains\nNo bullets burpin' oh just lyrically twerking\nMaking a statement, when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state\nIs kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day\nJumpin the gun and rushing your flow\nBabbling on the mikie like auctioneer, got the public's ears\nFucked up can't hear, Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at?\nOutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp\nGot this thang lit like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps\nMaking that music that make your neck hurt\nAnd the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac\nSix woofers and four amps, lo pro vogues on swole\nWith the carriage lamps diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap\nCome in peace but then xplode like booty traps\n",
