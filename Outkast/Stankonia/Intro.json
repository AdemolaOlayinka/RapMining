(We're bouncing)\nBounce. Bounce. (We're bouncing)\nTwo times bounce bounce. (We're bouncing)\nWe're bouncing. (We're bouncing)\nBounce. (We're bouncing baby)\n(We're bouncing!) Come on, bounce\n(Bouncing! Bounce baby) Bounce!\nBounce, bounce. (Hey Baby!) Bounce, bounce\n(Let's bounce) Come on, bounce. (Everybody let's bounce)\n(Let's bounce) We bouncing now\n\nAll that bouncing, niggas ain't from the A-Town\nWe got Bankhead right here, southwest Atlanta too strong\n(Break!)\n",
