Don't come un-pre-pared\nI'll be there, but when I leave there\nBetter be a household name\nWeather man tellin' us it ain't gon' rain\nSo now we sittin' in a drop-top, soaking wet\nIn a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat\nHits somersaults without the net\nBut this'll be the year that we won't forget\nOne-Nine-Nine-Nine, Anno Domini anything goes, be whatchu wanna be\nLong as you know consequences, to give and for livin'\nThe fence is too high to jump in jail\nToo low to dig, I might just touch hell\nHOT! Get a life, now they on sale\nThen I might cast you a spell, look at what came in the mail\nA scale and some Arm and Hammer, soul gold grill and some baby mama\nBlack Cadillac and a pack of pampers\nStack of question with no answers\nCure for cancer, cure for AIDS\nMake a nigga wanna stay on tour for days\nGet back home, things are wrong\nWell not really it was bad all along\nbefore he left adds up, to a ball of power\nThoughts at a thousands miles per hour\nHello, ghetto, let your brain breathe,\nbelieve there's always more, ahhhhh!\n\n\nDon't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang\nBombs over Baghdad!\nYeah! Ha ha yeah!\nDon't even bang unless you plan to hit something\nBombs over Baghdad!\nYeah! Uhh-huh\n\n\nUno, dos, tres, it's on\nDid you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?\nLike that there boy and we still stay street\nBig things happen every time we meet\nLike a track team, crack fiend, dying to geek\nOutkast bumpin' up and down the street\nSlant back, Cadillac, 'bout five nigga deep\nSeventy-five MC's freestylin' to the beat\nCause we get crunk, stay crunk, at the club\nShould have bought an ounce, but you copped a dub\nShould have held back, but you throwed the punch\n'Spose to meet your girl but you packed a lunch\nNo D to-the U to-the G for you\nGot a son on the way by the name of Bamboo\nGot a little baby girl four year, Jordan\nNever turn my back on my kids for them\nShould have hit it (hit it) quit it (quit it) rag (rag) top (top)\nBefore you RE up, get a laptop\nMake a business for yourself, boy, set some goals\nMake a fat diamond out of dusty coals\nRecord number four, but we on the road\nHold up, slow up, stop, control\nLike Janet, Planets, Stankonia is on ya\nA movin' like Floyd commin' straight to Florida\nLock all your windows then block the corridors\nPullin' off on bell 'cause a whippings in order\nI like a three piece fish before I cut your daughter\nYo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border\nPity PAT rappers tryin' to get the five\nI'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive\nWhen you come to ATL boi you better not hide\ncause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, hah!\n\n\nDon't pull the thang out, unless you plan to bang\nBombs over Baghdad!\nYeah! Ha ha yeah!\nDon't even bang unless you plan to hit something\nBombs over Baghdad!\nYeah! Uhh-huh\n\n\nBombs over Baghdad! Yeah\nBombs over Baghdad! Yeah\nBombs over Baghdad! Yeah\nBombs over Baghdad! Yeah\n\n\nB-I-G, B-O-I\nAn-An-Andre\nTo the T-O-P\n\n\nBob your head. Rag top.\n\n(1, 2.. 1, 2, 3, 4) (Gimme some)\n\n\nPower music. Electric revival.\n",
