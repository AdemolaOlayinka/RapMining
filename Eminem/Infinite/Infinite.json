    "lyrics": "Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass\nOne time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313\nYou know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this\nFor the 9-6\n\nAyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction\nTo get your brain relaxing, a zany acting maniac in action\nA brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction\nYou look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run\nMy rhyming skills got you climbing hills\nI travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills\nI'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants\nTwist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects\nWe disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up\nTwist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog\nThis is the season for noise pollution contamination\nExamination of more cartoons than animation\nMy lamination of narration\nHit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation\nWhen I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing\nI turn the stage into a barren wasteland...\nI'm Infinite\n\nYou heard of hell well I was sent from it\nI went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...\nI'm Infinite\n\nBust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense\nI got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse\nI greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans\nI foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans\nMy coil hands around this microphone are lethal\nOne thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people\nMC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium\nBattle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one\nImitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator\nThere's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus\nFuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases\nMy thesis will smash a stereo to pieces\nMy accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis\nAnd eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally\nWith entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite\n\nYou heard of hell well I was sent from it\nI went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...\nI'm Infinite\n\nMan I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since\nMy residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O\nSo I'm assuming all responsibility\nCause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's\nMic messaler, slamming like a wrestler\nHere to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler\nNo one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical\nI get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school\nI never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical\nI'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy\nIn fact I can't see, or can't imagine\nA man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching\nThis is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam\nPlus the man who never had a plan B\nBe all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit\nI'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...\nI'm Infinite\n\nYou heard of hell well I was sent from it\nI went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...\nI'm Infinite\nYou heard of hell well I was sent from it\nI went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments\nNow I'm trying to repent from it\nBut when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...\nI'm Infinite\n",
