Cause I'm tired of being broke\n\nCause all I do is yearn a life without a concern\nAnd dream of having a turn to earn money to burn\nMapping out my strategies to get rich huh\nMy desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh\nCause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free\nNothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see\nI'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery\nI'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea\nBut just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree\nYou missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea\nUnconditionally my aspects to cash checks\nMy objects were never to swab decks\nIt's up to you the decision is yours\nIf what you vision is tours, or a mission less course\nWhen shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star\n\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh, cause you can be king\nYou can rule the world, you can do anything\nIt's on you baby, cause you can be a star\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh, cause you can be king\nYou can rule the world, you can do anything\nIt's on you baby, cause you can be a star\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh\nYou know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?\nCause that's it\nYeah\nA million dollars ain't even that far away man\nYo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life\nYeah I hear what your saying,\nlook there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?\nI can't live like this for the rest of my life man,\nbumming rides everywhere I go\nYeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?\n\nYo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business\nI'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this\nFinancial interest is the matter at hand\nI got an adequate plan for stab at a grand\nI grab what I can and do what I must\nPursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose\nThe few that I trust, thems the people that I still got\nFuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot\nThe 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme\nProof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time\nMy crews true and divine, we never fronted\nWe just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred\nInstead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives\nIt's all about a man planning what his future is\nWhat he can do for his to be a star\n\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh, cause you can be king\nYou can rule the world, you can do anything\nIt's on you baby, cause you can be a star\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh, cause you can be king\nYou can rule the world, you can do anything\nIt's on you baby, cause you can be a star\nNo matter wherever you are, you're never too far\nFrom revenue huh\nThat's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player,\nI'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President\nYo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,\nmaking dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?\nYeah\nGetting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,\nyou know what I'm saying?\nYeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know\nYou only live once\nninety six baby\n",
