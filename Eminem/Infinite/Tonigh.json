    "lyrics": "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\n\nI'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs\nDruggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs\nSo here's a toast to federal checks\nHetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh\nWe travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks\nTo find babbling Max, gaffling tracks\nI grapple an axe for them baffling acts\nThe mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax\nStill in my yard when I sculpted the culprit\nThe tall shit that will end up with his skull split\nThen I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back\nButterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it\nBaby all I wanna do is swallow one and two\nSmoke a little bit and follow one of you\nBack home when the party ends\nSo tonight I'm dropping naughty hints\nTo the finest women in the audience\n\nTonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)\n\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\n\nAyo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous\nLiving as scandalous as a television evangelist\nBut I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter\nCaped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters\nI think a living never meant for me\nExperimentally I found a way to spread interamentally\nWhen I stumbled upon this resolution\nBy using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution\nYou couldn't see me with binoculars\nI armed like an octopus\nStep on stage and you get socked and pushed\nTalking that junk like you went black, guarded your back\nCome battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act\nWhen I rap I represent it and will never referee in it\nEvery minute so when I win it you never resent it\nI'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented\nYou got the point when I cleverly said it\n\nTonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)\n\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\n\nEminem is heading skyward\nFor those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece\nof plywood\nI've got miracle lyrical capability all in me\nWith the agility to escape a killer bee colony\nSo get your cameras and capture how miraculous\nI rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was\nI meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this\nI'm hazardous enough already as it is\nWithout you adding fuel to the fire\nI'm cruel to the liar\nWho fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire\nClinical studies show that I'm cynical\nThere's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow\nI'm sure the party people can agree\nThat I'm enchanting, with the romantic\nFreaking the vocals so frantically\nSo throw your hands up in the atmosphere\nAnd let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like\n\nTonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)\n\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nWe don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight\nCause we came here to do this tonight\nTill the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright\n",
