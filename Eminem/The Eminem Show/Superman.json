Buy you ice, bitch if you died, I wouldn't buy you life\nWhat you tryin' to be? My new wife? What you Mariah, fly through twice...\n\nBut I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go\nSaturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday yo\nMaybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow\n'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway ho...\n\n'Cause I can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nI can't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nCan't be your Superman\nYour Superman, your Superman...\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love these ho's\nIt's no secret, everybody knows\nYeah we fucked, bitch so what?\nThat's about as far as your body goes\nWe'll be friends, I'll call you again, I'll chase you around every bar you attend\nNever know what kind of car I'll be in, we'll see how much you'll be partying then\nYou don't want that, neither do I,\nI don't want to flip when I see you with guys\nToo much pride, between you and I\nNot a jealous man, but females lie\nBut I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two\nI'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you...\n\n\n\nFirst thing you say, \"I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day\nI don't see what the big deal is anyways\nYou're just plain old Marshall to me\"\nOoh ya' girl run that game\n\"Hailie Jade, I love that name, love that tattoo, what's that say?\"\n\"Rot in pieces, uh, that's great\"\nFirst off you don't know Marshall, at all so don't grow partial\nThat's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that bar stool\nThere goes another lawsuit, leave hand prints all across you\nGood Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle\nYou want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad\nDon't touch what you can't grab, end up with two backhands\nPut anthrax on a Tampax, and slap you 'til you can't stand\nGirl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans...\n",
