We can see how large\nWhen the music stops\n\n\nI was happy having a deal at first,\nThought money would make me happy but\nIt only made my pain worst,\nIt hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg\nWhen you ain't got nothing left but your word and your balls\nAnd you're stressed from the calls of your new friends\nBeggin' with they hands out\nChecking for your record when its selling\nWhen it ain't, that's the end, no laughs\nNo friends no girl\nJust the gin you drink till you car spin you then\n\nDamn!\n\nU slam into the wall and you fall\nOut the car, trying to crawl with one arm\nAbout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol\nIf my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops\n\n\nLet's see how many of your men loyal,\nWhen I pull up looking for you,\nWith a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil\nI'm revved up, who said what would lead bust your head would just explode\nWith red stuff I'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon\nBraggin about how you shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you\nNiggas, if I was you niggas, I'll run while given the chance\nUnderstand I can enchance the spirit of man\nDeath itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really\nIrks me, you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk\nBe smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark\nHug the floor while we plan tug-o-war with your life, fuck the tour and the mic\nI'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like\nYou high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga your a gonna at night\n\nWhen The Music Stops\n\n\nInstigators, turn pits in cages\nLet loose and bit the neighbours wrist to razors\nYou all don't want war, you want talk\nIn the dark my dogs all bark like woof\nProof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof\nCaved in like reindeer hoofs\nStomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose\nThe more you all breach, the more I moves\nThis hill street, this is hardcore blues\nPut a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)\nOr make the news betcha all you all move\nWhen the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop\n\n\nMusic's changed my life in so many ways\nBrains confused and fucked since the 5th grade\nLL told me to rock the bells\nNWA said fuck the police\nNow I'm in jail\n93 was strictly R&B\nFucked up hair cut\nListen to Jodeci\nMichael Jackson, who gonna tell me I ain't Mike\nAss cheeks painted white\nFucking Presilla at night\nFlying down sunset smoking crack\nTransvestite in the front\nEddi Murphy in the back\nMOP had me grindy and griddy\nMarilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue\nAnd grew some titties\nLudacris told me to throw them bowls\nNow I'm in the hospital\nBroken nose and a fractured elbow\nVoices in my head, I'm going in shock,\nI'm reaching for the glock but the music stops\n",
