    "lyrics": "Hello boys and girls\nToday we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships\nDo you have a daddy?\nI'll bet you do\n\nwho's your daddy?\n\n\nDaddy, what're you doing?\n\n\n\n\nHaha\n\n\nOk then! everybody, listen up!\n\n\nI'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?\n\n\nSomebody, please help him!\n\ni think my dad gone crazy!\n\n\nThere's no mountain i can't climb\nThere's no tower too high,\nNo plane that i can't learn how to fly\nWhat do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you\nThere ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to\n\nFuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls\nI cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar\nInside of a hall, with my framed autographed,\nSunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall\nI'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off\nAll this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off\n\n\nSuck it marshall\n\n\nSo tell Laura and her husband to back off\nBefore i push this motherfucking button and blast off\nAnd launch one of these russians, and that's all\n\nBlow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off\nWhen will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?\n\nHailie, tell 'em baby\n\n\nMy dad's lost it\n\n\n\nThere's really nothin' else to say I, I can't explain it\n\n\nI think my dad gone crazy!\n\n\nA little help from Hailie Jade won't you tell em' baby\n\nI think my dad gone crazy!\n\n\nTheres nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me\n\nI think my dad gone crazy!\n\n\nThere's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie\n\n\nI think my dad gone crazy!\n\n\nIt's like my mother always told me\n\nRana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana,\nand codeine and goddamit, you little motherfucker\nIf you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'\nuh..\nFuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick\nChew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second\nI'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record\nI'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy\nAnd have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose\nThen quit bringin my flows, quit giving me my ammo\nCan't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my\nm.o.\nI wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo\nCatch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more\nAm i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?\n\n\nDad\n\n\n\n\nMy songs can make you cry, take you by surprise\nAnd at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme\nSee what you're seeing is a genius at work\nWhich to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,\nCuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek\nI'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue\nI'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once\nAnd die and come back as vanilla ice's son\nAnd walk around the rest of my life spit on\nAnd kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung\nLike R Kelly as soon as \"bump n' grind\" comes on\nMore pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a\nplane\nAimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,\nScreaming at the sky, till clouds gather as Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade\nAnd thats pretty much the gist of it,Parents are pissed, but the kids love\nit\nNine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers\nI don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither\n\n\n\n\n\nCrazy\n\n\nha ha\nYou're funny daddy!\n",
