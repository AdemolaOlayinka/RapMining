    "lyrics": "'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,\nFeel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up.\nBut you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength\nAnd just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up\nAnd not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.\n\nYo left, yo left, yo left right left\nYo left, yo left, yo left right left\nYo left, yo left, yo left right left\nYo left, yo left, yo left right left\n\nTill I collapse I\u2019m spilling these raps long as you feel 'em\nTill the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them\n'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop pinning 'em\nAnd I am not hip-hop and I\u2019m just not Eminem.\nSubliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hock venom\nAdrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.\nAmoxacillin is just not real enough.\nThe criminal cop killing hip-hop filling a minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.\nYou're coming with me, feel it or not you\u2019re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.\nYou hear it a lot, lyrics that shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.\nFor shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up you bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a fuck.\n\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth.\nTill the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can\u2019t shut my mouth.\nTill the smoke clears out. Am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bones collapse.\n\nMusic is like magic there\u2019s a certain feeling you get when you're real\nAnd you spit and people are feeling your shit.\nThis is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it\n'cause you may never get it again.\nSo while you\u2019re in it try to get as much shit as you can\nAnd when your run is over just admit when it's at its end.\n'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.\nI got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.\nIt goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.\nBut in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I\u2019m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.\nThat's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.\nEven though half you people got a fucking problem with me.\nYou hate it but you know respect you\u2019ve got to give me\nThe press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.\n\n\nSoon as a verse starts I eat it at MC\u2019s heart\nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word.\nI\u2019ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve\nBut I\u2019ll never be served my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.\n'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m clever when I put together every verse\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I\u2019m an addict\nI rap like I\u2019m addicted to smack like I\u2019m Kim Mathers.\nBut I don\u2019t want to go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.\nSo this is like a full blown attack I\u2019m launching at them\nThe track is on some battling raps who want some static\n'Cause I don\u2019t really think that the fact that I\u2019m Slim matters\nA plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest. So...\n\n\nUntil the roof\nThe roof comes off\nUntil my legs\nGive out from underneath me\n\nI will not fall,\nI will stand tall,\nFeels like no one can beat me.\n",
