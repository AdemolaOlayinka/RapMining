I wouldn't be shit\n\nCreep with me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane\nBeen here longer than anyone in the game\nAnd I ain't got to lie about my age\n\nBut what about Jermaine?\n\nFuck Jermaine, he don't belong speaking mine or Timbaland's name\nAnd don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your saying\nI'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked\nWhen I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it\nYa midget, Mini-Me, with a bunch of little Mini-You's\nRunning around your backyard swimming pools\nOver 80 million records sold\nAnd I ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds\n\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\n\nSecond verse, it gets worse\nIt gets no better than this\nAmateurs drink veteran piss\nFrom a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up\nOr confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri\nWill rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you\nBlackballed and make sure you never rap a fucking again\nDre ain't having it as long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate\n\nIf there was some magic shit I could wave\nOver the industry that could save it when I'm gone\nAnd bury to make sure the tradition carries on\nI would\n\nIf I could only use this power for good\nI wouldn't, not even if I could\n\nFrom the hood and I'm a hornet\nAnd I'ma only sting when I'm cornered\n\nAnd I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warning\nAnd swing to knock somebody's fucking head off\nCause I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off\nAnother punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk\nDon't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk\nWhen I was little I knew I would blow up\nAnd sell a mil or grow up to be Attila\nGo nuts and be a killer\n\nAnd I'm something of a phenom\nOne puff of the chron\nI'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again\nThere's no obstacle that I can't conquer\nSo come along with us (Come On)\n\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\n\nNow anybody who knows Dre\nKnows I'm about fast cars and alize, partying all day\nBut I handle my business cause it's work before play\nDon't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet\nHowever you want it, you could have it your way\nYou fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day\nBullet with your name, sending it your way\nThat goes for anyone who walks through that doorway\nCause this is my space, you invade it\nLive to regret it and you die trying to violate it\nFuck around and you'll get annihilated\nEyes dilated\n\nHa, like my old lady\nCause what you say is what you say\nSometimes what you mean is 2 different things\nDepending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things\nLittle hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything\nCatch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back\nI speed write and my loose leaves my launch pad\n\nAnd I can pull any string\nDon't have to prove anything\nCatch a contract on your head\nYou headed West, talk shit about Dre?\nYou better get a vest, then invest in something\nTo protect your head and neck\n\nAnd it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth\nI joke when I say I'm the best in the booth\nBut a lot of truth is said in jest\nAnd if I ever do live to be a legend\nI'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source\nAin't holdin' my fucking breath\nBut I suffocate for the respect\nFore I breathe to collect the fucking check\n\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\nCause what you say is what you say\nSay what you say how you say it whenever you saying it\nJust remember how you said it when you was spraying it\nSo who you playing with huh huh huh huh?\n\nWatch your fuckin' mouth\n\nYo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick\n",
