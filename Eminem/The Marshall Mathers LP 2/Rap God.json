    "lyrics": "Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\nBut I'm only going to get this one chance\n(Six minutes, six minutes)\nSomething's wrong, I can feel it\n(Six minutes, six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)\nJust a feeling I've got\nLike something's about to happen\nBut I don't know what\nIf that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble\nBig trouble. And if he is as bananas as you say\nI'm not taking any chances\nYou were just what the doctor ordered\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot\n\nBut for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a living and a killing off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinski feeling on his nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)\nThis flippity, dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissing match\nWith this rappity-rap\nPacking a mack in the back of the Ac\nbackpack rap, crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nand at the exact same time\nI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that\nI'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic\nI was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop \"F\" bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are having a rough time period\nHere's a Maxi-Pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad\nFor the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece yeah\n\n'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\n\nEverybody want the key and the secret to rap\nImmortality like I have got\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the earth like an asteroid\nand did nothing but shoot for the moon since (PPEEYOOM)\nMC's get taken to school with this music\n'Cause I use it as a vehicle to 'bus the rhyme'\nNow I lead a New School full of students\nMe? Me, I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-W-A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up\nBlow up and being in a position\nTo meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them\nInto the motherfuckin' Rock n'\nRoll Hall of Fame even though I walk in the church\nAnd burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of shame\nYou fags think it's all a game\n'Til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and\nTell me what in the fuck are you thinking?\nLittle gay looking boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face looking boy\nYou're witnessing a mass-occur like you're watching a church gathering\nAnd take place looking boy\nOy vey, that boy's gay\nThat's all they say looking boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a \"way to go\" from your label every day looking boy\nHey, looking boy, what d'you say looking boy?\nI get a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boy\nI'mma work for everything I have\nNever asked nobody for shit\nGit out my face looking boy\nBasically boy you're never gonna be capable\nof keeping up with the same pace looking boy, 'cause\n\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard\n\nSo you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off then I'm reloading\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walking dead\nBut I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating\nBut I got your mom deep throating\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself\nIn the arm and pay homage, pupil\nIt's me\nMy honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize\nWhat I do though for good\nAt least once in a while so I wanna make sure\nSomewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to\nMaybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case 'cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes\nBut sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come trying to\nCensor you like that one line I said\nOn \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP\nOne when I tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line\nAdd an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now\nThat I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from two thousand four though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel\nWith fucking cornrows\nYou write normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new ray gun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya\nLike when Fabulous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag\nAt Mayweather's pad singin' to a man\nWhile he play piano\nMan, oh man, that was the 24/7 special\nOn the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to radio station the very next day\n\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you\"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)\nUh, summa lumma dooma lumma you assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is\nRicochet in off a me and it'll glue to you\nAnd I'm devastating more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know that haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music\nYou make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do\nWhen they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip hop, it's pop.\"\n'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice,\nyour songs you could sacrifice virgins to\nUnghh, school flunky, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nWhen I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue-and-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel\nI'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys\n\"Still chunky, but funky\"\nBut in my head there's something\nI can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and\nHere's what they want from me\nThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had\nThen you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it\nLife's handing you lemons\nMake lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard, be a king?\nThink not\nWhy be a king when you can be a God?\n",
