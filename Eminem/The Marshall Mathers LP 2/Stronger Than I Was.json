    "lyrics": "You used to say that I'd never be nothing without you\nAnd I believe\nI\u2019m shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can\u2019t breathe\nJust lay here with me, baby, hold me please\nAnd I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees\nAnd I'd cry and I'd scream, \"Baby, please don't leave!\"\nSnatch the keys from your hand\nI would squeeze and you'd laugh\nAnd you'd tease, you're just fucking with me\nAnd you must hate me\nWhy do you date me if you say I make you sick?\nAnd you've had enough of me\nI smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge\n\nBut you won't break me\nYou'll just make me stronger than I was\nBefore I met you, I'll bet you I'll be just fine without you\nAnd if I stumble, I won't crumble\nI'll get back up and uhhh\nAnd I'mma still be humble when I scream, \"Fuck you!\"\nCause I'm stronger than I was\n\nA beautiful face is all that you have\nCause on the inside you're ugly, and mad\nBut you're all that I love\nI grasp, you can't leave\nPlease stay here with me, baby, hold me please\nAnd I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees\nAnd I'd cry and I'd scream, \"Baby, please don't leave!\"\nbut you left and you took everything I had left\nAnd left nothing, nothing for me\nSo please don't wake me from this dream, baby\nWe're still together in my head\nAnd you're still in love with me\n'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead\n\n\nYou walked out, I almost died\nIt was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized\nFelt like I was in for a long bus ride\nI'd rather die than you not by my side\nCan't count how many times I vomited, cried\nGo to my room, turn the radio on and hide,\nThought we were Bonnie and Clyde\nNo, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde I\nFelt like my whole relationship with you was a lie\nIt was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?\nCause if you coulda took my life you woulda\nIt's like you put a knife to my chest and pushed it right through to the\nOther side of my back and stuck a spike, too, should've\nPut up more of a fight, but I couldn't at the time\nNo one could hurt me like you could've\nTake you back now, what's the likelihood of that?\nBite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer\nCause this morning I finally stood up\nHeld my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the\nFirst time since you left me and left me with nothing but shattered dreams\nAnd the life we could've had and we could've been\nBut I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in\nPulling myself out of the dumps once again\nI'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit\nI'mma be late for the pity party\nBut you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again\nTook it on the chin like a champ so don't lump me in with the chump-ions\nI'm done being your punching bag\nIt was November 31st today, would've been our anniversary\nTwo years, but you left on the first of May\nI wrote it on a calender, was gonna call, but couldn't think of the words to say\nBut they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay\nAnd I thank you (uh) cause you made me (uh) a better person than I was\nBut I hate you (uh) cause you drained me (uh)\nI gave you all, you gave me none\nBut if you blame me (uh), you're crazy (uh)\nAnd after all is said and done\nI'm still angry, yeah, I may be\nI may never trust someone\n",
