    "lyrics": "Yeah, trying to figure out the difference\nBut I think.. I think the lines are starting to get blurry\n\nI'm in a strange place\nI feel like Mace when he gave up the game for his faith\nI feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints\nGrimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space\n'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face\nI need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous\nThere's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst\nI done quit chicken heads in cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em\n'Cause that's where most of my anger is based\nFuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints\nI just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks\nThen aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's\nI'm frustrated 'cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack\nI'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack\nI'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is\nI'm strapped for battle sucka-duck, crawl out the back, its a bar fight\nPrepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools flying through the air\nAnd bottles breaking, mirrors also\nAnd I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full\nYou done called every woman a slut, but you forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)\nOh my bad, slut\nAnd next time I show up to court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit\nJudge be like \"That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?\nSmart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you\nAnd jump your bones, you're sexy motherfucker\nYou're so fucking gravy, Marshall, I should start calling you \"au jus\"\n'Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo.\nEvil twin, take this beat now, it's all you.\"\nI believe people can change, but only for the worse\nI could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse\nSo satanic K-mart chains panic\n'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words\n'Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker\n(rape your mother, kill your parents)\nAnd these kids are like parrots\nThey run around the house just like terrorists\nScreaming \"fuck, shit, fuck\"\nAdult with a childish-like arrogance\nWild ever since the day I came out I was like \"merits, fuck that\"\nI'd rather be loud and I like swearing\nFrom the first album even the gals were like \"tight lyrics, dreamy eyes\"\nBut my fucking mouth was nightmarish\nAnd from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this\nAnd the opposition felt the opposite\nSometimes I listen and revisit them old albums\nOften as I can and skim through all them bitches\nTo make sure I keep up with my competition\n(ha ha) Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes\nBorderline genius who's bored of his lines\nAnd that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now\nFeel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies\n\nThere\u2019s darkness closing in (evil twin)\nThere it goes again (my evil twin),\nIt controls my pen (my evil twin),\nBut that ain\u2019t me, it\u2019s my evil twin\n(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)\nBut he\u2019s just a friend (evil twin),\nWho pops up now and again (again)\nSo don\u2019t blame me (evil twin)\nBlame him, it\u2019s my evil twin\n\nWelcome back to the land of the living, my friend\nYou have slept for quite some time\n\nSo who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber\nNah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither\nSimpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever\nGet the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3\u2019s\nFeel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'\nBed-ridden and destined never to leave the\nBedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger\nMy suicide notes, barely legible read the\nBottom, it's signed by The Joker\nLorraine said I never can leave her\nShe'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her\nFuck that shit, bitch\nGive up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers\nI'd ever left it to Beaver\nGet them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver\nGolly-wally I bet he registered Jesus\nEver since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny\nWhen on the steps I met Deshaun at Osborn\nI'd never make it to sophomore\nI just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors\nFlip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em\n'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em\nThey were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'\nMade them break out the popcorn\nNow I've been hip hop in its tip top form\nSince N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn\nScreaming \"fuck the police\" like cop porn\nFlipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin\nFuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4\nAnd that includes Biggie and Pac, whore\nAnd I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?\nAnd crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him\nAnd I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?\nBut no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)\nPlease come in, what was your name again?\nHi, faggot\nLook who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there\nTwo rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair\nAnd you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs\nGuess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there\nPeace to Whitney, geez, just hit me\nThat I should call the loony police to come get me\n'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone\u2019d finally admit me\nTo a mental hospital with Britney\nOh, LMFAO, no way, ho\nJose Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no\nHooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony\nHey ho, hey ho\nI sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray\nNo, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an 8-0-8\nAnd a base whether we're fucking of that instead of your face, so\nLet your low-end raise, yo\nTango, what you think, ho?\nSlow dancing in the bowling\nYou trying to hold hands with your homie?\nWhat? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?\nChange that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me\nHoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner\nSuperman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt\nDon't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work\nSo are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work\nBut all bullshit aside I hit a stride\nStill Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed\nAs it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side\nAnd blamed it on him when they tried to criticize\n'Cause we are the same, bitch\n",
