    "lyrics": "came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain\nan asshole, that role think i succeeded fulfillin'\nbut don't think i ever stopped to think that i was speaking to children\neverything was happenin' so fast. it was like i blinked, sold 3 million\nthen it all went blank, all i remember is feelin' ridiculous 'cause i was getting sick of this feelin'\nlike i'm always under attack, man, i coulda stacked my shit list to the ceilin'\nwomen dishin' but really\nthinkin' if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him\nguess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm rippin' shit. but since when did this many\npeople ever give a shit what i had to say? it's just my opinion\nif it contradicts how i'm livin' put a dick in your rear-end\nthat's why every time you mention a lyric\ni thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it\n'cause it gave me an enormous platform, i'm flattered you thought i was that important\nbut you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battled for it\nmad awards, had glaad annoyed atta-boy\nthey told me to slow down, i'd just zone-out\ngood luck tryin' to convince a blonde, it's like telling gwen stefani that she sold out\n'cause i was trying to leave no doubt\nin anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now\nbecause everybody knows\n\neverybody knows, that you're just an asshole\neverywhere that you go, people want to go home, everyone knows\neverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nthere's no place you can hide, you are just an asshole\neveryone knows, everyone knows\nthanks for the support, asshole\n\nquit actin' salty, i was countin' on you to count me out\nask asher roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out\nthought i was history, well god damn honky that compliment's like back-handin' a donkey, good way to get your ass socked in the mouth\nnah, i'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about?\nthe fight was fixed, i'm back and you can't stop me you knocked me down\ni went down for the count, i fell but the fans caught me and now\nyou're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt\nword to pacquiao, mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about\nbetter go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out\nit's poetry in motion like freddie roach when he's quotin'\nshake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin'\neven helen keller knows life stinks\nyou think it's a joke 'till your bullet riddled, but you should give little shit what i think\nthis whole world is a mess,\ngotta have a goddamn vest\non your chest\nand a glock just to go watch batman\nwho needs to test a testicles? not that man\nhalf you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands\nstuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those\nwater bottles in colorado, so get lost, waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping\na black hole and i'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper\nbut i'm takin' no crap hoe, here i go down the bat pole and i'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating\n'cause everybody knows\n\n\nholy mackerel. i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth. i smacked a girl\noff the mechanical bull at a tractor pull\nfor thinkin' we had some magnetic pull\nthen screamed \"icp in this bitch! how do fuckin' magnets work?\"\n'cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable,\nhate to be dramatical but i'm not romantical\ni'm makin' up words, so you can understandable\nit's tragical, thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical\nyou crackin' a joke? it's laughable\n'cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable\nmy heart is truly guarded\nfull body armor bitch, you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you special, you're retarded\nthinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina\nyou're a trainwreck, i got a one-track mind and, shorty, you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49'er\n'cause you've been a gold digger since you was a miner\nbeen tryin' to hunt me down like a dog 'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent\n'cause all of my spare time's spent\non my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'\nonly women that i love are my daughters, but sometimes i rhyme\nand it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther, so, father, forgive me if i forget to draw the line\nit's apparent i shouldn't have been parent i'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents and 'mother' fuck 'father' time\nit ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime\nso even if i'm half-dead, i'm half alive\npoured my half-empty glass in a cup now my cup has runneth over\nand i'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster\ni'm goin' back to what got me here, yeah cocky and\ncan't knock bein' rudolph, so fear not my deer\nand dry up your tear drops i'm here\nwhite america's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird\nif you stare at me and see yourself, 'cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock be\n'cause everybody knows\n",
