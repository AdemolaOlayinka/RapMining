    "lyrics": "2013)\n(What's your name?) Marshall\n(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one\nMy mother reproduced like the Komodo Dragon\nAnd had me on the back of a motorcycle\nThen crashed in the side of locomotive with rap, I'm loco\nIt's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun\nMichelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum\nAbout to explode all over the canvas\nBack with the Yoda of rap in a spasm\n(Your music usually has them)\n(But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't)\n(Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan)\nA Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts of entertaining\nBut docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and\nProbably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting\nPuke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk\nFull of such blind rage I need a seeing eye dog\nCan't even find the page, I was writing this rhyme on, (oh..)\nIts on a rampage, couldn't see what I wrote I write small\n(It says) Ever since I drove a 79 Lincoln with white walls\nHad a fire in my heart, and a dire desire to aspire, to DIE HARD\nSo as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card\nHip hop ain't dying on my watch\n\nBut sometimes, when I\u2019m sleeping, she comes to me in my dreams\nIs she taken? Is she mine? Don\u2019t got, I don\u2019t care, don\u2019t have two shits to give\nLet me take you by the hand, to promise land, and threaten everyone\n'Cause there\u2019s no rhyme or no reason for nothing\n\nNah, (What's your name?) Marshall\n(Who\u2019s your daddy?) I don\u2019t know him, but I wonder\n(Is he rich like me?) Ha ha\n(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)\nNO\n\nIf he had, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up in these rhymes on my pad\nI wouldn\u2019t be so mad, my attitude wouldn\u2019t be so bad, yeah, dad\nI'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens\nWhen the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands, and\nMakes you want to get up and start dancing\nEven if it is Charles Manson who just happens, to be rapping\nBlue lights flashing, laughing all the way to the bank\nLamping in my K-Mart mansion, I\u2019m in the style department\nWith a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart\nWith great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content\nCompletely, despondent, and condescending\nThe king of nonsense and controversy is on a\nBeat killing spree, your honor, I must plead\nGuilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution\nRebel without a cause, who caused the evolution of rap\nTo take it to the next level, boost it\nBut several rebuked it, and whoever produced it\n(Hip hop is the devil's music) Is that me? It belongs to me?\n'Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns\nThat don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep?\nBut lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper\nRappers better stay clear of me, bitch\n'Cause it's the\u2026\n\nIt's the time of the season, when hate runs high\nAnd this time I won't give it to you easy\nWhen I take back what's mine, with pleasured hands\nAnd torture everyone, that is my plan, my job here isn't done\n'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing\n\n(Whats your name?) Shady\n(Who\u2019s your daddy?) I don\u2019t give a fuck, but I wonder\n(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha\n(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)\n\nSo yeah dad let's walk\nLet's have us a father and son talk\nBut I bet we wouldn't probably get one block\nWithout me knocking your block off\nThis is all your fault\nMaybe that's why I'm so bananas\nI appeal to all those walks of life\nWhoever had strife\nMaybe that's what dad and son talks are like\n'Cause I related to the struggles of Young America\nWhen their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles\nNow they're ripping out their fucking hair again\nIt's hysterical, I chuckle\n'Cause everybody bloodies their bare knuckles\nYeah, uh oh, better beware knuckle heads\nThe sign on my hustle says \"Don't knock\"\nThe doors broken, it won't lock\nIt might just fly open, get cold-cocked\nYou critics come pay to me a visit\nMisery loves company, please stay a minute\nKryptonite to a hypocrite\nZip your lip if you dish it but can't take it\nToo busy getting stoned in your glass house\nTo kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out\nMister Mathers as advertised on the flyers\nSo spread the word 'cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out\nCompletely brain dead Rainman\nDoing the Bankhead in a restraint chair\nSo bitch, shoot me a look it better be a blank stare\nOr get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier than\nAll 8 of the reindeer put together with Chief Keef\n'Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah\nEven this rhyme bitch, and quit tryna look\nFor a fucking reason for it that ain't there\nI still am a CRIMINAL\nTen year old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS\nThe last Mathers LP done went diamond\nThis time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD\nWhen will the madness end, how can it when\nThere's no method the pad and pen\nThe only message that I have to send\nIs \"Dad, I'm back at it again.\"\nBitch (who's your daddy?)\n",
