    "lyrics": "I'm getting by with my wicked ways\nI'm loading up and I'm taking names\nI wanna dig my way to hell\nI wanna dig my way to hell\n\nGuess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder\nEver heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition\nIt's what you're suffering from\nWhen you simply don't care if it's an\n80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning\nAnd you can't see the bitch\u2019s hair is frizzing\nCause you got the windows up\nBlaring the system in your Chevrolet Prizm\nThe devil ain't on a level same as him\nPicture someone who revels in straight masochism\nAnd imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping\nSo bad they should put his ass in prison\nA word bully, I verbally abuse verbs\nLike they did something to me personally\nUsed to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it\nNow I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)\nCadillac from a K Car\nMy ass from a hole in the ground, still can\u2019t tell em a-part\nCame straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud\nTo shop at K-Mart and it became art\nAnd I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are\nTo this day I, still get in fights with the same broad\nAt the same Walmart arguing over the same cart\nIn the middle of the aisle whilin'\nI don't give a fuck I don't play!\nBitch you think you saw this basket first?\nYou're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay\nIllest shit you could think I would say\nMind's like a pile of clay\nWhen's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape\nRipped a gaping hole in it\nFlipped out, ripped down the drapes\nTied 'em around my neck\nWent down the fire escape of the Empire State\nSlipped, fell straight down to the ground\nSplattered all over the entire state\nAnd straight to hell, got impaled by the gates\nSaw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray\nWhile I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face\nAnd this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot\nBut by the way, thoughts are getting darker by the day\nI'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J\nIt's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical\nPaint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane\nEvery rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray\nI\u2019m selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat\n$11.99 so come on and pile a plate\nI\u2019m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise\nWith the rhyme I\u2019m spittin' while I\u2019m shittin' on competition\nIn the meantime it\u2019s always mean time\n\n\nI\u2019ve been a career asshole\nI don\u2019t see why these people always got my back\nI done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake\nBut I was put here not by accident\nI had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish\nSlaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit\nI\u2019m coming to get that quarter back\nLike Ndamukong, the drama can build\nYour mama can ask me for my autograph\nCause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book\nBut I sure would fall for that\nYou done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight\nWhen I get on the mic I'mma snap\nMake you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital\nWhen I overdosed woulda caught a flat\nIf it makes you sick to your stomach acid\nIndigestion, my suggestion\u2019s Kaopectate\nIf it feels like I'm running away with the game\nIt's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate\nAll I got is dick for days and insults for decades\nBut I get by with my wicked ways\nLady you can suck a dick til your neck aches\nCry til you get puffy eyes, red faced\nBut I'm leaving on this jet plane\nYou ain't fly, you're an airhead\nAnd I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase\nBut your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space\nCause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods\nOther words don't try to put your heart in a headcase\nCause baby, stable mentally I ain't\nI need my meds, I peed my bed\nI'm going blind, I don't see my legs\nI keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane\nSomeone help me, I think my face is melting\nIf you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain\nThis G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head\nIf you read my mind, you can see my pain\nAnd you'd see why I be this way\nEver since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes\nTold these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game\nCause I'm 'bout it 'bout it\nLike a (like a) fucking (fucking)\nEcho (echo)... (Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle\nSpiraling, here I go, I`m outta control like no\nOther mic go, stab you til' the knife goes - dull\nI'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes\nCoz I'mma sock it to you\nDyke ho, you don't like it\nGet on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle\nAnd ride it like a motorbike\nI'm finna blow the mic the whole night so\nStrike up the fucking maestro, I'm nitro\nAnd hi ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole\nDeeper, and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go\n\n\nOhh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty\nThank you, God\nShit...\nIs that a girl?\nI'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth\nAnd get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M\nAnd lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show\n- Why do I know that voice?\nButtfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it\nLife's too short to not stroke your bone\n- Are you fucking serious?\nSo everybody, everybody\nCircle jerk, touch my body\nWho is that? Where are you going? Come back\nWhy does everyone always leave me?\nHello? Fuck you then\nBlow it out your ass\n",
