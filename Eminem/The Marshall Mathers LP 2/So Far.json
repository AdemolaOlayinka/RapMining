I'll leave on my own terms ass\nHole I'm goin berserk, my nerves are bad\nBut I love the perks my work has\nI get to meet famous people look at her, dag\nHer. nylons are ran, her skirts snagged and I heard she drag races swag\nTuck in my Haynes shirt tag\nYou're Danica Patrick (yeah) word skag\nWe'd be the perfect match, cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag\nMy apologies, no disrespect to technology, but what the heck's all of these buttons you expect me to sit here and learn that?\nFuck I gotta do ta hear this new song from Luda, be an expert at\nComputers? I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica hell with\nPlaystation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda\nNintendo bitch! run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the\nMozzarella on my spaghetti put it on bread make a sandwich with Welch's\nAnd belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health, but\nI think this poor white trash from the trailer\nJed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps ta\nKeep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth\nI managed to dwell within these parameters still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper\nI can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt a\nCreature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter\nWith all these pet peeves, God damn it to hell I\nCan't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones\nI can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell the\nOther day someone got all elaborate and stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox\nWent to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings\nI think my karma's catching up with me\n\n\nGot friends on Facebook, all over the world\nNot sure what that means, they tell me it's good\nSo I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque\nI'd hang it up but the frame is all cracked\n\nI'm tryin' ta be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me\nIn produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed\nOgre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me\nEmbarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova the shows over, I'm hidin' in Kroger's buyin' groceries\nHe just had front row seats told me, sign his poster then insults me\n\"Wow up close didn't know you had crows feet!\"\nI'm at a crossroads, lost, still shopping at Costco's\nSloppy joe's bulk waffles\nGot caught pickin' my nose (aaghh!) look over see these two hot hoes\nFinger still up one of my nostrils\nRight next to 'em, stuck at the light the fuckin' shit's\nTakin' forever to change, it's stuck these bitches are lovin' it\nRubbin' it in, chucklin'\nCouldn't do nothin' play it off \"what you bumpin'?\" \"Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better\", fuckin' bitch\nThey want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it\nThe pressure, they want me to follow up with a\nNother one after Recovery was so highly coveted\nBut what good is a fuckin' Recovery if I fumble it?\nCause I'm a drop the ball if I don't get a grip, hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches\nWrong subdivision\nTo fuck with bitch, quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids I love my city\nBut you pushed me to the limit what a pity\nThe shit I complain about\nIt's like there ain't a cloud in the sky, and it's rainin' out\nKool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out\nBut bitch, I got an elevator in my house, ants and a mouse\nI'm livin' the dream\n",
