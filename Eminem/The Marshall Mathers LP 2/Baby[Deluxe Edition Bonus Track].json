    "lyrics": "One thousand different houses and Munchhausen\nI'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one \"ouch\"\nWhat the fuck'd you hit me for?\nScream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger\nI once encountered a stranger\nIn a dumb gown, black hood\nWith a scythe\nShit I laughed in his face spit\nBitch gave me an extra life, like take this\nNow get your ass back in that game, bitch\nDon't take shit for granted\nAnd don't take shit, give it!\nOnly bull you should take is by the horns\nA mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor\nI Everlast, pen is mightier than sword\nFinish writing then record\nReplenish keep writing more\nNothing's riding on it but your pride is all you're fighting for\nSo you fight, scratch, you claw\nBack's to wall\nNo one was there to catch you fall\nYou pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off\nYou grab your balls, like they're gargantuan and\nAsk yourself how fucking bad you want it\nPull out your pants, for whooping ass and flash it on em'\nNobodies gonna back you in the corner\nYou're a hornet\nNo one's more ig-norant then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at the laboratory, storming\nLike there's nothing that's more important\nMC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it\nGirl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain\nAnd I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?\nI ain't finished bitch\nI meant in half, oil the blades\nNobody wants to play\nThey say I'm a spoiled little baby\nBut\n\nNobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only trying to warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad\nAnd gets to throwing a tantrum\nHe'll fucking flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts baby in the corner\nI'm only trying to warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad\nAnd gets to throwing a tantrum\nHe'll fucking flip on ya\n\nWhat goes through an addict's brain?\nBesides static pain and big daddy kane\nBreak, beats and words\nAn erratic train of thought\nLike splatter paint\nScatter brain\nYeah maybe that explains\nWhy you're back but don't rap the same\nAnd you're looking way thinner\nBecause your hunger got you looking like\nThey took away dinner (chooka)\nSugar ray Leonard wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though\nJust to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat\nWhen you say you're a chooka what chooka what\nNow fling that bitch from your fingertips\nhope it lands on another rap singers lips\nWho can't think of shit\nAnything of wit, that's interesting to spit\nWho's king of this fucking English Lit?\nLet your middle fingers flip\nOn each hand whilst extending this shit\nHow low can you go?\nLower than Chuck D ho\nHear the bass of this in my voice\nRocky's back, where's my Adrian?\nNobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius\nI'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap\nNot a man, I'm a weapon\nWho just happened to be a rapper\nWho just happen to be on the crapper\nWhen it happened I had an epiphany\nIn the bathroom, I'd never be the same after\nNow I'm back with an appe-tite\nFor destruction, the fucking recipe for disaster\nSo let's eat cos' I'm famished\nEvery deed is a dastardly one\nEvil its past it\nEven you asking for me to be\npo-lite to people\nIs like me having my teeth pulled\n\n\nSo step inside of dimension\nThe demented side of a mind\nThat's like the inside of an engine\nWhile I multiply your undivided attention\nBut be reminded that if I didn't mention\nI lose my mind and my temper\nYou'll be the first one\nWho finds him offensive\nGot him climbing the fences\nLost some time to addiction\nBut look up rhyme in the dictio-nary\nI'm in the picture\nEminem is the synonym for it\nI'm an enigma\nFuck it, let's get to the meat balls\nI'm gonna skip the veg and potatoes\nEdgamacater, they are\nShit legends are made of\nSpit treacherous data\nShit that you would say to your worst enemy\nThis wretched is\nWhat you get when you mix Treach with a Jada\nAnd combine em' with Method Man and Redman\nWith meth-amphetamines in his left hand\nAnd in his right there's a sledge-hammer\nAnd pajamas, standing in front of a webcam\nBeating himself in the head, til Russell let's him off deaf jam\nMaybe I need my head examined\nHannibal Lecter with a dead lamb\nHanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan\nI need meds!\nSwear to god 'cause If I go off the edge\nT.I ain't talking me off a ledge man\nHeart throb at a fart, ah nah\nMore like a smart slob, part blob\nThat'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject\nTo the heart and leave claw marks\nAll over the Wal-Mart walls\nLittle baby with large balls\nFuck mud slinging, I'm blood flinging\nThere's nothing on this fucking earth better than being\nThe king of the playground\nI hate the swings but I love being an underdog\nCos when I'm pushed\nI end up swinging up\n",
