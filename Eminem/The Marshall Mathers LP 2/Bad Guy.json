    "lyrics": "It\u2019s like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt\nTried everything to get my mind off you, it won\u2019t work\nAll it takes is one song on the radio you\u2019re right back on it\nReminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off\nAnd left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search\nMaybe I needed to grow up a little first\nWell, looks like I hit a growth spurt\nBut I am coming for closure\nDon\u2019t suppose an explanation I\u2019m owed for\nThe way that you turned your back on me\nJust when I may have needed you most\nOh, you thought it was over\nYou could just close the chapter\nAnd go about your life, like it was nothing\nYou ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine\nWell, I\u2019ve never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha\n'bout to go through\u2019s tougher than anything I ever have suffered\nCan\u2019t think of a better way to define poetic justice\nCan I hold grudges, mind saying: \"let it go, fuck this\"\nHeart's saying: \"I will once I bury this bitch alive\nHide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset\"\n\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth\nBut it's easier to justify\nWhat's bad is good\nAnd I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n\nAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch\nTo think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit\nThink you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?\nNot this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch\nFinish this stitch so you can reap what you sew (sic), knit wit\nThought some time had past and I'd forget it, forget it!\nYou left our family in shambles\nYou expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed\nMay be gone, but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think cause he's been out the picture so long\nThat I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\nAnd the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold\nHave you any idea the shit that I've gone through?\nFeelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to\nNot once you call to ask me how I'm doing\nLetters, you don't respond to 'em\nFuck it, I'm coming to see you\nAnd gee who better to talk to than you?\nThe cause of my problems\nMy life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you\nPoof, then I'm gone, voosh\nAnd...\n\n\nI've been driving around your side of this town\nLike 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now\nFinally I found your new address, park in your drive\nFeel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life\nAnd it's now arrived, and my mouth is fulla' saliva\nMy knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house\nSee, it's sad it came to this point\nSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya\nBut I ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology\nOr your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek\nSo I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window\nLike I reach my full potential\u2013I peeked\nContinue to peep, still bent low\nKeep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo\nSneak all the way 'round to the back porch\nMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this\nYou don't plan for intruders beforehand?\nSurprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?\nGag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack-up a lung\nLike you picked an axe up and swung\nStick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk\nBy one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh?\nNow who's a faggot, you punk?\nAnd here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck\nIt's just me, you and the music now, Slim\nI hope you hear it we're in a car right now\nWait, here comes my favorite lyric\nI'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die\nAnd hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP\nJust to try to get people to buy\nWell how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun\nLast album now cause after this you'll be officially done\nEminem killed by M and M\nMatthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials\nI initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it\nSince you're in love with your city so much\nI figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here\nTwo more exits, time is quite near\nI hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear\nThat sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea\nAs cops appear in my driver's side mirror\n(Oh God, police!! Ah!!)\nHope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least\nNew plan Stan\nSlim, \"chauvinist pig drove in this big, Lincoln town car!\"\nWell gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you\nSlim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!\nNow say you hate homos again!\n\nI also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend\nI'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in\nI'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen\nPerfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin\nNope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in\nWhen they say all of this is approaching its end\nBut you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again\nBack's to the wall, I\u2019m stacking up all them odds, toilet's clogged\nYeah \u2018cause I\u2019m talking a lotta shit but I\u2019m backing it all up\nBut in my head there\u2019s a voice in the back and it hollers\nAfter the track is demolished\n\"I am your lack of a conscience\"\nI\u2019m the ringing in your ears\nI\u2019m the polyps on the back of your tonsils\nEating your vocal chords after your concerts\nI\u2019m your time that\u2019s almost up that you haven\u2019t acknowledged\nGrab for some water but I\u2019m that pill that\u2019s too jagged to swallow\nI\u2019m the bullies you hate that you became\nWith every faggot you slaughtered\nComing back on you every woman you insult, batter\nbut the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters\nI represent everything you take for granted\n\u2018Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper\u2019s persona\u2019s half a fa\u00e7ade and\nMatthew and Stan just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it\u2019s gone\n\u2018Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name\nCameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,\nI'm the hindsight to say, \u201cI told you so!\u201d\nForeshadows of all the things that are to follow\nI'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow\nIf you don\u2019t stop after they call you\nBiggest laughing stock of rap who can\u2019t call it quits\nWhen it\u2019s time to walk away\nI\u2019m every guilt trip the baggage you have\nBut as you gather up all your possessions\nIf there's anything you have left to say\nUnless it makes an impact then don't bother\nSo before you rest your case\nBetter make sure you're packing a wallop\nSo one last time, I\u2019m back\nBefore it fades into black and it\u2019s all over\nBehold the final chapter in the saga\nTrying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle\nTwice, the magic that started it all\nTragic portrait of an artist tortured\nTrapped in his own drawings\nTap into thoughts\nBlacker and darker than anything imaginable\nHere goes a wild stab in the dark\nAs we pick up where the last Mathers\u2019 left off\n",
