    "lyrics": "Mom, I know I let you down\nAnd though you say the days are happy\nWhy is the power off, and I'm fucked up?\nAnd, Mom, I know he's not around\nBut don't you place the blame on me\nAs you pour yourself another drink, yeah.\n\nI guess we are who we are\nHeadlights shining in the dark night I drive on\nMaybe we took this too far\n\nI went in headfirst\nNever thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse\nMy mom probably got it the worst\nThe brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are\nDid I take it too far?\n\"Cleaning Out My Closet\" and all them other songs\nBut regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,\nYou're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom\nThough far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam\nDesert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare\nAnd forever we can drag this on and on\nBut, agree to disagree\nThat gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me\nYou're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)\nMa, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats\nWhy we always at each other's throats?\nEspecially when dad, he fucked us both\nWe're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)\nFurther away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings\nStill got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road\nAnd I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load\nThen Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,\nAnd that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable\nAnd to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but\n\n\n'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though\n'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow\nBut I'm sorry, Mama, for \"Cleaning Out My Closet\", at the time I was angry\nRightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,\n'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes\nThat song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio\nAnd I think of Nathan being placed in a home\nAnd all the medicine you fed us\nAnd how I just wanted you to taste your own,\nBut now the medications taken over\nAnd your mental state's deteriorating slow\nAnd I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though\nBut, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo\nAll you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both\nFoster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours\nBut I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,\n'cause one thing I never asked was\nWhere the fuck my deadbeat dad was\nFuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address\nBut I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus\nOwn a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas\nSomeone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses\nIf I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them\nAnd although one has only met their grandma once\nYou pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers\nMe, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you\nAnd as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me\nAs we pulled off to go our separate paths,\nAnd I saw your headlights as I looked back\nAnd I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad\nSo, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet\nI guess I had to get this off my chest,\nI hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead\nThe stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing\nSo if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar\n'Cause you're my Ma\n\n\nI want a new life (start over)\nOne without a cause (clean slate)\nSo I'm coming home tonight (yeah)\nWell, no matter what the cost\nAnd if the plane goes down\nOr if the crew can't wake me up\nWell, just know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nOh, even if there's songs to sing\nWell, my children will carry me\nJust know that I'm alright\nI was not afraid to die\nBecause I put my faith in my little girls\nSo I never say, \"Goodbye, cruel world.\"\nJust know that I'm alright\nI am not afraid to die\n\nI want a new life\n",
