    "lyrics": "Eminem Has a full line of chainsaws\nEminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem... Eminem...\nMarshall Mathers, Eminem, the rapper... Eminem\nWho can say fore sure?\nPerhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer\nIf science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use\nSociety will reap a great benefit\n\nI walk around like a space cadet, place your bets\nWho's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes\nFuck fuck fuck can't take the stress\nI make a mess, as the day progresses, angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges\nLike this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches with these hedge trimmin' scissors with razor edges\nImagination's dangerous it's\nThe only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess\n'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's\nDespicable I'm sick of just getting' pushed it's ridiculous\nI look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy this kid just took\nMy stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush\nI wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook\nThis fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook\nHe hit me I fell, I got back up all I did was book, now there's using your head\nMama always said...\n\nIf you had a brain you'd be dangerous, a brain you'd be dangerous\nI'm a prove you wrong\nMama, I'm a grow one day to be famous and I'm a be a pain in the anus\nI'm a be the bomb\nI'm a use my head as a weapon, find a way to escape this insaness\nMama always said, son, if you had a brain you'd be dangerous, guess it pays to be brainless\n\nFast forward some years later a teenager, this is fun, sweet\nI just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete\nIt's usually once a month, this is some feat\nI've accomplished they stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? You stumped me\nBut how do you get the shit beat outta you, beat down and be up beat, when you don't have nothing?\nNo valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed\n'Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street from jump street\nBut if I could just get my head out my ass\nI could accomplish any task\nPracticin' trash talkin'\nIn a trance locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans, mama\nThese damn rhymes are failin' outta my pants pocket, I can't stop it\nAnd I'm startin' to blend in more\nIn school this shit helps for sure, I'm gettin' more self assured then I've ever been before\nPlus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch- end of story\nStill in my skull's a vacant empty void been usin' it more as a bin for storage\nTake some inventory\nIn this gourde there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange an extension cord and a ninja sword\nNot to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored\nIronin' board a bench, a wrench, a ore, wench an attention whore\nEverything but a brain, but domes off the fuckin' chain like an independent store\nSomething's wrong with my head\nJust think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause mama always said...\n\n\nNow my mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm\n'Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb\nI was on he bottom of the pile gettin' stomped\nBut somehow I came out on top\n(Oh-oh-oo-oh)\n\nI told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo\nI'm nice ya'II, fuck it, I'm out cold\nNow everywhere I go they scream out go, I'm bout to clean house, yo\nI'm Lysol, now I'm just household\nOut sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out middle America, hear 'em yell out, in terror they were so scared and those kids\nJust about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out my smart aleck mouth it was so weird\nInappropriate, so be it I don't see it\nMaybe one day when the smoke clears it won't be as\nMotherfukin, difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya\nLittle homos get over your fears and phobias\nIt's ok to be scared-straight they said I provoked queers\n'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's\nA stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors tactical practical jokes, yeah\nYou motherfuckin' \"insert insult here\"\nWho the fuck woulda thunk that one little ole' emcee'd\nBe able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?\nAnd boy, they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked\nThis hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got\nThat white trash traffic in gridlock shit hoppin' like six blocks\nFrom a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid October\nAnd God forbid I see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium, y'all cause\nI'll turn into the Unabomber mama always said...\n\n\nInsaneness ain't even a word you stupid fuck\nNeither is ain't\n",
