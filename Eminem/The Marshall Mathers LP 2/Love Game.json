' bitch you serious?\nI'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious\nWhy you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as a cesarean\nYou know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious\nI want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman\nAfter the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' 'im\nHis mouth piece for a Cadillac emblem\nThat's analogy and metaphor for you\nI should win a medal for all the ways I adore you\nThis is me talkin' cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'\nThat ain't what you like, ain't it? what about if I was as famous\nAs Marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool?\nCops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle\nSingin' \"I hope she's good enough\nMeanwhile ya chasing her\"\nChlamydia couldn't even get rid of her, pity the fool and pity the fool in me I'm a live with the\nGame of love, love, love, love, la-la-la-la-la love\n\n\nSo needless to say, I'm feelin' betrayed, snatch my house key off her key chain\nShe jumps off 'Wee-Bey' from the Wire's dick now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater\nHere goes that broken record cliche, it's all my fault anyway she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break\nShe treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a deejay, each day is an Instant Replay\nThey say what we display, is symptomatic of attack behave\nIor, back together, but forgot today was her B-Day\nShe cut me off on the freeway\nSimple misunderstandin' but just as I went to slam on the brakes, that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait\nBitch cut my fuckin' brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin' 73 thank\nGod there's an exit comin' up, what the mother F-U-cock's\nWrong with her, hit the off-ramp, 'til I coasted to a God damn halt, hit a fucking tree now here she comes at full speed she's racing at me, OK, you wanna fuck with me 'eh?\nSnatch that bitch out her car through the window she's screamin' I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave\nAnd created a sink hole, buried the stink hoe in it, then paid to have the street repaved\nWoke up in a dream state\nIn a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray, durin' a heat wave\nGuess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin' next to me in bed\nDirectly aimin' a gat at my head\nWoke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it I'm checkin' into rehab\nI confess I'm a static addict I guess\nThat's why I'm so clingy every girl I've ever had either says\nI got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin' dramatic, man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just\nA fuckin' romantic, I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch! combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex\nI actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events\nI said \"hit the road\", then after she left I sent that bitch a text\nThat said \"be careful driving don't read this and have an accident! \", she glanced to look at it and wrecked\nToo bad, thought we had a connect- no sense dwelling makes\nNever been a more compelling case, than the model covered in L'oreal and Mace\nWho fell from grace eleven stories, for story telling, while the whore was yelling rape\nTill her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more horser than Tori Spellings' face\nStill they swarm the gates\nOf my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace\nLess your Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though you're late, well, the sentiment's great\nBut wait, think there's been a mistake\nYou wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate\nI have infinite hate in my blood\nIt's mainly cause of the game of\nwait, \"dinner at eight?\"\nI have infinite hate in my blood\nAnd it's mainly cause of the game of love\n\nLove, love, love\nLa-la-la-la-la love\n",
