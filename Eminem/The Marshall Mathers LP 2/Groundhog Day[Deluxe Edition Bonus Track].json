    "lyrics": "What is a nightmare? The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare\n\nI used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious\nTill one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop\nAnd got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons\nThen we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching\nMissouri from Michigan didn't work\nSo we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan\nSomeone put me out my misery, I can't do this again\nMom please stick to a decision\nDiscipline, last thing I wanna' do is listen she's like\nLex Luthor, bitch, her rules are kryptonite\nSo the walls and I done lost my power to see through them bitches\nBut I run into them, running through the kitchen\nPretending to be blind, Superman\nCause I had no supervision\nBut I did have a super power though\nI could turn into invisible kid\nDisappear out of sight, like a true magician\nAnd one day uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different\nMusic into the picture and it became my new religion\n\"I remember it clearly, even today.\"\nMove back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Ned\nAlways itchin' for something to do, was flipping\nThrough the radio stations one day\nAnd discovered this DJ who was mixing\nI say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the wizard\nYou ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing\nI'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing\nFor shoes, fuck them stupid pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition troops\nYou get the new LL Cool J cooling system\nMade that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in this\nThat's how I knew my mission\nLittle boom box boomin', spitting\nPracticing numerous rhythms\nWhen I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come true for wishin'\nI remember Proof would visit\nCouldn't wait to play him my new shit, he'd go coocoo ballistic\nGo through the roof for his shit\nIt's like we knew the instant\nWe touched a mic that both of us two existed to do this shit\nNever quit, too persistent\n\"We are a rap empire\"\n\nStarted a group of misfits\nProof had a proposition\nIf we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit\nCome up with aliases, bipolar opposites and\nBe ready to come off the top as sharp position\nIf you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin'\nThey'd take your spot if someone got to rippin' you\nAnd you forgot your written\nOpportunity knocks once, it ain't knocking again\nThey tried ding-dong ditching shit\nI fucking got that bitch in a headlock\nCut off his oxygen Slim snot gourgin\nCock sucking cynder block in the wind\nNow I got my pot to piss in\nSpot in that top position\nCopping over the opposition\nLooking like a dog that's pissing\nLeg up on the competition\nPromising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson\nI'm in a league Muhammad's in\nAli's my colleague bombing them\nProbably end up on top of them\nStomping them like Ndamukong\nI'm rushing like a Urkanian Ladanian Tomlinson\nFlow vomits in your face\nCompetitors fall at my waist\nYou spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face\nSo name the time, place to battle\nBitch I'm still in that mind state\nDon't make me step on you and make you wine grapes\nCry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose\nBut you turds better be careful how you choose yours\nCause feelings scar but egos bruise worse\nAnd the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers\nNow where's your poop birds?\nOoh, no more tripping in bird shit, songs of self empowerment surgeon\nWords of encouragement but this discouraging the rappers\nThe rap games God, but the name's not James Todd?, I'm just a wordsmith\nSo let these words lift\nCause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't working out\nEach verse is more merciless than the first is\nAnd you ain't got to wear no shoes and shirt in this beast? to get served\nBlood thirst, Revenge of the Nerds\nChickit\n\"And it's true you shall not escape my vengeance.\"\nAnd I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone\nWord to Uncle Ron\nI'm turning into a non-humble Don\nYou blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on\nSo stop the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on\nBetter back away from the front row, get gone\nChomp your arm?\nBigger than Dikembe Mutumbo\nI'm the fucking jumbo tron\nI'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna crumble, you bambacluts\nI'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn\nSo mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass\nAnd I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap\nThe GOAT just ate eight acres, and ate the vet\nWho's just to make a path and take you straight to your favorite rapper\nOh look, my notebook looks smoke cooked\nLike the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove, soot\nCharred debris floating\nLike oak wood was burning\nReturn of the no good\nAnd I won't quit\n\n\"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below\nSomething that made Godzilla look like a plane.\"\nAnd I don't quit, won't change,\nIt's like a groundhog's day\nSo grab a hand ya'll cause you may see if I popped your head\n\"I'm a heartless monster\"\nTurn me into\n\"I'm a heartless monster\"\n\"With my dick in your mouth all day\"\nI'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came\nBut the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed\nThere, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing\n",
