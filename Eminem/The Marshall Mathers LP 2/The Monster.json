Excuse me\nFor wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways\nFame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated\nWhen I blew; see, but it was confusing\n'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf\nAbused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)\nHit the lottery, oh wee\nBut with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet\nIt was like winning a used mink\nIronic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink\nI'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep\nGoing cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith\nBut I'm actually weirder than you think\n'Cause I'm\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're trying to save me, stop holding your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothing\nWell, that's nothing\n\nNow, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me\nTo seize the moment and don't squander it\n'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow\nSo I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from\n(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.\nNo wonder you're losing your mind the way it wanders.)\nYoda-loda-le-hee-hoo\nI think it went wandering off down yonder\nAnd stumbled on 'ta Jeff VanVonderen\n'Cause I need an interventionist\nTo intervene between me and this monster\nAnd save me from myself and all this conflict\n'Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it\nMy OCD's conking me in the head\nKeep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking\nI'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying\nDon't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're trying to save me, stop holding your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\nWell, that's nothing\nWell, that's nothing\n\nCall me crazy but I have this vision\nOne day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian\nBut until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at\nMC's, blood get spilled and I'll\nTake you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track\nGive every kid who got played that\nPumped up feeling and shit to say back\nTo the kids who played him\nI ain't here to save the fucking children\nBut if one kid out of a hundred million\nWho are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great\nIt's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back\nIn the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that\nStraw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack\nMaybe I need a straightjacket, face facts\nI am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that\nIt's nothing, I'm still friends with the\n\nI'm friends with the monster that's under my bed\nGet along with the voices inside of my head\nYou're trying to save me, stop holding your breath\nAnd you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy\n\nWell, that's nothing\nWell, that's nothing\n",
