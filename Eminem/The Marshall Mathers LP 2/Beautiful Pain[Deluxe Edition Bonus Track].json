    "lyrics": "2013)\nI can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire\nToday is a painful reminder of why\nWe can only get brighter\nThe further you put it behind ya\nBut right now I'm on the inside\n(Lookin' out, cause)\n\nI'm standin' in the flames\nIt's a beautiful kind of pain\nSettin' fire to yesterday\nFind the light, find the light, find the light\n\nYesterday was the tornado warning\nToday's like the morning after\nYour world is torn in half\nYou wake in it's wake to start the mourning process\nAnd rebuilding, you're still a work in progress\nToday's a whole new chapter\nIt's like an enormous asth-ma\nThunderstorm has passed ya\nYou weathered it and poked it's eye out\nWith the thorn bush that you\nUsed to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed\nSo focused on the bright side\nThen you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner fast the more asserted\nNever looking back\nMay hit the curb\nBut every day is a new learning curve as you\nSteer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve\nBut you have to\nTo avert a disaster\nLucky no permanent damage\nCause they hurt you so bad\nIt's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes\nAnd that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline\nAnd while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant\n\n\nYou're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like\nIt happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life\nAnd it's as though you feel you've died\nCause you've been killed inside\nBut yet you're still alive\nWhich means you will survive\nAlthough today you may weep cause you're weakened\nAnd everything seems so bleak and hopeless\nThe light that you're seekin'\nIt begins to seep in\nThat's the only thing keepin'\nYou from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end\nAnd I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing\nAnd by tomorrow\nYou may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after\nAll the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building\nAnd the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building\nYou're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down\nCause you're so over 'em\nYou could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling\n\nAs time passes\nThings change every day\nBut wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same\nBut tomorrow today's going down in flames\nThrow the match, set the past ablaze\n\nSo feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire\nFrom the heat\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\nIt's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\nBut you've extinguished this living hell\nStill a little piece of you dies as you scream\n\n\nI feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn\nRising, a phoenix from the flames\nI have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine\nNot with fists, but with wings that I will fly\n",
