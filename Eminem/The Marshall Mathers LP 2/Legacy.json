Am I a martian?\nWhat kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?\n'Cause I don't belong in this world\nThat's why I'm scoffing at authority, defiant often\nFlying off at the handle at my mom, no dad\nSo I am non-compliant at home, at school I'm just shy and awkward\nAnd I don't need no goddamn psychologist\nTryna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems\nThinking he can try and solve them\nI'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk\nAnd in the front drive talking to myself\nEither that or inside hiding off in the corner somewhere quiet\nTrying not to be noticed 'cause I'm crying and sobbing\nI had a bad day at school so I ain't talking\nSome cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker\n'Cause he said that I eyeballed him\nAnd if you fall, I'll get you there\nI'll be your savior from all the wars that are fought\nInside your world\nPlease have faith in my words\n'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThis is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThere's no guarantee,\nIt's not up to me,\nWe can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy\nLegacy, legacy\n\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling\nWhy am I so differently wired in my noggin?\n'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling\n'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit\nBothers me but not my father, he said Sayonara then split\nBut I don't give a shit I'm fine long as\nThere's batteries in my Walkman nothing's the matter with me\nShit look on the bright side at least I ain't walking\nI bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment\nComplex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I\nFind in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it\nHeadphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit\nBut if this is all there is for me life offers\nWhy bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense\nBut I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience\nWhat about them rhymes I've been jottin'\nThey're kinda giving me confidence\nInstead of tryna escape through my comics,\nWhy don't I just blast a little something like Onyx\nTo put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that\nSay what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him\nGrab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch\nWho would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on that\nI could be iconic, and my conquest\nIs word to Phife Dawg from a tribe called Quest\nThis is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThis is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThere's no guarantee,\nIt's not up to me,\nWe can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy\nLegacy, legacy\n\nI used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling\nNow I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome\n'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work\nWords like this and connect lines like crosswords\nAnd use my enemy's words as strength\nTo try and draw from, and get inspired off em\n'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit\nBy you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit\nNow you shut up bitch, I am talking\nThought I was full of horseshit and now\nYou fucking worship the ground in which I am walking\nMe against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins\nVersus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense\nSo bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins\nIt's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins\n'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers\nYou gon' die a ball licker I've been diabolical\nWith this dialogue since 99 Rawkus\nYou don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can\nSuck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass\nIn a flying saucer full of Italian sausage\nThe most high exalting and I ain't halting\nTill I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes\nThe best part about me is I am not you\nI'm me and I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my\nLegacy, legacy, eh\nThis is my legacy, legacy, eh\nThere's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see\nThis is my legacy, legacy\nLegacy, legacy\n",
