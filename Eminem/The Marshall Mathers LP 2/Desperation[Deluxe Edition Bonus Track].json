That's what I call the cost to splurge\nYou drive me bonkers, I\u2019m about to get my swerve on for sure\nThought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first\nDate cause I think I gave you power, when I gave you flowers in a vase\nA box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs\nProbably should've never let me call that job of yours\nTo talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work\nShould've been one of the first signs to cause alert\nMan we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her\nCause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me\nCause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love\n\nYou know this ain't love, you know this ain't love\nYou know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)\nIt's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)\nIt's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)\n(And I here I go again)\n\nYou were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you\nTill I went to the lengths I did to meet you\nCause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning\nNow I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery, ah\nCause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you\nAnd I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in\nWe stuck to each other's hips and we can't\nDo anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone\nCan't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason\nThis definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you\nAnd you pretend to be as mentally and physically\nAddicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer\nDon't wanna be without you\nDon't wanna be with you neither, bitch\nPut me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek\nCause this ain't love\n\n\nJust want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else\n\"What the fuck you whispering for?\nYou get on my nerves, you make me sick\nI think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz\nI mean it's time that we just split and leave the\nGames behind your frame of mind ain't the same as mine\nI think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too\"\nGet the picture\nThat's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up\nTo the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's\nYou better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up\nI'm just mad the time it took to discover\nYou were using me for loot like I used you for looks\nOh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah\nToots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack\nBut I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back\nShe said, \"The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?\"\nShe grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head\nI barely ducked and that's right\nWhen she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe\nGirl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights\n",
