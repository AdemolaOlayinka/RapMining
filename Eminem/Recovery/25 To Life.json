I didn't feel special when I was with you\nAll I ever felt was this\nHelplessness\nImprisoned by a selfish bitch\nChew me up and spit me out\nI fell for this so many times\nIt's ridiculous\nAnd still I stick with this\nI'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction\nYou're addictive as they get\nEvil as they come vindictive as they make em\nMy friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from\nI'm addicted\nTo the pain, the stress, the drama\nI'm drawn in so I guess imma mess\nCursed and blessed\nBut this time imma\nAin't changing my mind\nI'm climbing out this abyss\nYou screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed\nBut when you spoke of people who meant the most to you\nYou left me off your list\nFuck you hip-hop\nI'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch\nAnd it's just\n\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase\n25 to life\n( I'm gone, man)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase\n25 to life\nToo late\nCaught in a chase\n25 to life\n",
