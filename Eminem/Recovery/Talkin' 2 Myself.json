You gon' start dissin people for no reason?\nEspecially when you can't even write a decent punchline even\nYou're lying to yourself, you're slowly dying, you're denying\nYour health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help\n\n\n\nMarshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow\nAll I know is I'm wallowin', self-loathing and hollow\nBottoms up on the pill bottle\nMaybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow\nMy sorrow echoes in this hall though\nBut I must be talkin to the wall though\nI don't see nobody else (I guess I keep talkin to myself)\nBut all these other rappers suck is all that I know\nI've turned into a hater, I've put up a false bravado\nBut Marshall is not a egomaniac that's not his motto\nHe's not a desperado he's desperate, it's starting to bottle inside 'em\nOne foot on the brake one on the throttle\nFallin asleep with writers block in the parking lot of McDonald's\nBut instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something about it\nAdmit you got a problem you brain is clouded you pouted long enough\nIt isn't them it's you you fuckin baby\nQuit worrying about what they do and do shady\nI'm fucking going crazy\n\n\n\nSo I pick myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned\nHit my bottom so hard I bounced twice suffice this time around\nIt's different them last two albums didn't count\nEncore I was on drugs, Relapse I was flushing em out\nI've come to make it up to you no more fucking around\nI've got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I've let em down\nSo please accept my apology I finally feel like I'm back to normal\nI feel like me again, let me formally reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know\nThe new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no\nSigns of slowin up, pullin up, blowin up, all over\nMy life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos\nI'm back with a vengeance, homie, Weezy keep ya head up,\nT.I., keep ya head up, Kanye, keep ya head up,\nDon't let up, keep slayin em\nRest in Peace to DJ AM\nCause I know what it's like\nI struggle with this shit every single day\n\n\n\nSo there it is (there it is)\nDamn\nIt feels like I just woke up or something\nI guess I just... forgot who the fuck I was man\nAy yo\nAnd to anybody who thought about going there, it was never nothing personal, some shit I was going through\nAnd to everybody else...\nI'm back! (I'm back) haha\n",
