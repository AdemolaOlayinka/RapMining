Let's go!\nBetter watch out, now\nHere we come (come)\nAnd we ain't stoppin' until\nWe see the mornin' sun (sun)\nSo give us room to do our thing\nCause we ain't come to hurt no one (one)\nSo everybody come on get up on the floor\nRight now and grab someone (one)\n\nNow first of all I'm the boss\nI just wanna get that across\nMan even my Dentist hates when I floss\nPull up to the club in a Pinto likes it's a Porsche\nGarbage bag for one of the windows\nSpray-painted doors with the flames on 'em\nMichigan plates and my name's on 'em\nBaby, Shady's here come on get him\nIf you dames want 'em\nBut he ain't stupid so quit tryin' to run them games on him\nHe's immune to Cupid, why you tryin' to put your claims on him?\nCause you won't do to me what you did to the last man\nNow climb in back try not to kick over the gas can\nThere's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance\nWe have of just gettin' home, now could I get that lap dance?\nShe's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man\nIn the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps\nThat means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps\nDown and show this hussy who's the man\nNow, get in, dance!\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody!\nAin't nothin' but a White Trash Party!\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks\nIt ain't no one but us trash\nYou dunno, you better ask somebody\nCause we're havin' a White Trash Party!\n\nPull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear\nAnd walk around the party without a care\nLike a body without a head\nLookin' like a zombie from Night of the Livin' Dead\nAnd tomorrow I probably still be too high to get outta bed\nTil I feel like I been hit wit the sharp part'a the hammer\nMixin' Hennessey and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta\nI shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' \"Die Santa!\"\nMissed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders\nSo quit tryin' ta play the wall like you balling\nGet on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'\nThey call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darlin'\nCause as soon as they throw on some R-Kelly I start ballin'\nMakin' it rain for the ladies in the mini's\nBut I'm not throwin' ones, fives, tens, or even twenties\nI'm throwin' quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies\nMan I do this for them bunnies up at Denny's\nFrom the north, east and west, but when\nIt comes to them trailers in them South Parks\nMuffle it, cause homie that hood's tighter than Kenny's\nSo ladies if your belly button's not an innie then I'm outie\nNow hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy\nC'mon\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody!\nAin't nothin' but a White Trash Party!\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks\nIf there ain't no one but us trash\nYou dunno, you better ask somebody\nCause we're havin' a White Trash Party!\n\nNow whether you're black, white or purple\nIf you're misunderstood\nBut you don't give a fuck\nYou ain't doin' shit that you should\nLong as you know you're up to evil\nAnd you're no damn good\nGet on the floor, man, and rep your 'hood\nNow honey, don't let them pricks trip\nWe should make a quick dip\nAnd go do some donuts in the hospital parkin' lot\nCause girl I got a sick wip\nKick the back window outta my Gremlin\nPut two milk crates in the trunk\nRip out the stick shift and\nMake a five seater\nI'll be damned if I feed a chick\nIt ain't like me to split a piece 'a dry pita\nI'll be the S-L to the I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y\nAnd I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater\nI'll rip a tree out the ground\nAnd flip it upside down\n'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown\nI'll tell ya now\nI'm so raw I still need to un-thaw\nYou feel me, yall?\nI shut the club down like Drake in the mall\nBut baby, a body like that's against the law\nYou the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw\nCold slaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all\nYou got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car\nNow get up!\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody!\nAin't nothin' but a White Trash Party!\nSo let's have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks\nIf there ain't no one but us trash\nYou dunno, you better ask somebody\nCause we're havin' a White Trash Party!\n",
