Let's go\nBetter watch out now\n'Cause here we come\nAnd we ain\u2019t stoppin'\nUntil we see the morning sun\nSo give us room to do our thing\n'Cause we ain\u2019t come to hurt no one\nSo everybody come and get up on the floor now\nAnd grab someone\n\n\nMan, first of all, I\u2019m a boss\nI just wanna get that across\nMan, even my dentist hates when I floss\nPull up to the club in a Pinto like it\u2019s a Porsche\nGarbage bag for one of the windows\nSpray painted doors\nWith the flames on \u2018em\nMichigan plates and my name's on \u2018em\nBaby, Shady\u2019s here, come and get him if you dames want him\nBut he ain\u2019t stupid\nSo quit tryna run them games on him\nHe's immune to Cupid\nWhy you tryna put your claims on him?\n'Cause you won\u2019t do to me what you did to the last man\nNow climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can\nThere\u2019s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance\nWe have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?\nShe\u2019s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man\nIn the streets of Warren, Michigan, we call \u2018em tramp stamps\nThat means she belongs to me\nTime to put the damn clamps down\nAnd show this hussy who\u2019s the man\nNow get amped, dance!\n\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party\nSo let\u2019s have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain\u2019t no one but us trash\nYou don\u2019t know, you better ask somebody\n'Cause we\u2019re having a white trash party\n\n\nPull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear\nAnd walk around the party without a care\nLike a body without a head\nLooking like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead\nAnd tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed\n'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer\nMixing Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta\nI shoot the gift like I\u2019m hollering, \"Die Santa\"\nMissed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders\nSo quit tryna play the wall like you Paul\nAnd get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stalling\nThey call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darling\n'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'\nMaking it rain for the ladies in the minis\nBut I\u2019m not throwing ones, fives, tens, or even twenties\nI\u2019m throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies\nMan, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny\u2019s\nFrom the North, East, and West\nBut when it comes to them trailers in them South parks\nMuffle it, 'cause homie that hood\u2019s tighter than Kenny\u2019s\nSo ladies, if your belly button\u2019s not an innie, then I\u2019m outtie\nNow hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy\nCome on\n\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party\nSo let\u2019s have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain\u2019t no one but us trash\nYou don\u2019t know, you better ask somebody\n'Cause we\u2019re having a white trash party\n\n\nNow whether you\u2019re black, white, or purple\nIf you\u2019re misunderstood\nBut you don\u2019t give a fuck\nYou ain\u2019t doing shit that you should\nLong as you know you\u2019re up to evil\nAnd you\u2019re no damn good\nGet on the floor, man and rep your hood\n\n\nNow honey, don\u2019t let them pricks trip\nWe should make a quick dip\nAnd go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot\n'Cause girl, I got a sick whip\nKick the back window outta my Gremlin\nPut two milk crates in the trunk\nRip out the stick shift\nAnd make a five-seater\nI\u2019ll be damned if I feed a chick\nIt ain\u2019t like me to split a piece of dry pita\nI be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y\nAnd I don\u2019t need a tank top to be a wife beater\nI\u2019ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down\n'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown\nI\u2019ll tell you now\nI\u2019m so raw, I still need to unthaw\nYou feel me y'all?\nI shut the club down like Drake in the mall\nBut baby, a body like that\u2019s against the law\nYou the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw\nColeslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all\nYou got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car\nNow get up!\n\n\nNow you can do this on your own\nBut everyone knows that no one likes to be alone\nSo get on the floor and grab somebody\nAin't nothin' but a white trash party\nSo let\u2019s have us a little bash\nAnd if anyone asks, it ain\u2019t no one but us trash\nYou don\u2019t know, you better ask somebody\n'Cause we\u2019re having a white trash party\n",
