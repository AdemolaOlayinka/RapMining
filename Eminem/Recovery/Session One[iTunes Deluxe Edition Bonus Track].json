I'm Kanye when he crashed\nIn other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas\nDestroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash\nWent through 'em and laughed\nCame back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!\nSo stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass\nSlaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian of rap\nand Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?\nSlut, answer me that, Royce where you at?\n\nI'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you\nLump on your head designed by a bar stool\nDesigned by a cartoon\nBefore I need to be hired, Jimmy Io' fire Marshall\nThe 9 tucked against the linin\nI pull it out and flip your partner upside-down like y'all are a couple 69'in\nIt's like Rick James is shootin up your house nigga!\nFUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!\nYou're screamin fuck the world with your middle finger up\nWhile I'm over here shovin my dick in a hole in the mud\nMy bitch, know I'm perfectly fit, for murder\nbecause I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel to O.J. to Glove\nI got a Posse of Insane Clowns\nBlow your brains on your opposite ear, and ask you how your brain sounds\nBad, Evil, we go Alfred, immune in mad cerebral\nYou on your last burrito!\n(What that mean Nickel?)
