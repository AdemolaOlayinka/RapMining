Critics Man\nCritics Never Got Nothin Nice To Say man\nYou know the one thing I notice about critics man?\nIs.. critics never ask me how my day went\nWell imma tell em\n\nYesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow\nSaid next time you blow up try to spit a flow\nYou wanna criticize dog try a little mo\nI'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole\nI'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro\nBetter hold on a little tighter here I go\nFlows tighter, hot headed as ghostrider\nCold hearted as spiderman throwin a spider in the snow\nSo ya better get lower than Flo-Rida inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole\nWhy am I like this? why is winter cold\nWhy is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes\nListen dog Christmas is off this is as soft as it gets\nThis isnt golf this is a blisterin' assault\nThose are your wounds this is the salt\nSo get lost\nShit dissin me is just like pissin off the wizard of oz\nWrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it\nGrab the scissors and saws and\nCut out your livers gizzards and balls\nThrow you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws\nSo sip piss like sizzurp through a straw\nThen discribe how it tasted like dessert to us all\nGot the gall to make chris piss in his draws\nTicklin him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog\n\nYou on fire\nThats how ya know your on a roll\nCause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold\nYour on fire\nMan I'm so fuckin sick I got ambulances pullin me over and shit\nYour on fire\nYa need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to get the whole hip hop shop the blow\nYour on fire.. your on fire\n\nI just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses if you mistook the for a song, look\nThis aint a song its a warnin to brooke, hogan and david cook\nThat the crook just took over so book\nRun as fast as you can, stop writin and kill it\nIm lightning in a skillet your a fuckin flash in a pan\nI pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin a fan\nMr mathers is the man\nYeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can\nCome back and whip your ass with it again\nSalivas like sufiric acid in your hand itll eat through anything metal the ass of iron man\nTurn him into plastic so for you to think that you could stand a fuckin chance is assanine\nYeah ask the nine man\nHit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines or get hit with a flying crayon\nFuck it I aint playin\nPull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man holdin a sign sayin\nVietnam vet.. I'm out my fuckin mind man\nKick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand\nSo if I seem a little mean to you this aint savage you aint never seen a brute\nYou wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route\nYou couldnt make a belemic puke on a piece of fuckin corn and peanut poop\nSayin you sick quit playin you prick dont nobody care\nThen why the fuck am I yellin at air\nI aint even talkin to noone cause aint nobody there\nNobody will fuckin test me cause these hos wont even dare\nIm wastin punchlines but I got so many to spare I just thought of another one that might go here\nNaw dont waste it save it psycho yeah\nPlus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about michaels hair\n\nYou're on fire\nThats how ya know your on a roll\nCause when you hot its like your burnin up everyone elses cold\nYour on fire\nMan I'm so hot my motherfuckin firetrucks on fire homie\nYour on fire\nYa need to stop drop and roll cause when you say the shit to give the whole hip hop shop the blow\nYour on fire.. your on fire\nYour on fire\n",
