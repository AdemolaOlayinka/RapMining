R. E.\nHe's almost famous\n\n\nNow there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin' his balls\nScreaming the wood off the panelling\nCussing the paint off the walls\nSpewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads\nHe ain't given 'em shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard\nHe'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark\nWhen it scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out \"awww!\"\nHis metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all\nIf they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off\nThey can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by\nLike David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die\nAnd eat shit while they at it\nHe's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, if pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blow it\nWho could have known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it\nAnd while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these women's been lowered\nSo bare witness to some biblical shit\nThere's a cold wind blowing\nThis world ain't gonna know what hit it\nHe did it, he made it, he's finally famous\n",
