(now)\nIt was my decision to get clean, I did it for me\nAdmittedly, I probably did it subliminally\nFor you, so I could come back a brand new me you helped see me through\nAnd don't even realize what you did, 'cause believe me you\nI been through the ringer, but they could do little to the middle finger\nI think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of\nMy world, haters can make like bees with no stingers\nAnd drop dead, no more beef lingers\nNo more drama from now on, I promise\nTo focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father\nSo I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters\nAnd raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!\nCause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club\nOr the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up\nCause I'm raising the bar\nI'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazing at stars\nI feel amazing and I'm...\n",
