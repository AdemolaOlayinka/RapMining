Tryna play games?\nSee this saw blade? See the silhouette of a stalker\nin your walk-way? Better co-operate\nOr get saut\u00e9ed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied\nMC's get so quiet you can hear a motherfucking dog whistle when I walk by\n'Colt Seavers' on a mule, stunting on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy\nI don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai\n'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids, women and men\nVrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can fit a midget in his engine\nBitch, give me them digits, why you're cringin'\nNot by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin\nWill I spend-spend even ten cents on you, since when\nDo you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?\nShit, if I think a penny's pretty\njust imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me\nEenie meenie miney mo, Catch an Eskimo by his toe (you don't own me)\nWhile he's trying to roll a snowball,\nbut don't make him lose his cool\nIf he hollers better let him go ya'll, 'cause (you don't own me)\nNow here we go go go\nGet up! Baby, get a move on, like a U-Haul\nYou can rack your brain like pool balls\nYou won't ever think of this shit\nYeah, honey you called?\nWell, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it\nEvil I see, hear and speak it\nLady, put your money on Shady\nFuck that other weak shit\nPut your eggs in the same basket\nYou can count every motherfucking chicken 'fore it hatches\n'Cause, you can bet your ass that we gon' get it crackin'\nLike the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'\nGet your brains bashed in so bad\nYou gon' have Kurt Cobain askin'\nTo autograph a bloodstained napkin\nUnfashionable and 'bout as rational\nas a rational fag's asshole\nNow let's take that line, run it up the flag pole with Elton\nSee if he's cool with it\nDon't stand there and look stupid at me, bitch\nI ain't in the mood for this shit\nGet my dick, Google it 'til it pops up\nYa'll are so motherfucking full of shit that you're stopped up\nMe, I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth\n'Til your speakers crap out \"Ohp, What?\"\nGirl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette \"Chik-Chigarette\"\nBut you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me\nSo do not strut my way, slut! Because..\nYou don't own me\nHere we go go go\nAnd now that I got your panties in a bunch\nand your bowels in an uproar\nIm'ma show you why I came\nSo you stop asking me what the fuck for\nNow look you little slut, cunt, whore I know you want more,\nbitch, it's time to put the 'Math' back in the Mathers\n'Cause I'm a fucking problem, run boy!\nEvery flow got it mastered\nSo every last word that you fucking fags heard\ncomes straight from the fish's ass, yeah\nIn other words I'm a bass-turd!\nLooking at me like I killed Kenny\nGas in the tank, yeah still plenty\nNo morals are instilled in me\nSo remorse I really don't feel any\nEat your heart out, Hannibal\nUnderstandable why you're jealous, fucking animal\nI got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now, can ya hoe?\nShady, I don't understand your flow.\nUnderstand my flow?\nBitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy.\nDon't you dare try to follow or compare, boy.\nI'm raw, you ain't even medium rare\nstay the fuck outta my hair, boy!\nYou can look, you can stare and point\nBut you can't touch -- I'm too clairvoyant.\nI don't get it man, is there a void\nAll this weak shit, what am I steroids?\nWell, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass\nand your trunk, Elephant hemorrhoids\nAnd remember boys\nYou don't own me\nNow here we go go go\nThank you for coming out\nHope you enjoyed the show\n'Til next time\nha ha\nPeace!\n",
