I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nSo what the deal ridaz?\nWould you excuse me while I feel my nuts?\nMy balls are feeling a mighty big now\nI might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches\nYeah, what the deal?\nI'm feeling hard as hell right now homie\nI almost feel... Invincible and shit\nAy Dre! You got me feeling like I can't be touched right now fool\nI'm unstoppable\nDamn\n",
