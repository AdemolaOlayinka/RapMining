I emtpy out them ?? to fight you\nIn front of every reporter that I don't like\nNo need for metaphores I get yours across when I write\nSo emotions enough to say \"fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!\"\nI might as well give this up like heavy sales\nAnd just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt\nWe can't self destruct\nI've never felt it this much\nCome on fellas, get up\nWe got to fight like Bugs last night of his life\n\n\nI walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip\nI'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith\nYour carcus is split even the beef is partially thick\nWe can't take you serious, you a comedy skit\nYou probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's\nBut the only thing you shoot is the breeze\nI can't believe you speaking on movin key's\nBut every time we hear you kick it\nThe only thing you sellin is wolf tickets\nI look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack\nSo when they bust you better bust back\nAnd get your guts clapped outa your stomach\nAnd when they want it (yeah)\nI bring a hundred niggas from runave\nSo get your gun and if you comin\n\n\nCome on an everybody come on an\nKick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an\nCause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an\nWake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin\nCause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin\nSo up an sing along with the words to the song an\nIf you don't know the words an you can't sing along an\nFake like you know em mother fuckers an join in\nEverybody come on an\n",
