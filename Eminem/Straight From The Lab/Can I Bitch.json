I miss ya!\n\n\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nWhere for art thou Can-i-bitch?\nPlease tell me what happened with\nThat style that you were rappin' with\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nAre you from Los Angeles\nNew York or just a janitor\nFrom Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch\n\nNow at first I ain't really understand the shit\nPicture me for a second and imagine it\nChillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'\nWhen all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners\nIt's Can-i-bitch on some \"Stan Lives\" shit\nIt creeped me out at first. Man this is sick\nFor me, being just a sick, this conflict\nGets my dick harder than arithmetic\nAnd I know how you jealous ones envy\nI shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me\nThe first two letters you were tellin' me shit\nLike you respect me, like any other regular MC\nThe third letter you ask how come I ain't return\nNone of the messages at Shady Records you left me\nThe fourth letter: \"Slim, you really startin' to upset me!\"\nThe fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me\nThe sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building\nThis crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me!\nSo I went back and read the first few letters that said\nSome shit about a message you left\nOh shit, that's not an \"E\" that's an \"A\"\nThis dude wants to leave me a \"massage,\" he's gay!!\nRight away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre\nWe got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way)\n\n\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nWhere for art thou Can-i-bitch?\nPlease tell me what happened with\nThat style that you were rappin' with\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nAre you from Los Angeles\nNew York or just a janitor\nFrom Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch\n\nSo in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib\nThe funny thing is we both know where this kid lives\nAnd neither one of us have Canadian citizenship\nShit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it\nAll we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost\nWe can fly over the border \"Let's go\"\nSo we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed\n(What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri\nFuck It, keep goin' no time to waste\nWait, backup hit him one more time in case\nOkay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car\nOh well, only 30 more thousand miles\nMeanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate\nJust tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate\nAnd tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine'\n\"He couldn't have fell off that hard\" Ain't no way\n\"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous\nThat Canibus turned into a television evangelist\"\nPlus he raps with his regular voice\n(What was that?) Pet Shop Boys\nSo we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted\nHis corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted\nHe kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love\nI figure if I stick him with a fork he's done\nSo I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ\nHe won't die, this guy's like a battered wife\nHe's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more\nBut he won't fight back I cracked his jaw\nHold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up!\nPunch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch!\nDo somethin'! At least one punchline\nC'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-\nty-nine percent of my fans are blonde\n'Bis c'mon answer me man respond!\nTell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars\nIntergalatical metaphors from Mars!\nRaw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs\nBite another line from Redman's song!\nSuddenly the stub from a dead man's arm\nFrom a midget reaches out from under the car\nIt's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither\nDre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether\nWe stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again\n(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again!\nStomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!)\nDre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him!\nI think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)\nHe disappeared yo he's gone he did it again\n\n\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nWhere for art thou Can-i-bitch?\nPlease tell me what happened with\nThat style that you were rappin' with\nCan-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch\nAre you from Los Angeles\nNew York or just a janitor\nFrom Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch\n",
