 Hey Em, what's up?
 Steve Berman. What's goin' on, man, how you doin'? 
Good to see you again. What's up?
 Em, could you come in here and have a seat, please?
 Umm, yeah, what's...
 Vanessa? Shut the door
 Okay 
 So what's up? How's orders looking for the first week?
 It would be better if you gave me nothing at all
 Wh...
 This album is less than nothing. I can't sell this fucking record
 Wha...
 Do you know what's happening to me out there?
 Wh-wha-what's the problem?
 Violent Ground told me to go fuck myself!
 Who's Violent...?
 Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass! 
Do you know what it feels like 
to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
 But, I...
 I'm gonna lose my fuckin' job over this 
You know why Dre's record was so successful? 
He's rappin' about big-screen T.V.s, blunts, 40's and bitches. 
You're rappin' about homosexuals and Vicadin
 I mean-
 I can't sell this shit!
 What...
 Either change the record or it's not coming out!
 What, I...
 Now get the fuck out of my office!
 What am I supposed...
 NOW!
 Alright man....
