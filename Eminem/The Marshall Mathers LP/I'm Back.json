I'm Back\n\nI murder a rhyme one word at a time\nYou never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine\nYou better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help\nWhat good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?\nI'm waitin for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell\nManson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail\nI used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve\nThirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf\nI used to, get punked and bullied on my block\n'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox\n(\"Mom! MOM!\") I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less\nWhat do I think of suc-cess? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed\nToo much stares two breasts, too upset\nIt's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)\nGrew up quick (no) was raised right\nWhatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right\nYou think of my name now whenever you say, \"Hi\"\nBecame a commodity because I'm W-H-I-\n-T-E, cuz MTV was so friendly to me\nCan't wait 'til Kim sees me\nNow is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?\nRead my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't workin?\nYou hear this finger? Oh it's upside down\nHere, let me turn this motherfucker up right now\n\n\nI take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it\njust to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music\nAnd if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim\nand becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe\nMy name is Slim Shady\nI been crazy way before radio didn't play me\nThe sensational\nWith Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible\nIt's Ken Kaniff on the, internet\nTryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed\nIt's a, sick world we live in these days\n\"Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!\"\nGeez, you guys are so sensitive\n\"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it\"\nMind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic\nwhose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em\nwith my windows tinted, with nine limos rented\nDoin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin out\nall high and indo scented (inhales, exhales)\nAnd that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me\n\n\nI take seven (kids) from (Columbine), stand 'em all in line\nAdd an AK-47, a revolver, a nine\na Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine\nand that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time\nCause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy\nas the world was over this whole Y2K thing\nAnd by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?\nAm I the only one who realizes they stink?\nShould I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?\nLip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?\nIt's why I tend to block out when I hear things\nCause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)\nSo I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger\nlonger than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina\nCause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz\nit'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!\nI'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother\nI still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her\nand have a son and a new brother at the same time\nand just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?\n\n\nGuess who's b-back, back\nGue-gue-guess who's back (Hi mom!)\nGuess who's back\nGue guess who's back\nD-12 Guess who's back\nGue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back\nDr. Dre Guess who's back\nBack back back\nSlim Shady, 2001\nI'm blew out from this blunt (sighs) fuck\n",
