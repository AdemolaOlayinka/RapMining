I ain't coming in yet...\nI'll come in a minute\nAyo...This is my love song...it goes like this\n\nBack when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark\nThis is how we used to make the party start\nWe used to mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark\nAnd when it, kicks in you can hardly talk\nAnd by the, sixth gin you're gonna probably crawl\nAnd you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf\nAnd my pre-diction is you're gonna probably fall\nEither somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall\nAnd everything's spinning\nYou're beginin' to think women\nare swimming in pink linen again in the sink\nThen in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished\nYou are now allowed to officially slap bitches\nYou have the right to remain violent and start wilin'\nStart a fight with the same guy that was smart eyin' you\nGet in your car, start it, and start drivin'\nOver the island and cause a 42 car pile-up\nEarth calling, pilot to co-pilot\nLooking at the life on this planet, sir, no sign of it\nAll I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'\nAnd I'm so high that I might die if I go by it\nLet me out of this place\nI'm outta place\nI'm in outer space\nI've just vanished without a trace\nI'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow\nI'll be back in an hour or so\n\n\n'Cause every time I go to try to leave\nSomeone keeps pullin' on my sleeve\nI don't wanna, but I gotta stay\nThese drugs really got a hold of me\n'Cause every time I try to tell them \"no\"\nThey won't let me ever let them go\nI'm a sucker all I gotta say\nThese drugs really got a hold of me\n\nIn third grade, all I used to do\nWas sniff glue through a tube and play Rubic's cube\n17 years later I'm as Rude as Jude\nScheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs\nI've got no game\nAnd every face looks the same\nThey've got no name\nSo I don't need game to play\nI just say whatever I want to whoever I want\nWhenever I want, wherever I want, however I want\nHowever, I do show some respect to few\nAs ecstasy got me standing next to you\nGetting sentimental as fuck spillin' guts to you\nWe just met\nBut I think I'm in love with you\nBut you're on it too\nSo you tell me you love me too\nWake up in the morning like \"yo, what the fuck we do?\"\nI gotta go bitch\nYou know I have stuff to do\n'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you\nBut in the long run\nThese drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later\nBut fuck it, I'm on one\nSo let's enjoy\nLet the X destroy your spinal cord\nSo it's not a straight line no more\n'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls\nShit's sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur\nShit, six hits won't even get me high no more\nSo bye for now\nI'm going to try to find some more\n\n\nThat's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow\nWhen you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow\nAnd tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again\nWhat's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it\nAnd what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?\nAnd what's a little fight?\nTomorrow you'll be boys again\nIt's your life\nLive it however you wanna\nMarijuana is everywhere\nWhere was you brought up?\nIt don't matter as long as you get where you're going\n'Cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going\nThey tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignoring\nEven though you wake up feeling like shit every morning\nBut you're young\nYou've got a lot of drugs to do\nGirls to screw\nParties to crash\nSucks to be you\nIf I could take it all back now, I wouldn't\nI would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't\nBut I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated\nDid better drugs and updated\nBut I've still got a lot of growing up to do\nI've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew\nBut when it's all said and done I'll be 40\nBefore I know it with a 40 on the porch telling stories\nWith a bottle of Jack\nTwo grandkids in my lap\nBabysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed\n\n\nDrugs really got a hold of me\nThey really got a hold of me\n'Cause drugs really got a hold of me\nThey really got a hold of me\n",
