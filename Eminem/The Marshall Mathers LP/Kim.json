That's fine!\nBut not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?\nThis couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!\nHow could you let him sleep in our bed?\nLook at Kim\nLook at your husband now!\n(No!)\nI said look at him!\nHe ain't so hot now is he?\nLittle punk!\n(Why are you doing this?)\nShut the fuck up!\n(You're drunk! You're never going to get away at this!)\nYou think I give a fuck!\nCome on we're going for a ride, bitch\n(No!)\nSit up front\n(Well, I can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)\nWe'll be right back\nWell, I will, you'll be in the trunk\n\nSo long, bitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\nYou really fucked me Kim\nYou really did a number on me\nNever knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me\nBut we was kids then Kim, I was only 18\nThat was years ago\nI thought we wiped the slate clean\nThat's fucked up!\n(I love you!)\nOh, God, my brain is racing\n(I love you!)\nWhat are you doing?\nChange the station I hate this song!\nDoes this look like a big joke?\n(No!)\nThere's a four year old boy lyin' dead with a slit throat\nIn your living room, ha-ha\nWhat you think I'm kiddin' you?\nYou loved him, didn't you?\n(No!)\nBullshit you, bitch, don't fucking lie to me\nWhat the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?\nFuck you asshole, yeah, bite me\nKim, KIM!\nWhy don't you like me?\nYou think I'm ugly don't you\n(It's not that!)\nNo, you think I'm ugly\n(Baby)\nGet the fuck away from me, don't touch me\nI HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!\nI SWEAR TO GOD, I HATE YOU\nOH, MY GOD, I LOVE YOU\nHow the fuck could you do this to me?\n(Sorry!)\nHow the fuck could you do this to me?\n\nSo long, bitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\nCome on get out\n(I can't I'm scared)\nI said get out, bitch!\n(Let go of my hair, please don't do this, baby)\n(Please I love you, look we can just take Hailie and leave)\nFuck you, you did this to us\nYou did it, it's your fault\nOh, my God, I'm crackin' up\nGet a grip Marshall\nHey remember the time we went to Brian's party?\nAnd you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie\nThat was funny, wasn't it?\n(Yes!)\nThat was funny, wasn't it?\n(Yes!)\nSee it all makes sense, doesn't it?\nYou and your husband have a fight\nOne of you tries to grab a knife\nAnd during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced\n(No!)\nAnd while this is goin' on\nHis son just woke up and he just walks in\nShe panics and he gets his throat cut\n(Oh, my God!)\nSo now they both dead and you slash your own throat\nSo now it's double homicide and suicide with no note\nI should have known better when you started to act weird\nWe could've... HEY! Where you going? Get back here!\nYou can't run from me, Kim\nIt's just us, nobody else!\nYou're only making this harder on yourself\nHa! Ha! Got'cha!\n(Ah!)\nHa! Go ahead, yell!\nHere I'll scream with you!\nAH, SOMEBODY HELP!\nDon't you get it, bitch, no one can hear you?\nNow shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you\nYou were supposed to love me\nNOW BLEED! BITCH, BLEED!\nBLEED! BITCH, BLEED! BLEED!\n\nSo long, bitch, you did me so wrong\nI don't wanna go on\nLiving in this world without you\n",
