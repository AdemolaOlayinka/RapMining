They didn't do it again,\nwhat-what, what-what?\nDid you shit on these niggaz two times Dr. Dre?\nOh fo' sho'!\nUh-uh, naw, ya smell that?\nThis is special right here\nWhat-what, what-what-what?\nYeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby\nUhh, to the boogie-oogie-oogie\nYeah, y'know! What's crackin Dre?\n\nJust let me lay back and kick some mo' simplistic pimp shit\non Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit)\nThrow on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts\nand watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious\n(Watch out now!) Some of these crowds that Slim draws\nis rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard when it's packed and fulla cars\nSome of these crowds me and Snoop draw +IS+ niggaz from Crenshaw\nfrom Long Beach to South Central\nWhoa, not these niggaz again\nThese grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again\n(Hehe) You and what army could harm me?\nD-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach\n(East-syde!) Came a long way, to makin these songs play\nIt'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way\nI got a long uz', and I carry it all day\n(Blaow!) Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just bein Andre,\nbut I..\n\nsomehow, someway - tell 'em, nigga\nYou know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)\nNow let me cut these niggaz up and show em where da fuck I'm comin from\nI get the party crackin from the shit that I be spittin son\nHit-and-run, get it done, get the funds, split and run\nGot about fifty guns, and I love all of 'em the same - bang bang!\nDamn baby girl what's your name?\nI forgot - what'd you say it was? Damn a nigga buzzed\nHangin in the club, with my nephew Eminem\n(Whassup Slim?) Whattup cuz? (Whattup Snoop?)\nThe Great White American Hope, done hooked up\nwith the King of the motherfuckin West coast, bay-bayy!\n\nAnd you don't really wanna fuck, with me\nOnly nigga that I trust, is me\nFuck around and make me bust, this heat\nThat's, the devil, they always wanna dance\n\nI'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin you move\nYou're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage\nGotta love it, cause I expose the facade\nYour little lungs is too small to hotbox with God\nAll jokes aside, come bounce with us\nStandin over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust\nIt's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust\nI might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs\nSo who do you trust? They just not rugged enough\nWhen things get rough I'm in the club shootin with Puff\nBitch, please - you must have a mental disease\nAssume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon\n\n\nAwww naww, big Slim Dogg\nEighty pound balls, dick six inch long\nBack up, in the, heezy BAY-BAY\nHe's Sha-day!\n\nHe's so cra-zay!\n\nHahaha! Gimme the mic, let me recite, 'til Timothy White\npickets outside the Interscope offices every night\nWhat if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin a living\noff of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right\nto say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird\nLivin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs\nDreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave\nRun away from home and grow to be as evil as me\nI just want you all to notice me and people to see\nthat somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me\nIt just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me\nis cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean\nSo when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on TV\nor heard the CD usin the fag word so freely\nit's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?\nSuck my fuckin dick, you faggot\nYou happy now? Look here\n\nI start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)\nAsk the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know)\nI start some shit they throw me out the back do' (the back do')\nCome back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo' (a fo'-fo')\n\n\n2001 and forever\nSlim Shady, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, X to the Z, Nate Dogg\nC'mon, yeah!!\n",
