Gimme back my sixteen dollars\nAll I see is sissies in magazines smiling\nWhatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?\nWhatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned\npassionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?\nNew Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick\nBoy/girl groups make me sick\nAnd I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public\nI'ma love it.. (hahaha)\nVanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)\nSaid some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)\nThen went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)\nA bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me\nand run around screamin, \"I don't care, just bite me\" (nah nah)\nI think I was put here to annoy the world\nand destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl\nPlus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer\nand call themselves \"Clowns\" cause they look queer\nFaggot2Dope and Silent Gay\nClaimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)\nAnd I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out\nAsk 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out\nafter they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out\n(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!\nLook at y'all runnin your mouth again\nwhen you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10\nAnd I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females\nin make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails\n\"Slim Anus,\" you damn right, Slim Anus\nI don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!\n\nCause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)\nI'm not a wrestler guy,\nI'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)\nCome and see me on the streets alone\nif you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)\nAnd if you wanna run your mouth\nthen come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)\n\nIs it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?\nYou little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy\nNow because of this blonde mop that's on top\nand this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?\nThe underground just spunned around and did a 360\nNow these kids diss me and act like some big sissies\n\"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,\nso now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy\"\nMy fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million\nShe must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin\nShit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?\nAll I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress\nWhich is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?\nIt doesn't matter your faggot!\nTalkin about I fabricated my past\nHe's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)\nSo tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?\nFor every million I make, another relative sues\nFamily fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper\nAll the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)\nA half-brother and sister who never seen me\nor even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV\nNow everybody's so happy and proud\nI'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house\nHey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand\nto buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp\nSkipped to the last page, flipped right fast\nand what do I see? A picture of my big white ass\nOkay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:\nuhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL\nNow your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell\nAhh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself\n",
