Man how's your daughter?\nMy girlfriend's pregnant, too, I'm bout to be a father\nIf I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?\nI'ma name her Bonnie\nI read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry\nI had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him\nI know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan\nI even got the underground shit that you did with Skam\nI got a room full of your posters and your pictures man\nI like the shit you did with Rawkus, too, that shit was phat\nAnyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,\njust to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan\nThis is Stan\n\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\nDear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance\nI ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans\nIf you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert\nyou didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew\nThat's my little brother man, he's only six years old\nWe waited in the blistering cold for you,\nfour hours and you just said, \"No.\"\nThat's pretty shitty man - you're like his fucking idol\nHe wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do\nI ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to\nRemember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you\nyou would write back - see I'm just like you in a way\nI never knew my father neither;\nhe used to always cheat on my mom and beat her\nI can relate to what you're saying in your songs\nso when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on\n'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed\nI even got a tattoo with your name across the chest\nSometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds\nIt's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me\nSee everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it\nMy girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7\nBut she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does\nShe don't know what it was like for people like us growing up\nYou gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose\nSincerely yours, Stan\n-- P.S.\nWe should be together, too\n\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\nDear Mister I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,\nthis'll be the last package I ever send your ass\nIt's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?\nI know you got my last two letters;\nI wrote the addresses on 'em perfect\nSo this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it\nI'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway\nHey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?\nYou know the song by Phil Collins, \"In the Air Tonight\"\nabout that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning\nbut didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?\nThat's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning\nNow it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy\nand all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call\nI hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall\nI love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it\nYou ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it\nAnd when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it\nI hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me\nSee Slim; Shut up bitch! I'm trying to talk!\nHey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk,\nBut I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you\n'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die, too\nWell, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now\nOh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?\n\n.. ..\n\nMy tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all\nThe morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all\nAnd even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall\nIt reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\n\nDear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I've just been busy\nYou said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?\nLook, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that\nand here's an autograph for your brother,\nI wrote it on the Starter cap\nI'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you\nDon't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you\nBut what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too?\nI say that shit just clowning dogg,\nc'mon - how fucked up is you?\nYou got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling\nto help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\nor maybe you just need to treat her better\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\nbefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine\nif you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan\nwhy are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\nand had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\nand in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\nCome to think about it, his name was... it was you\nDamn!\n",
