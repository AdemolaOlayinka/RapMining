(What up?)\nI gotta question if I may? (Yeah)\nIs it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)\nAnd watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)\nBut, up I ain't done yet\nIn football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt\nWhile he reaches in another grown man's ass\nGrabs on his nuts but just what if\nIt was never meant it was just an accident\nBut he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in\nHis teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it\nBut his little weenie flinched just a little bit\nAnd I don't mean to go in into any more details but\nWhat if he pictured it as a females butt?\nIs that gay? I just need to clear things up\n'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...\n\nYou find me offensive, I find you offensive\nShit, this is the same verse I just did this\nWhen am I gonna come to my good senses?\nProbably the day Bush comes to my defenses\nMy spider sense is telling me Spiderman is nearby\nAnd my plan is to get him next\nAnd open up a whip-ass canister\nGoddamn it Dre where's the god damn beat? (Yeah)\nAnyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it\nThis is the only thing that I'm good at\nI am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic\nDemonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it\nI got it, high five Nick Lachey\nStuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away\nAnd as she flew around the room like a balloon\nI grabbed the last can of chicken tuna\nOut the trash can and zoom\nI headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch\nWith a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich\nAnd I ain't even gotta make no god damn sense\nI just did a whole song and I didn't say shit\n\nCause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH\nYo, Rain Man\nDefinitely, definitely Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and\nTwo thousand four hundred and eighty seven million\nNine hundred and seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three\nAnd seventy (Yeah)\n",
