Well I guess that I'm between predominantly\nBoth of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream\nWhile I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?\nDo you think that I'm kidding? What do I look like some kind of idi-\nWait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?\nWhy do I go through so much bullshit, it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch\nWoe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions\nAnd his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in\nFrom the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad\nAnd how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it\nMan I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it\nI can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard\nNeeds to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it\nMan if I only had half of it\nShit, if you only knew the half of it\n\n\nEvil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds\nPlease release me from these demons\nI never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe\nI don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry\nNow look at all the pain I caused\nDear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?\nWhat did I do that was so bad to deserve this?\nEverything could have been so perfect\nBut life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoisted up in the air\nForty feet below me, there's people everywhere\nI don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel\nAnd all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel\nWithout this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round\nHere we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go\nNow ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now\nBut the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be\nWhere's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be\nSo please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on\n'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone\n",
