(I swear!)\nAnd I was on my way there\nBelieve me I'm leaving a carcass today\nAnd I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way\nI'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked\nI'm gonna meet you at the club we're gonna fuck these hoes up\n\n\nI've never seen no shit like this in my life before\nPeople are still camped out from the night before\nSleeping outside the door waiting in line\nStill tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform\nThe fire marshals know the venue's too small\nPeople are wall to wall three thousand and some odd fans\nAnd some cum wad from out the parking lot\nGets in an argument over a parking spot\nDecides to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off\nMissed who he's aiming for six feet away's the door\nInto the same entrance hall now the strays flying all over the place\nGrazed one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the wall\nBefore anyone could even hear the first shot go off\nI'm posted up by the bar having a Mazel Tov\nBullet whizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off\nThank god I'm alive I gotta find a nine\nAnd where the fuck is Von he usually tucks one on him\nWait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre\nNah I guess not, what the fuck oh my god it was\nI never saw him run so fast in my life\nLook at him hauling ass I think he left his wife\nThere she is on the ground being trampled\nI go to grab her up by the damn hand but I can't pull her\nGod damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit\nMy vest is barely able to handle it, it's too thin\nIf I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop Dee\nFollow Bizarre's path and ran through it\nMade it to the front door and collapsed on the steps\nLooked up and I seen Swift shooting it out\nBut I can't see who he's shooting it out with\nBut Denaun's right behind him squeezing his four fifth\n\n\nIt's Friday night came to this bitch right\nBig ass in my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right\nI ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to fight\nAlthough I can't stay here to fight 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight\nThat's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge\nShot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in\nSwift told me to meet him here so it's clear that this fucker\nShoot out the back of his truck goes up in this motherfucker\nSo one shot for the money two's to stop the show\nThird's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go\n(I just wanna know who's driving a black Mitsubishi)\nHe tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee with a three piece\n",
