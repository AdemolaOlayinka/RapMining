(Yeah)\nNow, what's your name girl?\nWhat's your sign?\n\"Man, you must be up out your mind\"\nDRE! (AH-AH)\nBeer Goggles! Blind!\nI'm just tryna unwind now I'm\n\nNow I'm gonna make you dance\nIt's your chance\nYeah boy shake that ass\nOops I mean girl,\nGirl, girl, girl,\nGirl you know you're my world\nAlright now lose it\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nJust lose it\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nGo crazy\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nOh baby\n(AH-AH)\nOh baby, baby\n(AH-AH)\n\nIt's Tuesday and I'm locked up\nI'm in jail and I don't know what happened\nThey say I was running butt naked\nDown the street screaming\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nWell I'm sorry, I don't remember\nAll I know is this much\nI'm not guilty\nThey said, \"Save it, boy we gotcha you on tape\nyellin' at an old lady to 'Touch my body!'\"\nNow this is the part where the rap breaks down\nIt gets real intense, no one makes a sound\nEverything looks like it's 8 Mile now\nThe beat comes back and everybody lose themselves\nSnap back to reality\nLook it's B.Rabbit!\nYo you signed me up to battle!?\nI'm a grown man!\nChubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie\nI don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!\nFella's (WHAT?!) Fella's (WHAT?!)\nGrab you left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)\nBlack girls\nWhite girls\nSkinny girls\nFat girls\nTall girls\nSmall girls\nI'm callin' all girls\nEveryone report to the dance floor\nIt's your chance for a little romance or\nButt squeezin' it's the season\nJust go (AH-AH-AH-AH)\nIt's so appeasin'\n\nNow I'm gonna make you dance\nIt's your chance\nYeah boy shake that ass\nOops I mean girl,\nGirl, girl, girl,\nGirl you know you're my world\nAlright now lose it\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nJust lose it\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nGo crazy\n(AH-AH-AH-AH-AH)\nOh baby\n(AH-AH)\nOh baby, baby\n(AH-AH)\n\nUmMmMmm touch my body\nUmMmMmm touch my body\nOoh boy just touch my body\nI mean girl just touch my body\n",
