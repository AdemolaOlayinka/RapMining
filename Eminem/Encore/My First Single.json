I don't know\nTryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off\nBut I know anything's possible\nThough I'm not gonna top what I sold\nI'm at the top of my game\nThat shit is not gonna change\nLong as I got Dr. Dre on my team\nI'll get away with murder\nI'm like O.J. he's like my Cochran today\nWe keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes\nIn a safe, locked them away\nBetter watch what you say\nJust when you thought you were safe\nThem fuckers got you on tape\nYou swear to god you was playing\nWhether or not you was little Joshua\nGosh I wish I could've told you to not do the same\nCause one day it could cost you your name\n\n\nAnd this was supposed to be my first single\nBut I just fucked that up so,\nFuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Oh Ah Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nPoo Poo Ca Ca\n\n\nErra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills\nAnd woke up in bed next to his best friend Derick bare naked\nchicka chicka chicka ..\nJanean just turned 16 and used a fake id\nTo sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly\nHehehehehe, to be so young and naive\nOh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free\nParis and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish\nEvery picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks\nHickory Dickory Dirk Diggler\nLook at me work wizardry with these words\nAm I a jerk or just jerk chicken\nOr Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain\n22 jerks and a jerk circle\nOr is it a circle jerk or wait a minute\nWhat am I saying, allow me to run it back and rewind it\nrrrbb lemme ask you again\nAm I just jerkin the chain\nAm I bizerk or insane\nOr am I just one of them damn amateurs\nWorking the damn camera filming one of them\nParis Hilton home made pornos\nWho keeps tilting the lens at an angle\nChicka Chicka\nJust recently somebody just discovered\nBritney and Justin videotapes of them fucking\nWhen they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse club\nAnd dusted them and went straight to The Source with them\nCause they could've sworn someone said Nuh-\nAnd then tried to erase and record over it\nBut if you listen close enough to it you can hear the\nGa-Uh and then the come to find out it was Justin\nSaying \"I'm gonna come!\"\nAnd this was suppose to be\n\n\nsupposed to be my first single\nBut I just fucked that up so,\nFuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Oh Ah Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nPoo Poo Ca Ca\n\n\nAny opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest\nAnd address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it\nAll you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number\nIt's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick\nAnd if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me\nJust type in your number back and follow it by the pound key\nAnd I'll be sure to get back\nAs soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre\nWake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)\nSo fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken,\nBeat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock(?) bawka-bi-kaw\nOr suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick\nAnd stick a dick in your mouth\nI'm done you can fuck off\nfucka-fucka-fuck off!\n\n\nAnd this was supposed to be my first single\nBut I just fucked that up so,\nFuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle\nSlap a bitch and smack a ho\nThis was supposed to be my catchy little jingle\nThat you hear on your radio\nBut shit's about to hit the shingle\nOh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh No\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Ah\nerra Oh Oh Ah Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nOh Ah Oh Ah\nPoo Poo Ca Ca\n",
