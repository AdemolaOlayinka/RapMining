    "lyrics": "I don't know why this world keep turning\nRound and Round\nBut I wish it would stop, and let me off right now\nYes man\nAs the World Turns\nWe all experience things in life\nTrials and Tribulations\nThat we all must go through\nWhen someone wants to test us\nWhen someone tries our patience\n\nI hang with a bunch of hippies\nand wacky tobacco planters\nWho swallow lit roaches\nand light up like jack-o-lanterns\nOutsiders baby, and we suing the courts\nCause we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source\nThey never should've booted me out of reform school\nDeformed fool,taking a shit in a warm pool\nThey threw me out the Ramada Inn\nI said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)\nIt all started when my mother took my bike away\nCause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave\nAfter that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers\nSlappin teachers, and jacking off in front of my counselors\nClass clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman\nFuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessing\nAnd all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,\nHe'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed\nMay be true, till I told this bitch in gym class\nThat she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)\nYeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig\nShe picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig\nPut me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig\nI felt the evilness and started transforming (RARRRR!)\nIt began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming\nGrabbed that bitch by her hair\nDrag her across the ground\nAnd took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down\nSorry coach, its too late to tell me stop\nWhile I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop\n\nAs the World Turns\nThese are the days of our lives\nThese are the things that we must go through\nDay by day\n\nWe drive around in million dollar sports cars\nWhile little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards\nOutsiders, and we suing the courts\nCause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source\nHypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat\nWhere all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at\nDressed like a sailor, standing by a pale of garbage\nIts almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch\nI met a slut and said \"What up, its nice to meet ya\"\nI'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza\nBut I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month\nBut if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt\nBut I ain't got no weed, no phillies, or no papers\nPlus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist\nSo gimme all your money\nAnd don't try nothing funny\nCause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me\nI went to grab my gun\nThat's when her ass put it on me\nWit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry\nI fell through the glass doors\nStarted causing a scene\nThen slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine\nJumped up with a broken back\nThank god I was smocking crack all day\nAnd doped up off coke and smack\nAll I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse\nNow I wanna kill her\nBut so I gotta catch her first\nRan through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut\nSaw the house she ran up in\nAnd shot her fucking porch up\nKicked the door down to murder this divorced slut\nLooked around the room\nThat's when I seen the bedroom door shut\nI know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!\nYou might as well come out now\nShe said \"Come in, its unlocked!\"\nI walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne\nAnd seen her spread across the bed naked watching gay porn\nShe said \"Come her big boy, lets get acquainted\"\nI turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it\nShe came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her\nI shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her\nI started to beg \"No, please let go\"\nBut she swallowed my fucking leg whole like an egg roll\nWith one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled\nI grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple\nJust trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick\nDen Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!\nWhipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it\nIt hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage\nI shouted \"Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!\"\nStuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ah!! Ah!)\nCome here bitch!\nCome here!\nTake this motherfucking dick!\nBitch, come here!\n\nAnd as we go along\nThroughout the days of our lives\nWe all face small obstacles and challenges everyday\nThat we must go through\nThese are the things that surround us through our atmosphere\nEvery day\nEvery single day the world keeps turning\n",
