    "lyrics": "Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.\nFed up with life and the way things are going,\nhe decides to rob a liquor store.\n(\"I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes\")\nBut on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.\nAnd suddenly, his conscience comes into play...\n(\"Shit is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this\")\n\nAlright, stop! (Huh?)\nNow before you walk in the door of this liquor store\nand try to get money out the drawer\nYou better think of the consequence (But who are you?)\nI'm your motherfuckin conscience\n\nThat's nonsense!\nGo in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs\nAnd borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs\nTell her you need a place to stay\nYou'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Renee's razor blade\n\nYeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to\nThe whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you\nThink about it before you walk in the door first\nLook at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns\n\nFuck that! Do that shit! Shoot that bitch!\nCan you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?\nWhy you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?\nDo you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?\n\nMan, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)\nNot over this shit (Stop!) Drop the biscuit (I will!)\nDon't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you\n(You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude..)\n\n(\"It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute\")\n(\"Mmm, I don't know!\")\n(\"Look baby..\")\n(\"Damn!\")\n(\"Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?\")\n(\"Well OK..\")\n\nMeet Stan, twenty-one years old. (\"Give me a kiss!\")\nAfter meeting a young girl at a rave party,\nthings start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.\nOnce again, his conscience comes into play... (\"Shit!\")\n\nNow listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek\nand smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink\nNow all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe..\n(Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old\nYou shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)\nYo, look at her bush.. does it got hair? (Uh huh!)\nFuck this bitch right here on the spot bare\nTil she passes out and she forgot how she got there\n(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _Kids_?)\nNo, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!\n(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)\nMan fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail..\n\n\nMeet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.\nAfter coming home from a hard day's work,\nhe walks in the door of his trailer park home\nto find his wife in bed with another man.\n(\"WHAT THE FUCK?!?!\")\n(\"Grady!!\")\n\nAlright calm down, relax, start breathin..\n\nFuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin\nWhile you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!\nFUCK slittin her throat, CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF!!!\n\nWait! What if there's an explanation for this shit?\n(What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)\nAlright Shady, maybe he's right Grady\nBut think about the baby before you get all crazy\n\nOkay! Thought about it, still wanna stab her?\nGrab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?\nThat's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard\nYou gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!\n\nWhat'chu say? (What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?)\nI'ma kill you motherfucker!\n\nUhhh-aahh! Temper temper!\nMr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?\nMr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?\nHow in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\n\nCause he don't need to go the same route that I went\nBeen there, done that.. aw fuck it...\nWhat am I sayin? Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?\n",
