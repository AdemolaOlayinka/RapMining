    "lyrics": "A-yo!\nThis song is dedicated to all the happy people\nAll the happy people who have real nice lives\nAnd have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck\n\nI feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net\nI'm popping percocets, I'm a nervous wreck\nI deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check\n'Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt\nMinimum wage got my adrenaline caged\nFull of venom and rage\nEspecially when I'm engaged\nAnd my daughter's down to her last diaper\nThat's got my ass hyper\nI pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer\nWatching ballers while they're flossing in their pathfinders\nThese overnight stars becoming autograph signers\nWe all long to blow up and leave the past behind us\nAlong with the small fry's and average half pinters\nWhile player haters turn bitch like they have vaginas\n'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us\nMoney'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless\nWhile snakes slither in the grass spineless\n\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen this life makes you're mad enough to kill\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen you want something bad enough to steal\nThat's Rock Bottom\nWhen you feel like you've had it up to here\n'Cause you're mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear\n\nMy life is full of empty promises\nAnd broken dreams\nI'm hoping things will look up\nBut there ain't no job openings\nI feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished\nLiving in this house with no furnace, unfurnished\nAnd I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay\nAnd I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day\nBut fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play\n'Cause when we die we know we're all going the same way\nIt's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan\nWhen all you need is bucks to be the man\nPlus a luxury sedan\nToo comfortable and roomy in a six\nBut they threw me in the mix\nWith all these gloomy lunatics\nWho walk around depressed\nAnd smoke a pound of ses a day\nAnd yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today\nMy daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play\nLive half my life and throw the rest away\n\nThere's people that love me and people that hate me (yup)\nBut it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady\nI want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame\nThat means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames\nThat means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name\nThere's lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain\n'Cause right now I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom\nI got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em (I'm done)\nI'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em\nHolding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em\nMy daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em\nAnd the rings you're wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em\nAnd while you flaunt 'em I could be taking them to shops to pawn them\nI got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?\n'Cause I never went gold off one song\nI'm running up on someone's lawn with guns drawn\n",
