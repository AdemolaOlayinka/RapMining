Oh my God!\nWe're gonna have to shock him!\nOh my God!\n\nThese are the results of a thousand electric volts\nA neck with bolts, \"Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!\"\nA kid who refused to respect adults\nWore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose\nA corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery\nCause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me\nAnd I might snap, one day just like that\nI decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack\n(Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid said,\n\"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die\"\nI looked at my watch it was one twenty\n\"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?\"\nHe said, \"Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse...\"\nMy palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first\nSomething told me, \"Try to fake a stomach ache it works\"\nI screamed, \"Owww! My appendix feels like they could burst!\nTeacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!\"\n\"What's the matter?\"\n\"I don't know, my leg, it hurts!\"\n\"Leg?!? I thought you said it was your tummy?!?\"\n\"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!\"\n\"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.\nAnd just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework.\"\n\"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?\"\n\"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him.\"\n\nBrain damage, ever since the day I was born\nDrugs is what they used to say I was on\nThey say I never knew which way I was goin\nBut everywhere I go they keep playin my song\n\nBrain damage..\nWay before my baby daughter Hailey\nI was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey\nAn eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes\nso everyday he'd shove me in the lockers\nOne day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin\nAnd had me in the position to beat me into submission\nHe banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,\nSoaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat\nI tried to plead and tell him, \"We shouldn't beef\"\nBut he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe\nHe looked at me and said, \"You gonna die honkey!\"\nThe principal walked in (What's going on in here?)\nand started helpin him stomp me\nI made them think they beat me to death\nHoldin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left\nThen I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth\nKicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws\nGrabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools\n\"This is for every time you took my orange juice,\nor stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.\nEvery time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.\nI'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good.\"\nI cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could\nand beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood\nKnocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..\n.. Made it home, later that same day\nStarted reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray\nI couldn't even see what I was tryin to read\nI went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed\nMy mother started screamin, \"What are you on, drugs?!?\nLook at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!\" (Sorry!)\nShe beat me over the head with the remote control\nopened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull\nI picked it up and screamed, \"Look bitch, what have you done?!?\"\n\"Oh my God, I'm sorry son\"\n\"Shut up you cunt!\" I said, \"Fuck it!\"\nTook it and stuck it back up in my head\nthen I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck\n\n\nBrain damage..\nIt's brain damage..\nI got brain damage..\nIt's brain damage..\nIt's probably brain damage..\nIt's brain damage..\nBrain damage..\nI got brain damage..\n",
