Outsidaz)\nThis is my dance song (Outsidaz)\nCan you hear me?\n(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)\nAight, ay turn my headphones up\n(bust it bust it)\n\nMy favoite color is red, like the blood shed\nfrom Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead\nWomen all grabbin at my shishkabob\nBought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve\n(I can't stand white people!)\nYou thought I was livid, now I'm even more so\nShit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat\nI got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}\nI'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show\n(Yo can you sign this right here?)\nI just remembered that I'm absent minded\nWait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it\nI'm freestylin every verse that I spit\ncause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)\nI told the doc I need a change in sickness\nand gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis\nPut my LP on your Christmas gift list\nYou wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this\nCum on everybody -- get down tonight\n\nYo.. yo yo yo yo\nI tried suicide once and I'll try it again\nThat's why I write songs where I die at the end\nCause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck\nand I was wavin it at everybody screamin, \"I suck\" (I SUCK!!!)\nI go on stage in front of a sellout crowd\nand yell out loud, \"All y'all get the hell out now\"\nFuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry\n(But Eminem this is your record release party!)\nI'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer\nand nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford\nGuess I'm just a sick sick bastard\nwho's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)\nOne Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet\nI feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage\n(ohhhhhhh) And if you ever see a video for this shit\nI'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit\nCum on everybody -- get down tonight\n\nGot bitches on my jock out in East Detroit\nCause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}\nSo I told em I was Mike D\nThey was like, \"Gee I don't know, he might be!\"\nI told em, \"Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert\nI'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)\"\nThen I jetted to the weed house\nSmoked out til I started bustin freestyles\nBroke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick\nCrushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}\nMade a couple of crank calls collect\n\"Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?\"\nI wanna make songs all the fellas dub\nAnd murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of\nSo just remember when I bomb your set\nYo, I only cuss to make your mom upset\nCum on everybody -- get down tonight\n",
