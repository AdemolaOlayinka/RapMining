    "lyrics": "A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..\nHell yeah I'm afraid of death\nI don't want to die yet\nA lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..\nthat I do all types of.. retarded shit\nLook, I can't change the way I think\nAnd I can't change the way I am\nBut if I offended you? Good\nCause I still don't give a fuck\nI'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo\nHopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint\nA lyricist without a clue, what year is this?\nFuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this\nLivin amuk, never givin a fuck\nGimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck\nBut I smoke dope in a cab\nI'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab\nCome back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)\nA killer instinct runs in the blood\nEmptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud\nI've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs\nI could walk around straight for two months with a buzz\nMy brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn\nThe rest of my body's still bein operated on\nI'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme\nCause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time\n\nFor all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you\nTo all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!\nTo all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past\nBut the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS\nFor all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do\nTo all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!\nFor everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past\nBut I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS\n\nI walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you\nAnd cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue\nI'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles\nAnd pull you apart from both angles\nI wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins\nAnd bust open like broken water mains\nSo tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb\nCause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm\nGot your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm\nSo big my entire arm is a giant firebomb\nBuy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on\nAnd the pants to match (\"Here momma try em on\")\nI get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,\na brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives\n(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents\nGod help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again\n\n\nI wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it\nSpend a million a track and went over my budget (Ohh shit!)\nNow how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?\nI can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet\nDrug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches\nI'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches\nI don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches\nGive me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes\nNever ran with a click - I'm a posse\nKamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me\nFrom the second I was born, my momma lost me\nI'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy\nI don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place\nMy worst day on this earth was my first birthday\nRetarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?\nFuck, I was born during the earthquake\n",
