    "lyrics": "Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (huh?)\nTold you how to slap dicks and murder your girl (I did!)\nGave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl\nSold a billion tapes and still screamed, \"Fuck the world!\"\n(I'm Slim Shady..) so come and kill me while my name's hot\nAnd shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)\nI think I got a generation brainwashed\nto pop pills and smoke pot til they brains rot (uhh-oh)\nStop they blood flow until they veins clot\nI need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch\nPurple haze and acid raindrops\nSpike the punch at the party and drink pop (gulp gulp)\nShaved my armpits and wore a tank top\nBad Boy, I told you that I can't stop\nYou gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you\nSo everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin\n(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!\n\nI like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)\nI like birds, bees, I like people\nI like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)\nlike when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)\nThe ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike\nwhile I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like\ncause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)\nI don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (uh-huh)\nHow you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat\nwhen they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)\nSo bring the money by tonight - cause your wife\nsaid this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)\nI try to keep it positive and play it cool\nShoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)\nCause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better\nTonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin\n(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!\n\nYo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it\n(Aww that shit is wack!)\nSix months later you hear your lyrics on my shit\n(What?? That's my shit!)\nPeople don't buy shit no more they just dub it\nThat's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)\nBut they love it when you make your business public\nso fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)\nAnd if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it\ncause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it\n-- Well, I do take pills, don't do speed\nDon't do crack (uh-uhh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)\nDon't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)\nI just wanna make a few things clear\nMy baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)\nAnd I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin\nIt's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested\nI don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested\nI got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets\nI'm your brother when you need, some good weed to set you free\nYou know me, I'm your friend, when you need a minithin\n(I'm Slim Shady..) I'm Shady!!\n(Ha hah-ha, ha! Ha hah, hah..) I told you I was Shady!!\n(Ha hah-ha, hah-ha! Ha hah, hah-ha, hah-ha, hah-ha)\nY'all didn't wanna believe me!\nI'm Shady!!\n.. And that's my name\n",
