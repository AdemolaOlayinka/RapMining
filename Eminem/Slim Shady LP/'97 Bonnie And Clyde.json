She's takin a little nap in the trunk\nOh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk\nNow I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin\nBut you know your mama, she's one of those type of women\nthat do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit\nDon't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)\nAnd don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?\nDon't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)\nAnd mama said she wants to show how far she can float\nAnd don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat\nIt's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin\ndinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt\nMama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water\nand me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nSee honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell\nA place called prison and a place called jail\nAnd da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one\nCause mama's got a new husband and a stepson\nAnd you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)\nMaybe when you're old enough to understand a little better\nI'll explain it to ya\nBut for now we'll just say mama was real real bad\nShe was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad\nBut I still feel sad that I put her on time-out\nSit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)\nI told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?\nTake a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?\nHer make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee\nClean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty\nYour dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water\nNinety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nWake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway\nwe're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier\nBaby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea\nMama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)\nThat's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry\nDa-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake\nHere, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)\nWe'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock\nReady now, here we go, on the count of free..\nOne.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)\nThere goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta\nNo more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order\nNo more step-da-da, no more new brother\nBlow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)\nNow we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk\nBut first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nJust the two of us..\nAnd when we ride!\nJust the two of us..\nJust you and I!\nJust the two of us..\n\nJust me and you baby\nis all we need in this world\nJust me and you\nYour da-da will always be there for you\nYour da-da's always gonna love you\nRemember that\nIf you ever need me I will always be here for you\nIf you ever need anything, just ASK\nDa-da will be right there\nYour da-da loves you\nI love you baby\n",
