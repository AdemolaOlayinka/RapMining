    "lyrics": "In my mind I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter\nMy soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up\nArsenic writer, author with arthritis\nCarpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis\nHard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed,\nDick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick\nQuick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics\nWho wait for me to slip with it so quick\nThis dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute\nSome lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly\nDo not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit\nSo stop dwelling and I am not failing\nYou fuckers are not ready, 'cause I got jelly like (Beyonce's) pot belly\nThis is Destiny, yes money I'm off running\nSo get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening\n\nNo apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry\nYou can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me\nNo apologies, y'all feelin' the force of me\nNo remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me\nNo apologies, not even acknowledging you at all\n'til I get a call that god's coming\nNo apologies, laugh fuckers it's all funny\nI can spit in ya face while your standin' across from me, no apologies\n\nMy head hits the pillow, a weeping willow, I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows\nBut these cellos help just to keep me mellow, hand's on my head, touched knees to elbow\nI'm hunched over, emotion just flows over, these cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me\nI keep saying it, I can't stress it enough, so keep playing it and stand next to the subs\nI choke mic's like asphyxiation when I'm stranglin' my own throat masturbatin'\nFuck yeah I'm a basket case and I mastered this rap shit, 'til my ass gets wasted, 'til my assassination,\n'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation\n44 mags a fascination, a taste for disaster and if that's the case then...\n\n\nThis song isn't for you, it's for me, a true MC\nIt's what it do just to see if he still has it\nAnd if his skills mastered,\nHe's able to spill raps long after his killed, that's a real MC\nGot you feelin' me, whether willing or unwillingly\nYou still agree, as long as there's still this hunger and will in me\nThen expect a longer life expectancy\nI'd be a savage beast if I ain't have this outlet to salvage me inside\nI'd be exploding soaked in self loathing an mourning\nSo I'm warning you, don't coax me\nIt's silly, I'm really a sheep in wolf's clothing\nWho only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be fooled\nThe press blows up this whole thing, it's stupid\nThey don't know 'cause they don't see that I'm wounded\nAll they did was ballooned it\nI'm sick of talkin' 'bout these tattoos cartoon did\nThat's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of dukin'\nAnd they can suck my dick while I'm pukin', and you too, you can\n\nExpect no sympathy from me I'm an MC\nThis is how I'm supposed to be\nCold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat\nSo expect no apologies\n",
