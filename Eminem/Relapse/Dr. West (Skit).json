Come on, Marshall, you're a big boy now, sounding like a bit of a baby\nYou can do this; you found a sponsor yet?\nUm, not yet, I mean, but when I get back\nWell, if you find one, you find one; if you don't, you don't\nWell, yeah, I mean, I gotta start going to meetings first and\nWait, what?\nWell, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings\nAnd it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your schedule\nWe know you're a busy person\nBut I thought variety was the most important thing?\nSo what else are you thinking?\nUm, well, I know I gotta start practicing the steps\nAnd, I mean, learning them, and start being able to apply them\nSteps?\nYeah, steps\nThere's a lot of them, aren't there?\nWell, twelve\nChrist, I don't even know them all\nReally?\nAnything else?\nUm, well, I mean the only other question I have was like\nWhat do I do if I find myself in a situation where\nMaybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to?\nTake a drink\nWhat?\nTake a drink and, you know, take the edge off\nTake the edge off?\nMan, if I ever take a drink, I already know what that's gonna lead me to\nWhat, you mean these?\nMan, what the fuck?\nMarshall, what's the matter, darling?\nHaving some doubts already?\nMarshall, you can't leave me\nYou'll never leave me, Marshall\nWe'll always be together, Marshall\nMarshall? Marshall?\nNo, no, no, no, no\nOh, shit\n",
