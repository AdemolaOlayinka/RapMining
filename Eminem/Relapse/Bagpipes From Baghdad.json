All I asked for was a glass of punch\nYou see I never really asked for much\nI can't imagine what's goin' through you mind\nAfter such a nasty break up\nWith that Latin hunk Luis Miguel\nNick Cannon better back the fuck up\nI'm not playin', I want her back you punk\nThis is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk\nMixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk\nZap and Eric Clapton shaft brings Abba crunk\nAnd yeah baby, I want another crack at ya\nYou can beat me with any spatula that you want\nI mean I really want ya bad, you cunt\nNick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk\nMan, I could use a fresh batch of blood\nSo prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture\n\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nWhen will it ever cease for Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nWhat's goin' through my mind half the time\nWhen my rhyme are blowin' up my\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nSomebody turn the 'Vacancy' sign on 'cause I'm gone blowin' up my\nBagpipes from Baghdad\nI run the streets and act like a mad man holdin' a glad\nYou can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture\nI'm the miracle whip, a trickster\nMy signature sound when the tube of lipsticks surround\nI'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow, man\nWhat an ensemble, what an assortment of pharmaceuticals\nThis beautiful pill dust in my palm\nCuticles get residue just from touching the bottle\nNever knew I could remind me so much of my mama\nI cut you like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya\nThe size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja\nGet it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin' ya Norman\nYou're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy\nYou don't know what the fuck you're doin'\nI ain't playin' no fuckin' more\nNick Cannon you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore\nEvery minute there's a sucka born\nSnuck up on Malakai and made the motherfuckers suck\nOn a shucka corn\nShucka, shucka corn, shucka corn\nHit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fuckin' on\nNow what the fuck are ya doin'? You're runnin' over the snow blower\nWith the lawnmower blowing your bagpipes from Baghdad\n\nIn the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables\nI bet you they become heterosexual\nNothin' will stop me from molestin' you\nTitty fuckin' you 'till your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles\nIs what they said, to the two conjoined twins\n\"How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend?\"\nYou need some ointment, just set up an appointment\nWho's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip\nI just got my one year sobriety coin chip\nWhen the bad get goin', how bad does the goin' get?\nBaby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin' groins with\nEach other, especially when you're joined at the hip\nI'm goin' to get the needle and thread from the sowin' kit\nAnd attempt to separate 'em, and stitch them back at the loins, shit\nKnew the little boy with the chocolate chips, ahoy chip\nCookie looky, even took me a Polaroid\n",
