All over the globe Same song and dance Something about it man\nSame song and dance In the Pale Moonlight Yo...\n\nI'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl Your kind of tookin' back by The whole rapper thing aren't ya?\nProbably thinkin' you'll get slapped so dang hard ya Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?\nCouple rape charges, people think you're a monster\nThe police constantly buggin' ya non-stop I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya\nI think ya got your OnStar button inside your car stuck.\nYou outta gas, do you gotta flat?\nI would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat I got your back\nWhy don't you put your laundry basket in the back\nAnd sit up front, not askin' it's a trap\nYou just got jacked and body snatched and it's a rap\nIn broad day, with no mask for this attack I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract\nIf that's a fact, it'll take task force to get ya back\nC'mon\n\nYeah baby, do that dance It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do\nGirl shake that ass You ain't ever gonna break that glass\nThe windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song\nIt's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing\nYou sexy little thing Show me what you got, give it your all\nLook at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?\nSame song and dance...\n\nThe first victim I had, she was a big one Big movie star, a party girl, big fun\nShe was the girl the media always picked on In and out of rehab, every 4 to 6 months\nShe was always known for little pranks and slick stunts\nAnd Nickelodeon flashed her little kids once\nWhat an event it was,\nI was sitting in front I was hooked in it the first glimpse of them buns\nSeen her back stage now here's where I come in son\nLook here she comes I better pull out the big guns\nHello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun\nHow bout a ride to rehab, get in cunt\nStarting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want\nGirl I'm just kidding let me start over again hun\nSee what I meant was, we should have a little intervention\nCome with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension\nYou little Wench ya, murder wasn't my intention If I wanted to kill you it would of already been done\nSlowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her With sixty-six inches of extension... cord.\n\nYeah baby, do that dance It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do\nGirl shake that ass You ain't ever gonna break that glass\nThe windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song\nIt's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing\nYou sexy little thing Show me what you got, give it your all\nLook at you bawl, why you cryin' to me? Same song and dance...\n\nMy second victim was even bigger then the first\nPop star, icon, the whole works\nShe played a little schoolgirl when she first burst\nUpon the scene and seen that the world was hers\nShe twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts\nIt irked me and made me mad at first I lashed out through my songs but what was really going on\nWas that I had developed a crush I just didn't know how to tell it to her...\nShould I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?\nSend her pictures of my collections of skeletons of, footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?\nWe'll settle this once and for all, I'mma tell her at dusk Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must\nCreep up, to her mansion in stilettos and just climb the gate and ring the bell like hello my love,\nI just picked your prescription for Seroquel up!\nNow would you like to share a pill or two with me?\nI'll share my valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney!\nI'll trade you a blue one for a pink one Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent\nI've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you\nHold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value\nCome-on toots, give me the valium alleyoop...\nI'll slam dunk it in your mouth til you puke\nAnd just as soon you pass out in your alphabet soup I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit out of you\nNew outfit? Shit I'll make a suit out of you\nShoot! Now show me how you move baby do how well ya do\n\nYeah baby, do that dance\nIt's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do\nGirl shake that ass\nYou ain't ever gonna break that glass\nThe windshields too strong for you I said yeah baby, sing that song\nIt's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing\nYou sexy little thing\nShow me what you got, give it your all\nLook at you bawl, why you cryin' to me?\nSame song and dance...\n\nSame kickin' and screamin' same cryin' and sobbin' Same song and dance...\nSame diggin' and pleadin' same yellin' and bleedin' Same song and dance\nYeah Same song and dance know Same song and dance\n",
