This is your fucking captain speaking\nWe will soon be reaching an altitude of four million and a half feet\nThat's eight million miles in the sky\nPlease, undo your seatbelt for takeoff\nYou are now free to smoke about the cabin\n\nI'm Dre from back in the day from NWA from black and the gray from\nChoking a bitch to smacking her face from\nStacking up bodies to\nRacking their kegs up from Racking a bitch to\nStacking them crates up\nI'm still hungry\nAnd I'm back with a tapeworm\nAnd we was happening and rapping and tame at me\nShady for us competition Faggot, There ain't none\nSpeak of the devil It's attack of the rain man\nChainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron\nSoon as the blade spun run, they run away from\nWho wanna play dungeon?\nNo one is safe from In search of a brain surgeon\nA great one\nWait, the day ain't funny man It's urgent\nI need one\nTwo boxes of detergent and a paint gun\nAnd an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1\n\nSo one more time for old time's sake\nDre, drop that beat and scratch that brake\nNow just blow a little bit of that smoke my way And let's go\nYou are now smoking with the best (the best)\n\nSmoke signal in the sky like Verizon wireless\nA nice environment\nSurprised, entirely hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrants\nTaking lives of firemen Say goodbye, here I am again Naked wives and vicadin\nBefore I begin to get so high; pussy boy, I could spin Fin, fin\nFuck the handle I fly off the hinge Let that boy off the bench, coach and throw it to him\nThere he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again\nBaby, make us some French toast and show us some skin\nI show you every inch grows of my foreskin\nShow me nipple I pinch, throw up, and throw up a ten\nNow you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again\nThe sorcerer of intercourse - if it's forced, it's him\nDon't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within\nAnd when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain\n\nSo one more time for old time's sake\nDre, drop that beat and scratch that brake\nNow just blow a little bit of that smoke my way\nAnd let's go You are now smoking with the best (the best)\n\nNow where there's smoke, there's fire Where there's fire, there's flames\nWhere there's flames, there's chronic\nEither you high or you ain't\nI got no time for no games Nah uh, he ain't playin'\nHe's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain I'm slightly insane Vodka and kreatine Hypnotic and red bull\nIt's an incredible energy drink And it's given me wings I believe I can fly\nWhile I pee on a girl You won't catch me, CSI It's as easy as pie\nAnd as simple as cake Dre, get on the mic and make them dribble and shake\n\nNow put your smoke up in the air And raise your henny and coke\nAnd if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know\nWe can smoke till there's no more lighter fluid to do it\nLets get into it You smoking with the triest and truest\nI got the Midas touch When it comes to rolling shit up\nYou motherfuckas ain't smoking\nYou just holding shit up Now here we go\nLet's get up, get down, hold up a blunt\nI smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one\nCuz if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed\nNow them words are just a little more personal for me\nSeeing is how I blew up off of puffing them trees Well puffing ain't enough for me\nFuck yeah, light it up Cheech, come on Smoke me out, cuz\nGive me contact buzz\nGet me on track They love me when I'm on that stuff\nBut this earth calling Shady, man come on back (what?)\nMan we're losing him; he won't even respond back (fuck!)\nNow look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)\nDre, it's hot\nI think we better go check on their temperatures I give them the thermometer\nYou get the bandages Now baby just bend over\nThis won't hurt a damn bit,\n\nAnd give me one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake\nNow just blow a little bit of that smoke my way\nAnd let's go\nYou are now smoking with the best (the best)\nI said one more time for old time's sake Dre, drop that beat and scratch that brake\nNow just send a little bit of that smoke my way\nAnd let's go\nYou are now smoking with the best (the best)\n",
