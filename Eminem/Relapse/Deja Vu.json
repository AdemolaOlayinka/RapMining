    "lyrics": "D.M.C. we have a mid 30s male\nFound down unresponsive\nPossible over dose\nSubstance unknown\nPulse is 60 and thready\nRespiration's 8 he's intubated\nAnd we're bagging him now\nUuh B.P. 90 over palp\nPatient cool pale and diaphoretic\nHas aspirated\nUuh G.S.C. is 3\nWe'll update en route\nE.T.A. 10 minutes\nAs I fall deeper into a manic state\nI'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait\nBlood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate\nI seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate\nStart off with the NyQuil like I think I'll just have a taste\nCouple of sips of that then I gradually graduate\nTo a harder prescription drug called Valium like ya that's great\nI go to take just one and I end up like having eight\nNow I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate\nMaybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak\nAnd you'd think with all I have at stake\nLook at my daughter's face... \"Mommy, something is wrong with dad, I think.\nHe's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me.\nWon't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me.\nAnd all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos.\nAnd he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat.\"\nSometimes I feel so alone,\nI just don't know,\nFeels like I been down this road before.\nSo lonely and cold.\nIt's like something takes over me,\nSoon as I go home and close the door.\nKinda feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nI wanna get away from this place I do.\nBut I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't\nAnd why? I just don't know...\nMaybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer\nThat's the devil in my ear I been sober a fucking year\nAnd that fucker still talks to me he is all I can fucking hear\nMarshall, come on, we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers.\nAnd maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed for half of the time\nWho's that mastermind behind that little line?\nWith that kind of rational man I got half a mind\nTo have another half of glass of wine sound asinine\nYa I know\nBut I never had no problem with alcohol\nOuch, look out for the wall aim for the couch I'm about to fall\nI missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball\nShit must have knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all\nWow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?\nMan fuck am I hungover and god damn I got a head ache\nShit half a Vicodin, why can't I?\n\"All systems ready for take off, please, stand by\"\nSometimes I feel so alone,\nI just don't know,\nFeels like I been down this road before,\nSo lonely and cold,\nIt's like something takes over me,\nSoon as I go home and close the door,\nKinda feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nI wanna get away from this place I do.\nBut I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't\nAnd why? I just don't know...\nSo I take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ah\nA couple weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high\nNow I need it just not to feel sick ya I'm getting by\nWouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die\nOh ya there's an excuse you lose proof so you use\nThere's new rules it's cool if it's helping you to get through\nIt's twelve noon ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze\nWhat else is new? Fuck it, what would Elvis do in your shoes?\nNow here I am three months later full blown relapse\nJust get high until the kids get home from school homes relax\nAnd since I'm convinced that I'm insomniac I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take 3 naps\nJust to be able to function throughout the day let's see\nThat's an Ambien each nap how many Valium? Three.\nAnd that will average out to about one good hours sleep\nOK, so now you see the reason how come he\nHas taken four years just to put out an album beat\nSee me and you we almost had the same outcome heath\nCause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing\nIt was Bologna was it the methadone ya think\nOr the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos\nYour VCR tape cases with you Ambient CR great places to hide ain't it\nSo you can lie to Hallie\nI'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina\nGo in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance\nThey said they found me on the bathroom floor... Damn\nSometimes I feel so alone,\nI just don't know,\nFeels like I been down this road before,\nSo lonely and cold,\nIt's like something takes over me,\nSoon as I go home and close the door.\nKinda feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\nI wanna get away from this place I do.\nBut I can't and I won't say I tried but I know that's a lie cause I don't.\nAnd why? I just don't know...\n",
