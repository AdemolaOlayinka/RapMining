Who's got the rubbers?\nI notice there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us.\nand ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.\nIt's on till the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\nOK... let's go\nBack wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk\nFix your musk, you'll just be another one bit the dust\nJust one of my mothers son who got thrown under the bus\nKiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts\nIt disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks\nIt's a must I redeem my name 'n' haters get mushed.\nBitches lust. Man, they love me when I lay in the cut.\nFist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.\nNow picture us. it's ridiculous you curse at the thought\n'Cause when I spit the verse the shit\nGets worse then Worcestershire sauce\nIf I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time\nEvery verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes\nIt's elementary. The elephants have entered the room.\nI venture to say we're the center of attention it's true\nNot to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal\nOf the bat symbol. The platinum trio's back on you hoes.\n\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto\nO-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes\nNow where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI notice there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us.\nand ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.\nIt's on till the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\nLadies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre\n\nThey see that low rider go by, they're, like, \"Oh, my!\"\nYou ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why.\nI dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre.\nI'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.\nBut hey, what else can I say? I love LA.\n'Cause over and above all, it's just another day\nAnd this one begins where the last one ends.\nPick up where we left off and get smashed again.\nI'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz.\nDriving around with a smashed front end\nLet's cash that one in.\nGrab another one from out the stable\nThe Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado\nThe hell if I know.\nDo I want leather seats or vinyl?\nDecisions, decisions\nGarage looks like Precision Collision.\nOr Maaco beats quake like Waco\nJust keep the bass low speakers away from your face though\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto\nO-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes\nNow where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI notice there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us.\nand ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.\nIt's on till the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\nAnd I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent\n\nIt's bottle after bottle\nThe money ain't a thing when you party with me\nIt's what we into, it's simple\nWe ball out of control like you wouldn't believe\nI'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong\nGet rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on\nI'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm\nBring the shaun dawn, burn marajaun, do what you want\nNigga, on and on till the break of what\nGet the paper, man, I'm caking, you know, I don't give a fuck\nI spend it like it don't mean nothing\nBlow it like it's supposed to be blown\nMotherfucker I'm grown\nI stunt, I style, I flash the shit\nI gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick\nFat ass burgundy bags, classy shit, Jimmy Choos shoes\nI say move a bitch move\nSo crack a bottle, let your body waddle\nDon't act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto\nO-oh o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe\nGot one riding shotgun and no not one of 'em got clothes\nNow where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?\nI notice there's so many of 'em\nAnd there's really not that many of us.\nand ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust.\nIt's on till the break of dawn\nAnd we're starting this party from dusk\n",
