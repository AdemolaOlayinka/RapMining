Come here\nTalk to me, sit here, pull up a chair\nWhy don't you cut your hair? Hahahahaha\nDye it back, come on, try it\" AHHHHHHHHH\nNo, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?\n\"But I'm here to rebuild you\", But I already killed you!\n\"But Shady, we were meant for eachother\nThink about your mother\", yeah so what of her?\n\"Well think about what she did to you and your little brother\nAll them foster homes...\", fuck you motherfucker!\nI had you beat \"No I was playin' possom, remember?\nI let you watch your little girls blossom\nI gave you enough time, your souls mine\nI'm taking it back\", you fucking bitch WHY!\n\"Because I love you, look a little closer\nIsn't that us on that poster? haha\"\n\nMy Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me\nMy Darling, you and me were meant to be together\nMy Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my\nMy Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\nI don't ever want you to leave me\nMy Darling, you and me were meant to be together\nMy Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my\nMy Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\n\n\"Shady, listen... \"SHADY!\", you hear that?\nThey're screaming for you, I can bring your career back\"\nBut I don't want it back! \"Yes you do...\"\nNo I don't! \"Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!\"\nNo I won't! \"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor\"\nGo ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday\n\"Well I got him on the phone right now!\"\nYou're lying, \"yo slim\", HOW, WHY NOW!\nWhatup Dre? \"Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya\nI don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya\nDrugs, you became a lot softer\"\nBut Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka\n\"Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here\nJust hit me back, and let me know what's up\"\nFuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH\n\"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you\"\nFuck you, die you son of a bitch\n\"Put the gun down\", BYE BYE!\nOk I'm still alive, \"So am I too!\nYou can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to\nHaha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?\nYou remember that night you, prayed to god\nYou'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you\nThis is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through\nLook at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!\nOh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too\nThat you're just now seeing the downside to\nLose your best friend from highschool, your wife too\nAin't even sure if your kids like you\nCome off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill\nBecome a valium addict, start a rehab cycle\nBut together we can break the cycle\nMarshall...\" WHAT! \"no one's gonna love you like I do!\"\n\nMy Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me\nMy Darling, you and me were meant to be together\nMy Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my\nMy Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\nI don't ever want you to leave me\nMy Darling, you and me were meant to be together\nMy Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my\nMy Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\nI said, I don't ever want you to leave me\nMy Darling, you and me were meant to be together\nMy Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my\nMy Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body\n",
