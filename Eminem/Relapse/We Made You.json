Did you miss me?\nJessica Simpson, sing the chorus!\n\nWhen you walked through the door, it was clear to me (Clear to me!)\nYou're the one who they adore, who they came to see (Who they came to see!)\nYou're a rockstar (Baby!)\nEverybody wants you (Everybody wants you)\nPlayer!\nWho could really blame you? (Who could really blame you?)\nWe're the ones who made you!\n\nBack by popular demand\nNow pop a little Zantax or antacid if you can\nYou're ready to tackle any task that is at hand\nHow does it feel: Is it fantastic, is it grand?\nWell look at all the massive masses in the stands\nShady man, no, don't massacre the fans\nDamn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man\nShe stomped him, just 'cause he asked to put his hands\nOn her massive, gluteus maximus again\nSqueeze it and squash it and pass it to a friend\nCan he come back as nasty as he can?\nYes he can, Cam, don't ask me this again\nHe does not mean to lesbian offend\nBut Lindsay, please come back to seein' men\nSamantha's a two, you're practically a ten\nI know you want me girl, in fact I see ya grin\nNow come in girl!\n\n\nThe enforcer, look at the more women to torture\nWalk up to the cutest girl and Charlie-horse her\nSorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres\nHave that I don't? Are you tellin' me tenderness?\nWell I could be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman\nGive me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine\nAnd I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then\nNail her, maybe say, \"Hello to my little friend\"\nBrit, forget K-Fed, let's cut out the middleman\nForget him or you'll end up in the hospital again\nAnd this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge\nForget them other men, girl pay them little attention\nAnd little did I mention that Jennifer's in love with me John Mayer, so sit on the bench\nMan, I swear them other guys you give 'em an inch\nThey take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim\n\nAnd that's why, my love, you never live without\nI know you want me girl\n'Cause I can see you checkin' me out\nAnd baby, you know, you know you want me too\nDon't try to deny it, baby, I'm the only one for you\n\nDamn girl, I'm beginning to sprout then Alfalfa\nWhy should I wash my filthy mouth out?\nYou think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album\nNever has their been such finesse and nostalgia\nMan Cash, I don't mean to mess with ya gal but\nJessica Alba, put a breast in my mouth, bruh\nWowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers\nAnd they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis\nLord help us, he's back and in his pink Alf shirt\nLookin' like someone shrinked his outfit\nI think he's bout to flip, Jessica\nRest assured, Superman's here to rescue ya\nCan you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake\nMatter fact, make me a birthday cake\nWith a sawblade in it to make my jailbreak\nBaby, I think you just met your soulmate\nNow break it down, girl!\n\n\nSo baby, baby\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, get down (Baby!)\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, down, down (Baby!)\nGet down, get down\n\nOh Amy!\nRehab never looked so good!\nI can't wait!\nI'm going back!\nHaha! Whoo!\nDr. Dre\n2020\nYeah!\n",
