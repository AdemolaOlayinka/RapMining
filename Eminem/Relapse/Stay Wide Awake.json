vrim! and now you see just how the\nFuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp, uh\nShit wait a minute I mean skull my knife seems dull\nPull another one out, Uh!\n\nSoon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart\nEven though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't\nBoy you think you're clever don't ya\nGirl you think you're so smart\nCome with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark Stay Wide Awake\n\nA world so dark\nA world so cold\nA world where only some will go\nBut not return, when will they learn\nWere do they go, god only knows\nStay Wide Awake\n\nSo dark and so cold my friends don't know this other side of me\nThere's a monster inside of me it's quite ugly and it frightens me\nBut they can't see what I can see there's a vacancy in my tummy\nIt's makin' me play hide n' seek like Jason I'm so hungry\nShe's naked see no privacy but I can see she wants me\nSo patient see I try to be but Gee why does she taunt me\nPulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep\nAnd I creep right through the front see\nSo blatantly but silently cuz I know that she's sound asleep\nWho's wakin' me so violently and why is he on top of me\nHe's rapin' me she try's to scream somebody please get him off me\nHe's tapin' me he's biting me he's laughing likes it's funny\nShe's scrapin' me she's fightin' me she's scratching like some dumb freak\nEscapin' me no dice ya see I might just be Ted Bundy\nOr Satan gee what a site to see I'm dancing in my red panties\nI'm crazy but it's alright with me man life can be so empty\nStay away from cuz I'm dancing to quite a different drum beat\n\nSoon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart\nEven though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't\nBoy you think you're clever don't ya\nGirl you think you're so smart\nCome with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark Stay Wide Awake\n\nA world so dark\nA world so cold\nA world where only some will go\nBut not return, when will they learn\nWere do they go, god only knows\nStay Wide Awake\n\nBetter try to stay wide awake or you might be found dead by the lake\nSoon as you lay me down to sleep bitch your soul I'm a try to take\nPray for light today right away why do they try to fight today\nI must make them pay twice as much might as well put the knife away\nNow I use power tools how 'bout now are you in the shower\nScour you for 6 hours till outage your power outlets\nHow did ya figure out I was down in your basement now ya\nMust of just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there\nPower there's no one fowler bound ya the tub they found ya\nFace down in the tub I drown you with piles of downers around ya\nSuch nostalgia and power such prowess look how you cower\nJumped out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' star wars\nJabba the Hut be di bye bye, be di bye bye it's time to die die\nOught to not even bother to scream it don't even matter\nAmazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya\nNot your everyday Damien bath me in holy water\nMelting like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand\nWhere's the thrill in a hunt there's no fun in that here I come with axe\nOnce I act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' him up with that\nWhat was that dial 911 someone's comin' in from the back\n\nSoon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart\nEven though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't\nBoy you think you're clever don't ya\nGirl you think you're so smart\nCome with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark\nStay Wide Awake\n\nA world so dark\nA world so cold\nA world where only some will go\nBut not return, when will they learn\nWere do they go, god only knows\nStay Wide Awake\n",
