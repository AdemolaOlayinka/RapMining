Good to see ya man)\nLook who decided to show his face!\nI hope you've had fun in the last 4 years.\n(Look man, I apologise again for-)\nFor shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?\n(Again, it was a mistake,) (a terrible mist- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?)\nand then you go and you do what? hide out? stay in Detroit from us 5 years while the music industry melts the fuck down?\nDo you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin vacation?\n(Well that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna, put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion)\nDo I really need to hear it?\nLet me guess, another album about poor me, I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life, and I'm such a tortured artist.\nLet me make music about it and my tragic love life, am I on to something here? (Come on man it's not like that yo-)\nYou know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over I'm done talkin to you. Think you can just come and go as you please.\nBig selfish superstar (Steve, I had a drug problem)\nOh poor me, I had a drug problem.\nWho hasn't had a drug problem in this town? You know what?\n\n(Hey! hey!) Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out (Woah, woah, woah. Jesus Christ man!)\n(Alright alright here, fine) What's this shit? Two CD's?\n(That's what I've been tryin to tell you man, there's 2 albums)\nJust get out! (Alright!)\nGet the fuck out (Alright man, see you later)\n",
