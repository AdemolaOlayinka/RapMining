Bring in a truckload with a high-low\nMy name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips\nScrewdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up\nI came in this game with, bad intentions\nAnd I ain't budged, not even an inch since then\nLava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp\nI'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass\nGot my self esteem back, got my confidence up\nI'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut\nShady man, I done told you once homie to easy up\nBut you just won\u2019t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not\n",
