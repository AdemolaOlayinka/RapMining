I'm allergic to pussy, sluts too\nYeah, you think you the shit, till we flush you\nHave some bullshit to readjust\nStill got a just a few of us left, but it'd be unjust to rob us our just due\nSo rest in peace to Bugz and proof\nThis one's for you homies, we love you\nBut we can't stop now we done had too much of our blood drew from this...\n\nFame, fame, fame\nI think it's got me goin' crazy\nOhhhohhh\nI get lost in this game, game, game\nI'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers\nOhhhohhh\nKeep speaking my name, name, name\nYou gon' have reason to hate me\nYeahhhheahhh\nIt's like. you. don't. want. me to win\nSo. this. time.
