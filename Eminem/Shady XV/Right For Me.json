wouldn't make her my main squeeze\nbut juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer\nit's mouth waterin' too so i walked up to it like i'm marshall\nwanna try to meet my standards? i'll introduce ya\noh i'm a misogynist too but i'm not a masseuse\nbut my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth\na chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana\ni mean verbal assault that i use to smoke all of you losers\ngot a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a glock, and a nuke\nand a rottweiler too, i'm not in the mood so\nwhen i say i'm bringing the tec out\ni'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers\ngod, i'm gonna puke\ni'm so gone off the hookah\ni think i swallowed a loofah\ni'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like oliver\nlike i looked medusa in the eyeball to seduce her\nthe thoughts i produce are loony tunes\nthe box of usable latex gloves and the socks and the shoes\nto replace next up veronica's boobs\nand a paychecks that were stuffed in a glove box\nin a blue honda with used condoms were clues\nthe girl was just not the one suitable for him\n\nright for me will change me rearrange my head to be\njust right for you and me don\u2019t laugh, please listen\ndon\u2019t laugh, please listen\nthought i could endure the pressure\ncollapse and crumble perhaps\nrelapsing under that\nwell that's a bunch of crap\nin the clutch, i'm the captain crunch of rap\nand i'm sick of acting humble thats enough of that\nfuck that shit, cut the sack\nlike its a natural reaction\nthat's why i'm actually trapped in this shoving match\ncause push keeps coming to that\ni can keep getting my ass kicked, keep it coming back\nlike a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit so mad\ndisgruntled had some struggles yeah\nbut that passionate hunger's back\nthe fantastic juggling act\nand the way i flip my tongue on the track\nit's like verbal acrobatics\nbut in fact\nlast time i tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic\ni fuckin' crashed my hovercraft\nafter i strapped the duffel bag to my back\nand stuck the massive punchin' bag in it\nan elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack\nand a piece of plastic bubble wrap\nwent spastic and fuckin' snapped\njumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid\nstumbled back, recovered, back flipped\nand landed on a gymnastic tumble mat\nand for my last trick, lunge on back lash\non a nasa shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half\nchuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal\nand just asked him to come crash\nand i go grab my go-go-gadget inflatable gigantic humongous mattress\nand ceramic construction hat\nrubbed my magic mushroom tat\nfell off then splat, get up from that\nface taped to a waste paper basket\nthrow up then gas, lungs collapse\nand that's more likely than finding someone that's\n\ncouple of shots of j\u00e4ger\npublic intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation\nflooded with thoughts of anger\nwhile i was away i know probably some of you got to thinkin'\n\"you're top ten ain't cha?\" stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy\nand stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation\nwhether you're punchin' a clock or famous\nunderground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is\ni came to fuck with your occupation\nyou're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs\nand you brought the scalpel and sponge\nthe oxygen tank and the suction and shot the brain surgeon\nstuck in the operating room\nonce you done, swapped your name with him\nsmuggled in ronald reagan\nif you duck him up donald fagen\nwhile juggling waffles baking\nfuckin' mcdonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle\nthey flung it across the table\nthen bump it and knock it shake it\njumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration\ni said fuck it and lost my patience\nsince they all woke up from sedation\nain't none of you doctor dre\nso then what does it got you thinkin'\nthat you can fuck with this operation\naftermath, still running hip-hop amazing\ni'm still pluggin' along\nno need for an assumption\nhere's confirmation\ni'm up for the long duration\ni'm just looking for something to walk away with\nsome pocket change and a little integrity\nthough i'll probably be jumpin' across the stage\ntill i'm fuckin' madonna's age and\nstuck in an awkward place in my life\nbut i shit you not like i'm fucked up with constipation\nthat day will come before i stumble upon some ladies\n",
