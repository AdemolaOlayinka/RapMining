    "lyrics": "Yo, if you could just, for one minute\nOr one split second in time, forget everything\nEverything that bothers you, all your problems\nEverything, and follow me\nIf I was frozen inside of a moment\nIf I could capture time inside a capsule\nAn hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it\nIf I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it\nThen I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it\nIf raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it\nThen I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks\nTo transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it\nAnd that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it\nYour passions too much for you to not be dancing to it\nAnd as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent\nYou're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish\nYou're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion\nTrue it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit\nUniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\nCause when we descend together, we begin to move as one\nIn perfect unison just like the moon and sun\nIlluminate the room and humans soon become aluminum\nRhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun\nBut if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go\nRelax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow\nTo rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me\nIf I could give the world a hit of ecstasy\nTo make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute\nCause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished\nSo close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it\nThe sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite\nA high percentage of black people and white mixed in it\nBut no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin'\nHis life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'\nLike life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\nLose yourself in this music\nThis moment we own it, we won't never let it go (go)\nYou better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait\nThere is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)\n",
