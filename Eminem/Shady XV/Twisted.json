    "lyrics": "You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here\nCan't you see that I've been crying?\nI didn't know you'd be insane\nDreams can be so deceiving\nYou're an itch I can't reach\nA wound that won't heal\nThe smell of skin that's burning\nI didn't know you'd be insane\nBut it's true, and just say all I am to you is a\n\nPain in my neck, thorn in my side\nStain on my blade, blood on my knife\nBeen dreaming of her, all of my life\nBut she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to\n\nShe's twisted, he's a rebel, she's sick, he's hard to handle\nThe worst of all is he just don't care\nShe's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around her throat\nBut the worst part of all is she really don't give a... (shit)\n(She don't give a shit)\n\nSometimes I wish that you'd just die\nCause I'm too afraid of leaving\nI didn't know you'd be insane\nDreams can be so deceiving\n(How did it come to this?\nWhy do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)\nI didn't know you feel the same\nWhen I say you're no good\nAll you are to me\n\nIs a pain in my neck, thorn in my side\nStain on my blade, blood on my knife\nBeen dreaming of her, all of my life\nBut she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to\n\n\nLove ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail\nInside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married?\nWell Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio\nIn the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold\nJuliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows\nNeither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show\nBut a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse, ain't it?\nSorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted\nSorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'\nIf a dollar makes you holler well then I'm gettin' the short change of it\nFeel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel\nEntangled between a dream and a coma\nWalkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner\nThen woke up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona\nNow if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them\nThen they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em\nYou gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel\nLove is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel\n'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows\nSome people go crazy and they lose control\nSome people jump off, some people won't let go\nSome people say love, some people say why\nSome people don't love, they just want a free ride\nThe rain won't stop, it'll never dry\nIf she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside\n\nMaybe I'm the twisted one that screwed this up\nSo I guess this means Goodbye, for now\n",
