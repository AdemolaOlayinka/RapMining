    "lyrics": "2014)\nI guess you could consider it poetry, but with me it started out with just words, just words.\nThey started looking like puzzle pieces so I started connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases.\nBy this time I was an artist so I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals, psychopathical killer\n(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer\nI'm a psychopath, I'm a killer\nA psychopath, I'm a killer\nA psychopath, I'm a killer)\nFeelin' it in the air, hanging in the night\nStaring at the full moon\nDid you ever think we would come to find?\nMaybe in my dreams\nI'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain\nLyrical murder is somethin' I've been about\nEver since I was a little kid, doodlin' in the class\nDrew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass\nWith a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off\nProlly symbolic of this thought, sick tot\nTo my inner enemy in a rush\nI'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams\nWith anything less than a full bank\nIt's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun\nI'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank\nThe hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't\nYeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard\nEvery award show, we don't even get considered\nHow do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical\nTo a kid that wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?\nNow I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit\nBefore me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit\nWe put the world onto us so watch how you say \"fuck me\"\nYou just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it\nCause I was in 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time\nI had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity\nAnd if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer\n(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)\nYou ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nPull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nCause ain't nobody iller\nKnowing nobody for realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nThis elite drinker, is a ringleader\nI'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher\nWith a street sweeper full of heat seekers\nIn your Jeep speakers I'm a keep ringers\nI don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver\nWelcome to the slaughterhouse\nNiggas try to tell me I spell too much\nCapital S to the laugh to the T-E-R\nHo, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word\nMaking work disappear quick as magic\nAbracadabra, the traffic blacker than Africa\nCan you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?\nMoney like Dracula, has him a spatula, ask me a question\nAm I the best with the flexing?\nFuck yes with the goon talk\nI just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street\nCROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller\nI'm a psychopath, I'm a killer\n(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)\nYou ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nPull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nCause ain't nobody iller\nKnowing nobody for realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nFeelin' it in the air, hanging in the night\nStaring at the full moon\nDid you ever think we would come to find?\nMaybe in my dreams\nThe thought of retiring\nIs makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron\nWhat up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?\nI'm hopin' to fill up your opening\nOh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements\nFirst I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and\nYou've probably already been with all the slaughter and iron men\nNo mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin\nWith no strings attached\nI'm just the product of a hostile environment\nBut bein' brought up so brought up inspired\nBut I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool\nNot an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme\nAnd it's like stars have aligned all in alliance\nHeart of a lion, balls of Goliath\nObscene talkin', the twine like a bean's talkin' and buyin'\nBut I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right\nBut everything I write seems wrong and it's like\nI'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause\nIn the fabric of our modern society\nNow Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans\nDammit the pope's mad again\nProbably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin\nSingin' \"Bagpipes from Baghdad\" again\nIn my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in, a glad bag\nWon't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance, like that again\nYou thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again?\nI've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've thought of another fucking line\nForgive me father, for I have sinned\nBut hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak\nDefiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet\nProbably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant\nAfter he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin' to sneak by it\nWhile his feet stomp follow me while I revive rap\nI'm a start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it\nYou're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in\nBoston, across the marathon finish line and I\nPut your thoughts against mine\nCause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar\nAnd I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire\nYour bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife\nA saberless Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight\nWith the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up\nI'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie\nPerform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end\nLike fuck 'em all and just ride\nLike I'm locked up inside a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car\nUncle Ronnie is driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door\nOf Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room\n(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)\nYou ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nPull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\nCause ain't nobody iller\nKnowing nobody for realer\n(A psychopath, I'm a killer)\n",
