I ain\u2019t ballin' ho\nWhat I look like, any baller you know? (Bane)\nYup, shots fired, callin' it kettle\nBlack shit turned the pot higher\nEyes tired\nKeep trying to sell me a smile, but I\u2019m a hard buyer\nKeep shit movin' like a car tire\nWhat you want a necklace\nI\u2019ll make you a chain out some barbed wire\n\n\nI got his Earth on my shoulders, real life for rappin'\nIf you threw the planet at me I\u2019d headbutt it and crack it\nOn another tax bracket and I been cleanin' my house\nBut my old habits are in the attic, I\u2019ll pull 'em out\nAnd keep reminding y'all you ain\u2019t got it all\nDevil keep pulling me by the drawers\nNot at all amazed at these haters\nYou\u2019ve seen my catalog\nSpeaking and we keep flying over 'em like a cannonball\nThink I\u2019m this comical, swag follower\nJust rhyming over beats\nWhile these leakers suckin' all of us off (hell no)\nStill got your mama covered in vomit in my cellphone\nY'all really got me fucked up\nWhat you mixin' up in that cup?\nWhat the hell you sprinkle in that blunt?\n.44, make him sober up\n\nI got an addiction to all these prescriptions\nNeed an intervention, someone to listen\nCatholic or Christian, fuck your suspicions\n(Bitch! Gimme my molly and stop bitchin'!)\nTurn it up (turn it down)\nI be blowing on half a pound\nPass it around and pass it around\nMerry go-round, merry go-round\nShe say she love me, but this bitch is ugly\n(Shit, you ain't even know it)\nI'mma still let her fuck me\n\n\nThey say the devil is a liar\nNigga don't worry 'bout that loud mouth\nBumping his gums and babbling\nWatch for them quiet niggas\nOn the real, you should come ride with us\nCrew full of riders; Optimus\nMy back, seems like you got your facts all crossed up, no Swastikas\nFadin' in and out of my consciousness\nTryna fight this feeling I\u2019m conjurin'\nThat's why I wear a hat so low with a mask\nReally feelin' like the Lochness\nNo bullshit, these bitches are more grimy\nDoing a nigga real slimey\nHad my little homie stretched out, death untimely\nNeed I remind me? Hold up\nYo, don\u2019t get doped up\nHeard rumors that niggas wanna clap at me\nWell actually, I was just over there\nNiggas ain\u2019t really do jack to me\nThat\u2019s why I keep this mask on, straight face\nOnly thing that\u2019s missing is my get my Runyon Ave soldiers\n",
