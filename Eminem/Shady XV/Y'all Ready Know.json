Wait up, straight up\nI finish niggas right off the bat like a layup\nI seen a lot of come, I seen a lot of go\nBut y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O\nYou know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different\nHere come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'\nMy ice mug frozen till it's stiff\nGrimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch\nI got a way with women, I faithfully play with women\nLet 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em\nI might just throw 'em a gold fronts\nPour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt\nI was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off\nNever had to retaliate cause I set it off\n\n\nYa'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language\nI'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt\nFirst we take oath\nThen I'm pulling turquoise strings in my Lebron corks In Turks and Caicos\nI came from wicked chair fame wearin' short sets\nI learned that money can't buy happiness\nBut I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette\nMake a dollar, buy a suit\nHave a child, and have 'em follow suit\nWavin' that weatherchange things\nMake the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose\nTaking everything from you know\nLet him finish his fall in his draws\nAnd pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot\nI'm about that Art Of War gospel\nThat Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe\nUsing the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow\nYour money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off\n\n\nLet's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth\nTruth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself\nFuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself\nIf what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps\nMade angel dust my freshman year\nGave it a try, cool, little did I knew\nHad the wrong meaning of high school\nTeachers called him a sociopath and a liar\nFuck them, only went to class for the cyphers\nNow I'm gettin' bills for\nThe same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for\nThey said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw\nVital, suicidal, said I would kill mi amour\nWasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off\nNever know who or what you might get\nMain reason they never want me to set it off\nYou now dealing with four niggas that's never off\nAll bets off, so nah, you won't be better off\n\n\nJewish tats arm on my arm like a Semitic boss\nEgyptian art hanging, uh, that's my Kemetic cross\nSlaughterhouse set it off\nEven got bitches wavin' our flag, Betsy Ross\nOld school Chevy, the head is off\nDecapitated Impala\nHeavy lack from the weight of the llama\nStill bear arms like a shaven koala\nHow you thinkin' like a faded neurology student\nIs prudent when chasin' a dollar\nSo never mind, a clever rhyme\nI'd rather find a better grind, forever times\nSittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine\nIn this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm\nI'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes\nSharon and Caroline\nShare a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind\nI probably shouldn't even keep going\nCause these rappers keep hoein' with their teeth showing\nI set it off\n",
