Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ & Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\nDo I really belong in this game? I pondered\nI just wanna' play my part, should I make waves or not?\nSo back and forth in my brain, the tug-o-war wages on\nI don't wanna' seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon\nBut sometimes you gotta' take a loss\nAnd have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off\nKeep pluggin', it's your only outlet\nAnd your only outfit so you know they're gonna' talk about it\nBetter find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah\nFeel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times\nHow many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?\nWhat I really wanna' say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story\nBet 'cha feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are\nWhen I was afraid ta'\n\nI was a... afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI don't wanna' go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear (the time is near)\nGuts over fear (I shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nAnd let you keep me down\nNow I got guts over fear, guts over fear\n\nFeels like a close, it's coming to\nFuck am I gonna do?\nIt's too late to start over\nThis is the only thing I, thing I know\n\nI know what it's like, I was there once, single parents\nHate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?\nAnd the pain spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on\nThat I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part\nWas soon as I stopped saying \"I gave a fuck\"\nHaters started to appreciate my art\nAnd it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused\nBut what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?\nAnd the lights go out in that trailer park?\nAnd the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows\nAnd I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from\nJust a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun\nSo to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song\nBut I'd rather make \"Not Afraid 2\" than make another motherfucking \"We Made You\", uh\nAnd I don't wanna' seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just opened enough eyes later on\nGave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use that'll make ya' strong\nEnough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt\n'Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust havin' to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells I was made to walk\nBut thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania,\nSo when they empty that stadium\n'Least I made it out ta that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done\nSo this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted\nI represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song\nAnd everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more\nFrom this day forward, just let them a-holes talk,\nTake it with a grain of salt and eat their fuckin' faces off\nThe legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone\nAnd to think I was a...\n\nI was a... afraid to make a single sound\nAfraid I would never find a way o-o-out\nAfraid I'd never be found\nI don't wanna go another round\nAn angry man's power will shut you up\nTrip wires fill this house with tip toed love\nRun out of excuses for everyone\nSo here I am and I will not run\nGuts over fear (the time is near)\nGuts over fear (I shed a tear)\nFor all the times I let you push me round\nAnd let you keep me down\nNow I got, guts over fear, guts over fear\n",
