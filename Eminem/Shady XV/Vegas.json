I'm blanking\nSomething about the balls between my legs and I think I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny\nWait I think I got it, okay bitch I got you, Robin Williams hanging\nLet's Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me\nCome on kemosabe\nIt's past time, like your favorite hobby\nCause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage\nAin't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer, or should I say Cobainer?\nThat she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit\nGot a wean her off it, weiner off it like she took my fucking penis, chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpits\nAnd she begun to swing a crumpet knife and paint the carpet, at least that's what her train of thought is\nCause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it, and made up a plane of bonkers\nAnd I always end up giving these bitches some complex\nAnd I don't mean apartment\nSo spread your feet apart\nAnd let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits\nNow grab this Cuisinart\nAnd make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite\nAnd that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch\nWalked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)\nSaid my names Booger, wanna catch a flick?\nI'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick\nBet you if you get this old dog these new tricks\nTo get familiar with I'll learn extra quick\nKick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit\nTook an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist\nBitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey\nHate Versace, Versace, I got M\u00fcnchhausen by proxy\nI'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me\nYou deaf, girl, I said you was foxy\nI'll tell a bitch like Bizarre\nBitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car\nAnd suck my fucking dick while I take a shit\nAnd I think with my dick so come blow my mind\nAnd it tastes like humble pie\nSo swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride\nIf I let you run alongside the Humvee\nUnless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's skeet\nSo what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy\nYou gon' blow that rape whistle on me\n(Scream!) I love it\n'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off\nLike this is our exit, now let's hit the highway and try not to get lost\n'Till we get to Las Vegas\n\n(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)\nVegas\n'Till we get to Las Vegas\n(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)\nVegas\n'Till we get to Las Vegas\n(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)\nVegas\n'Till we get to Las Vegas\n(Party, do it 'till tomorrow)\nVegas\n\nWhatever happens here, stays here\nSo let's go all the way dear\nTil we get to Las Vegas\n\nWhatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable\nTreat every women in my stable like flavors\nLooking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days\nIn 7 nights in the days Inn it's our Vegas\nWe roll in circles in packs... we the lifesavers\nShe got a boyfriend, I got a toy then\nI'll bring her with me when I show up to her crib waving\nAnd I ain't tryna be the nice neighbor\nI'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors\nAnd all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it\nNext ho froze and it look like I walked in to a jewelry store\nWith a about a million dollars with your mama\nAnd sat down n did the ALS challenge, haaaan\nI stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again\nAbout to get my back tatted again\nAbout to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand\nSitting on a bike in the sand\nIf you ain't been through nothing\nThen that shouldn't mean nothing to you like lice on a gram\nIf she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a Lam\nWeed got her so chinky eyed\nLook like she been getting high on a flight to Japan\nI keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking\nSound like I'm shaking up dice in a can\nListen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss\nIf this is my passion\nI learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence\nThe gift of my absence\nI don't know who you been listening to\nGot me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop\nBitch, I don't give a two shits\nBitch, get the fuck out of my face\nTo make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there\nAnd listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum\nEven though I have an affinity for witty banter\nStarting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer\nHold up, she misunderstood me\nI said take parvour four\nThought I said the wraith had four doors\nI knock a nigga face off\nGive him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...)\nI leave the club with my tab still open\nWon't even get a cab for you and your friend\nThe only fear I have is of loathing\nAnd I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas\n",
