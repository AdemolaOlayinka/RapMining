Go for broke\nHis cup just runneth over, oh no\nHe aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed\nTheyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know\nRap will never be the same as before\nBashing in the brains of these hoes\nAnd establishing a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited\nYou cant put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot\nYou dealin with a few true villains\nWhose stand inside of the booth truth spillin\nAnd spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths\nNow rewind it!\nPayback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?\nWhen I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place\nIm Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face\nYou aint gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place\nSo Drake\n\nIt may not mean nothing to yall\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I dont plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man\nIm shutting shit down at the mall\nAnd telling every girl she the one for me\nAnd I aint even planning to call\nI want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man\n",
