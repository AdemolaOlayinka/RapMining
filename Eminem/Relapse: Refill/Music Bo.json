Someone pinch me on the buns\nThe time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder\nI'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her\nAnd climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her\nwith the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her\nBut before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her\nGive her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha!\nI'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya\nSo strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula\nProlonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her\nDismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her\nZoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera\nStand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela\n",
