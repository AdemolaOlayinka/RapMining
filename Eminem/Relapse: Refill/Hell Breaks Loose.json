    "lyrics": "I want you to understand something\nThat when I come up in this bitch, I want the fans jumping\nI want them fists pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire\nBut I feel like a million bucks, Ladies won't you fill your cups?\nShady's come to fill you up, if you a D or a C-cup\nYou can even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E\nYou'll be in the E-R, we are strapped with so much T-N-T\nWe may blow, no, not even C-P-R from the EMT\nCan help you to resuscitate, You bustas must be flustered, wait\nYou can't cut the mustard, What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?\n(chk chk) What's my name? Shady came to crush the game\nInstantly, not even fair to them cause they pale in comparisons\nSo much they might as well wear a skin, don't you wish you could just share his pen?\nCause this shit is getting embarrassing, the fog is thick and the air is thin\nCause he won't even let them try to breathe, Dadidadidadadi\nHe makes it look so easy, Girl you just hit the lottery\n\nNow this would be the part of the song\nWhere they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose\nTry to restrain us, you can't contain us\nWe still gonna make it stick no matter what we do\nEverywhere we go, it seems we looking\nFor any excuse to just cut loose\nSo this would be the part of the song\nWhere they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose\n\nThis is when shit hits the fan like it just flat out don't stand\nThis is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers\nThen chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front\nSo do what we say and once it's over like a suance, it hums\n(It makes them stay in a trance, No choice, they have to dance)\nIt's like the playoffs, just making sure that we stay in the hunt\nTake a day off or what? Man, you better lay off the blunts\nYou must be smokin' something, think I ain't smokin' nothing, stay off my nuts\nNow hit the floor, baby, time to wipe away all the rust\nShake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose\nYeah, girl, shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse\nD-R-E is on the loose, I'm like a goose when it comes to the Chronic use\nYou know I can't stand to lose, Me and my goons are like animals\nWake up like a pack of wolves and we came here to extract the roof\nYeah, man, ain't that the truth? Girl, your mans is like in the booth\nDefinitely back up in this bitch, You swing? All hell breaks loose\n\nNow this would be the part of the song\nWhere they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose\nTry to restrain us, you can't contain us\nWe still gonna make it stick no matter what we do\nEverywhere we go, it seems we looking\nFor any excuse to just cut loose\nSo this would be the part of the song\nWhere they drop the needle on and hell breaks loose\n\nNow I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words\nI'm mur-durin the flow, liquid courage I'm fin' to blow\nAs soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe\nI'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go\nWe're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows\nFerocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe\nWith speakers knockin it's 3 o'clock, me and Doc then proceed to drop\n\"E\" and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'\n\nYeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow\nWe ain't bluffin for nothin, we'll knock the stuffin out you\nRevenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet\nYeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably\nPass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me\nBorn and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets\nThem haters hatin on me, but I refuse to lose any sleep\nKeep that deuce-deuce in the seat, Dre fall off that's news to me\n",
