You will never win\nSeverin, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb\nPull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident\n\n\n\n\nNow what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothin so chill\nFuckin whore you better fuckin hold still\nMake sure none of that, lotion in the bucket don't spill\nCut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffin those girls\nMan I think she had enough of those pills\nSedate her then I'll wait, I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel\nBlades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal\nI hate the loud noises, I fuckin told you!\nI keep hearin voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife\nAnd push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers\nInto her, barbecue her or would you do to her\nWhat you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?\n\"In a world of sin you are, this is turnin into a\nTorment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!\"\nI'll be sure to Ginsu ya 'til there's no more skin to ya\nBoo-yah, who ya think you're fuckin with; duck because here he comes again\n",
