    "lyrics": "These ideas are nightmares to white parents\nWhose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings\nLike whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows no swearing\nTo see him walking around with his headphones blaring\nAlone in his own zone, cold and he don't care\nHe's a problem child\nWhat bothers him all comes out, when he talks about\nHis fuckin' dad walkin' out\n'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out\nIf he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out\nHis thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back\nTalkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap\nHe sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap\nHis step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose\nHis house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions go...\n\n(C'mon), sing with me, (sing), sing for the years\n(Sing it), sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, (c'mon)\nSing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord'll take you away...\n\nEntertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters\nIn the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum\nHoly or unholy, only have one homie\nOnly this gun, lonely 'cause don't anyone know me\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a motherfucker they can be great\nOr they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\nLike they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\nTo havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass\nBut then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you\nFans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you\nTo get their hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind every time you mad\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\nThey're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete\nIt's all political, if my music is literal, and I'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl\nI couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...\n\n\nThey say music can alter moods and talk to you\nWell can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too\nWell if it can, then the next time you assault a dude\nJust tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued\nSee what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols\nAnd they want to get one 'cause they think the shit's cool\nNot knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers\nOf course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus\nBut music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our cheques in the mail\nIt's fucked up ain't it\nHow we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\nThat's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine\nWho post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long\nIdolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives\nTill they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die\nTill they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe\nWe're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes\nThat's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it\n'Cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone\nJust let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...\n",
