And look where it's at\nMiddle America, now it's a tragedy\nNow it's so sad to see, an upper class city\nHaving this happening (this happening)...\nThen attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)...\nBut I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire\nTo burn and it's burning and I have returned\n\nAnd I am, whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news everyday I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am, whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news everyday I am\nI don't know it's just the way I am\nI'm so sick and tired of being admired\nThat I wish that I would just die or get fired\nAnd dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables\nI'm not gonna be able to top on \"My Name is... \"\nAnd pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation\nThat got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations\nAnd I just do not got the patience (got the patience)...\nTo deal with these cocky Caucasians who think\nI'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk\nWith an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking\nThe same fucking questions (fucking questions)...\nWhat school did I go to, what hood I grew up in\nThe why, the who what when, the where, and the how\n'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out\n'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... I can't take it\nI'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit\nAnd I'm thankful for every fan that I get\nBut I can't take a shit, in the bathroom\nWithout someone standing by it\nNo, I won't sign your autograph\nYou can call me an asshole I'm glad\n\n'Cause I am, whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news everyday I am\nRadio won't even play my jam\n'Cause I am, whatever you say I am\nIf I wasn't, then why would I say I am?\nIn the paper, the news everyday I am\nI don't know, it's just the way I am\n",
