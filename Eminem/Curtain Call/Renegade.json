    "lyrics": "Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels(bling bling)\nDo you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?\nSee, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined\nThat same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing\nWhat I do, through and through and I gave you the news with a twist it's just his ghetto point of view\nThe renegade you been afraid\nI penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they\npop toasters, and they live with their mums\nGot dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggas crotched over\nMummy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over\nKnocked down by some clown when child support knocked\nNo, he's not around now how that sound to ya, jot it down\nI'll bring you through the ghetto without riding round\nhiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in their ways\nJust read a magazine that fucked up my day\nHow you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it?\nI help them see they way through it, not you.\nCan't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes\nBet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt.\n\nSince I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen\nI ain't no politician but I'll kick it within a minute\nCause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it\nBut if it don't, then ya'll swallow the truth grin and bear it\nNow who's the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics?\nWho could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics?\nUsing his music to steer it sharing his views and his merits\nBut there's a huge interference, they're saying, \"You shouldn't hear it.\"\nMaybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit\nMaybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish\nBut I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America\nas a motherfucking drug addict like you didn't experiment?\nNow now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror\nand see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed\nAnd I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents\nYou fucking do-gooders - too bad you couldn't DO-GOOD at marriage!\nAnd do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't\nthink you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo\nCause here we go, he's {Jigga durra Jigga da chk Jigga}\nAnd I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the..\n\nRENEGADE! Never been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk\nabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!\n\nNever been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a (RENEGADE) Never been afraid to holler\nabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING)\n\nI had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles\nPockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent\nGotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench\nWhat you hollering? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in\nBy the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver\nDoo-rag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope\nDo not step to me I'm awkward, I box leftier often\nMy pops left me and often my momma wasn't home\nCould not stress to me I wasn't growing, especially on nights\nI brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings\nMy demeanor thirty years my senior\nMy childhood didn't mean much, only raisin greener\nRaising my fingers to critics, raising my head to the sky\nBig I did it multi(i) before I die (nigga)\nNo lie, just know I chose my own fate\nI drove by the fork in the road and went straight.\n\nSee, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare\nJesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here\nTo shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me\nas a monger of hate, Satan and scatter-brained atheist\nBut that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste\nWe as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is\nOr is he the ladder, a gateway to escape?\nMedia scapegoat, they can be mad at today\nSee, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie\nwhile I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me\nGo to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics\nin holy water no wonder they try to hold me under longer\nI'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful\nThe new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you\nWhat did I do? (huh) I'm just a kid from the gutter\nmaking his butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a motherfucking\n\nRENEGADE! Never been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a RENEGADE! Never been afraid to talk\nabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING), RENEGADE!\n\nNever been afraid to say\nwhat's on my mind at, any given time of day\nCause I'm a (RENEGADE) Never been afraid to holler\nabout anything (ANYTHING) anything (ANYTHING)\n",
