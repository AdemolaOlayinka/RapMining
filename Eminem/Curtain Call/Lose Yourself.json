In one moment\nWould you capture it, or just let it slip?\nYo\nHis palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\nThere's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti\nHe's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs,\nBut he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down,\nThe whole crowd goes so loud\nHe opens his mouth, but the words won't come out\nHe's choking how, everybody's joking now\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!\nSnap back to reality. Oh, there goes gravity\nOh, there goes Rabbit, he choked\nHe's so mad, but he won't give up that\nEasy, no\nHe won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes\nIt don't matter, he's dope\nHe knows that but he's broke\nHe's so sad that he knows\nWhen he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's\nBack to the lab again, yo\nThis whole rhapsody\nHe better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\n\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment\nYou own it, you better never let it go (go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)\nYou better lose yourself in the music, the moment\nYou own it, you better never let it go (go)\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime (yo)\n(You better)\nThe soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping\nThis world is mine for the taking\nMake me king, as we move toward a new world order\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to postmortem\nIt only grows harder, homie grows hotter\nHe blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him\nCoast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter\nLonely roads, God only knows\nHe's grown farther from home, he's no father\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\nHis hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\nHe nose dove and sold nada\nSo the soap opera is told and unfolds\nI suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on\nDa da dum da dum da da da da\n\nNo more games, I'mma change what you call rage\nTear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged\nI was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\nBut I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher\nBest believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\nFact that I can't get by with my 9 to 5\nAnd I can't provide the right type of life for my family\n'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\nAnd it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder\nTrying to feed and water my seed, plus\nTeeter totter caught up between being a father and a primadonna\nBaby, mama drama's screaming on her\nToo much for me to wanna\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\nTo the point, I'm like a snail\nI've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot\nSuccess is my only motherfucking option, failure's not\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go\nI cannot grow old in Salem's lot\nSo here I go it's my shot.\nFeet, fail me not\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\n\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man\n",
