(Ha-ha!)\nFeminist women love Eminem\n\"Slim Shady, I'm sick of him\nLook at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what\nFlipping the you-know-who.\" \"Yeah, but he's so cute though!\"\nYeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose\nBut no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms\nSometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't\nBut it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose\n\"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips\"\nAnd if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss\nAnd that's the message that we deliver to little kids\nAnd expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is\nOf course they gonna know what intercourse is\nBy the time they hit fourth grade\nThey got the Discovery Channel, don't they?\n\"We ain't nothing but mammals..\" Well, some of us cannibals\nWho cut other people open like cantaloupes\nBut if we can hump dead animals and antelopes\nThen there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope\nBut if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote\nWomen wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes\n\n'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady\nAll you other Slim Shadys are just imitating\nSo won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,\nPlease stand up, please stand up?\n\nWill Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;\nWell I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!\nYou think I give a damn about a Grammy?\nHalf of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me\n\"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?\"\nWhy? So you guys could just lie to get me here?\nSo you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?\nYo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs\nSo I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst\nAnd hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\nLittle bitch, put me on blast on MTV\n\"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!\"\nI should download her audio on MP3\nAnd show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD\nI'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me\nSo I have been sent here to destroy you\nAnd there's a million of us just like me\nWho cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me\nWho dress like me; walk, talk and act like me\nIt just might be the next best thing but not quite me!\n\n\nI'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you\nThings you joke about with your friends inside your living room\nThe only difference is I got the balls to say it\nIn front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all\nI just get on the mic and spit it\nAnd whether you like to admit it I just shit it\nBetter than ninety percent of you rappers out can\nThen you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums\nIt's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty\nI'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting\nPinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens\nAnd I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working\nAnd every single person is a Slim Shady lurking\nHe could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings\nOr in the parking lot, circling\nScreaming \"I don't give a fuck!\"\nWith his windows down and his system up\nSo, will the real Shady please stand up?\nAnd put one of those fingers on each hand up?\nAnd be proud to be outta your mind and outta control\nAnd one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?\n\n\nHa ha\nGuess there's a Slim Shady in all of us\nFuck it, let's all stand up\n",
