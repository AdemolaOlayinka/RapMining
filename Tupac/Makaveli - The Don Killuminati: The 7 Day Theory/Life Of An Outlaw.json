    "lyrics": "In the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\n\nWhy explain the game\nNiggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions\nIf victims can't stand the heat then stay the fuck out the kitchen\nHalf these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean\nItchin', givin' suckers plenty space\nHave these bitch niggas snitchin'\nWhere are we now, guns found daily\nThe feds surely hope that they could finally nail me\nFor sellin' dope they backwards\nMake track burst, whenever I rap\nAttack\nWords bein' known to explode on contact\nExtreme at times\nBlinded by my passion and fury\nLook at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry\nYou'd stay silent if you niggas knew me\nTruely effective\nThe shit you heard ain't do me justice\nGot a death wish, bitch\nRun but face, being traced, by the infrared beam\nIt seems niggas ain't recognize my team\nAin't nobody holdin' you back, explode the track to confetti\nUnload it\nCause niggas ain't ready\nThe life of an outlaw\nIn the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\n\nCode 3\nAttack formation\nPull out your pistols\nKeep an eye out for the devils cause they itchin' to get you\nMerciless madman screamin' kamikaze in tongue\nAutomatic gunfire makin' all my enemies run\nWho should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'\nIndeed the possibility has part a chase in cream\nDope got me hatin' fiends\nScheme with my team, just a chosen few\nMy foes victim of explosives\nCome closer\nExhale the fumes\nWe got memories fadin' fast\nA slave for cash\nAccelerate, mash, blast, then dash\nDon't look now. How you like it, raw\nNiggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws\nNever surrender\nDeath before dishonor, stay free\nI'm thugged out\nFuck the world cause this is how they made me\nScarred but still breathin'\nBelieve in me and you could see the victory\nA warrior with jewels\nWill you picture me?\nLife of and outlaw\nIn the life we live as thugs (no doubt)\nEverybody fuckin' with us (yes!), so can't you see (life of an outlaw)\nIt's hard to be a man (soldiers in position, attack formation)\nRidin' with my guns in hand\n(No retreat, no surrender)\n\nCity under siege\nIt's like I can't even breathe\nI'm from the state of car thieves\nG, deep from the street\nPlenty beef\nI play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene\nMobb peep\nThis nigga from behind tryin' to creep\nNo half-wits, no straps, jack\nIt's on to bounce back\nAn ounce of wrath so bad,it snatched my style on death\nTell the reaper I was sent to get ya\nSnip with clippers\nGet the picture\nI wrote my life down as a scripture\n\nAnd still I'm lost in the land of the lonely\nWhere ain't nobody holy\nA matter of a fact, we unholy\nEverybody livin' soley for themselves\nToo high strung to lend help\nTo somebody who be needin' it\nYou know we lost hope and we needin' it\nWit' the evil it's forever\nBut it might be low down, scandalous\nLike a tramp is\nAll for the street fame on how to be managed\nTo plan shit\n6 months in advanced to what we plotted\nApproved to go on swole and now I got it\n\nUh, crack my window\nKnowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'\nAttach a strap under my pillow hand to hand like we freakin'\nCreepin' deep into mornin'\nPeepin' out the weak while they yawnin'\nAnd let my clout speak for itself\nNo doubt\nOutlaw\nOutta my mind, outta time\nYou're all blind\nSome kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind\nFindin' it funny, matter of fact, cause it is\nPerhaps finally I'll adapt to it over the years as an outlaw\n\n(Eh, Napoleon)\nWhat's up, nigga?\n(Would you die for me, nigga?)\nHell yeah\n(Would you kill for me, nigga?)\nOn my grandmother, nigga\n(Ah yo)\nWhat's up\n(Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now\nWatch out)\n\nWell, now they all say that vultures and parasites\nSnakes are all alike\nThug life break night\nDrink 'til we fist fight\nLife or death. But you can't win with a vest\nBut there won't be no breathin' for the reason\nPunk bitch on your breath\nI see day is dark and I admit it's dark\nSo chase the air hide your stash\nBeware from marks\nAnd yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly\nAnd let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty\nIn the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\nIn the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\nIn the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\nIn the life we live as thugs\nEverybody fuckin' with us so can't you see\nIt's hard to be a man\nRidin' with my guns in hand\n",
