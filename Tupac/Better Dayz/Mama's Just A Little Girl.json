    "lyrics": "Young mothers\nThat's right\nI feel ya (hey)\nI know how it is\n(MAMA's JUST A LIL' GIRL)\nDon't nobody understand\nI feel ya\n\n\n\nShe was ..\nBorn A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls\nA heart full of gold\nStill it won't change the world\nThough she could never understand why\nSome underhanded plans, witnessed a man die\nWas only 15\nShould have been a beauty queen\nStill see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed\nLittle girl don't cry\n'Coz even though they died\nYou can best believe they watching over thee from the sky\nNever asked for this misery\nBut look at what you gettin'\nIt's a blessing in disguise\nWhen you find out your pregnant\nNo money, no home\nAnd even though you all alone\nYou'se got to do this on your own\nSo baby go on\nI wish you luck\nAnd if you need me, call\nJust come to me and let me feed you all\nI can understand\nThe way it feels when you fighting the world\nFacing all this drama\nWhen mama's just A little girl\n\n\n\nMama\nDon't know why\nMama's just a little girl\nGiven that she's a ??\nTime ain't on her side\nMama's just a little girl\n(Mama's just a little girl)\nShe gotta hold her head up high\n\n\n\nAt 16 what a beautiful thing\nThe very essence of a jet black ebony queen\nAnd who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age\nShe didn't listen, had sex\nWatch her belly raise (hey)\nGot violated by someone she dated\nIf this is fate I hate to see the seed she created\nSo we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind\nShe reclines 9 months\nThen finally its time\nWhat do we find?\nA little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul\nAddicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage\nHe learned his values on the streets at an early age\nWatch for police\nDon't come home (why)\n'Coz mammas acting crazy\nAt the hospital\n'Bout to have another baby\nLike the rose from concrete\nGrown within\nBlessed with twins\nHow the hell can mamma raise 3 men\nSo we began a closest family\nSuch insanity\nA happy home\nFor one act inhumanity\nPlus mammas said the seed was corrupted\nUsed the rubber belly\nBegging us to breathe if she love us\nNow mamma sits quiet\nSipping peppermint schnapps\nTurned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)\nHow could mamma bring a thug like me into this world?\nShe ain't the cause of all the drama\nCause mommas just a little girl\n\n\n\nMama\nDon't know why\nMama's just a little girl\nLiven if she is or not\nTime ain't on her side\nCause ama's just a little girl\n(Mama's just a little girl)\nShe gotta hold her head up high\n(How could she raise us)\n\n\n\nNow\nWould she remain in the same spot?\nThe gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot\nNow look here\nI see her clutching her son\nIn her arms she hurt\nHer heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt\nFulfill prophecy\nBut who could stop the grief?\nI walk around trying to hold the world up on top me\nProbably be an innocent man\nBut still I'm the victim of a curse\nWhat could be worse?\nNothing but pain\nSince my birth, taught me functions at the pen\nCause everybody's in paying back society\nI'm guilty of a life of sin\nI watched the drama occur\nMy eyes blurred 'fore I jet it\nI wonder why we all have to die for we get it\nThough we shed tears\nSo many peers I done buried\nWorried and scared\nKnowing I'ma see the cemetery\nMust be prepared in this cold world\nNo-one cares\nNo it ain't fair\nBut we all there\nAnd do our share\nIn this land of underhanded schemes and plans\nVivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand\nMamma told me not to be a punk\nFuck what you talking about coward\nWhat you niggas want?\n\n(hey)\nThey ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world\nCause you know I ain't mad at cha\nYou' just a little girl\nSee mammas just a little girl\n(hey hey)\n\n\n\n\n\nMama\ndon't know why\nMama's just a little girl\nGiven that she is or not\ntime ain't on here side\nmama's just a little girl\n(mama's just a little girl)\nshe gotta hold her head up high\n\n\n\nThey ask us why we mutilate each other like we do\nAnd wonder why we hold such little worth for human life\nFacing all this drama\nBut to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse\nIs to ignore from which we came\nYou see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals\nOn the contrary\nWe would all celebrate its tenacity\nWe would all love its will to reach the sun\nWell\nWe are the roses (echo)\nThis is the concrete (echo)\nAnd these are my damaged petals (echo)\nDon't ask me why (echo)\nThank god nigga (echo)\nAsk me how (echo)\n(hahaha)\n\nYou see, mama's just a little girl\n",
