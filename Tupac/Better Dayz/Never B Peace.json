    "lyrics": "Now of course I want peace on the streets\nBut realistically\nPainting perfect pictures ain't never work\nMy misery was so deep\nCouldn't sleep through all my pressures\nIn my quest for cash\nI learned fast\nUsing violent measures\nMemories of adolescent years\nTheir was unity\nBut after puberty we brought war\nTo our community\nSo many bodies dropping\nIts gotta stop\nI want to help\nBut still I'm stepping\nKeeping my weapon\nMust protect myself\nThe promise of a better tomorrow\nain't never reach me\nPlus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me\nSipping thunderbird\nAnd grape kool-aid\nCalling Earl since my stomach was empty\nIt seduced me to fuck the world\nWatch my 'lil homies\nLose there childhood to guns\nNobody cries no more\nCause we all die for fun\nSo why you ask me if I want peace\nIf you cant grant it\nNiggas fighting across the whole planet\nSo we can never be peace\n\n\n\nWill there ever be peace?\nOr all we all just headed for doom,\nStill consumed by the beefs,\nAnd I know there never be peace,\nThat's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets\nCause there can never be peace\n\n\n\nSomebody owes me\nWill they control me?, nah\nI ain't a hater playa\nBut I want all you got\nYour babies have babies\nNow we fighting each other\nMy dogs got rabies\nThey biting each other\n'n' it ain't hard to find a friend like mine\nBig fully is a bully\nAnd he don't mind dying\nAnd I gotta be bright\nMiss sign after sign\nTime after time\nAfter time after time\nAnd I don't like nobody\nThey don't like me more\nAnd I'm cool with that finally\nBut they heard it before\nDog\nWe living in a prison\nLosing our religion on em\nThanks given when thankful just for living in hell\nDamn homey I don't mean to be harsh\nBut it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart\nAnd if we make it up out\nWe still stuck in the dark\nWill there ever be peace?\nJust the peace in my heart\nNever\n\n\nThe only peace we got\nIs the peace in our heart\nOr the peace in our mind\nRight there in piece that we hold in our waste line\nFeel me dog?\nCm'on\n\n\n\nWill there ever be peace?\nOr all we all just headed for doom,\nStill consumed by the beefs,\nAnd I know there never be peace, (never)\nThats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets\n'Coz there can never be peace\n\n\n\nThings are changing\nNigga you better fantasize\nI'm only concerned about me and mine in these times\nThe world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it\nWe all goin' need God if we plan to get out of this\nNiggas spending too much time hating on each other\nNiggas buyin' guns\nLoad em up\nAim at each other\nAnd the victim is you and me\nThe secret is true indeed\nThe good die\nMostly over bullshit\nRepeatedly\nDeep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love\nBut the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us\nSo I stays ready\nKeep my pay heavy and boss up\nStack my funds and my guns\nNever rely on luck\nAsking God to point out the imposters\nNever let no weapon formed against me prosper\nCause they'll never be peace\nSo don't rely on it\nSoldiers die for\nAnd in the ghetto, they trying for it\nFUCK PEACE\n\n\n\nWill there ever be peace?\nOr all we all just headed for doom,\nStill consumed by the beefs,\nAnd I know there never be peace,\nThat's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets\nCause there can never be peace\n\n\n\nShit, fuck peace\nOn the strength till my niggas get a piece\nWe cant have peace\nHow the fuck we gonna live happy if we ain't got none?\nYou motherfuckers is smiling, but I'm mean mugging\nWhy? Cause gotta be thugging\nI've seen drugs done turned this motherfucking hood out\nAll us niggas acting up\nWild ass motherfucking adolescents\nThese niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more\nHow the fuck can you have a childhood and you have a funeral every motherfucking weekend\nAnd you motherfuckers talking about peace?\nNigga, it ain't no motherfucking peace\nYou ain't seen the news motherfucker?\nYou ain't heard?\nLittle babies getting smoked\nMotherfuckers killing there whole family\n'Lil kids getting thrown off buildings\nMotherfuckers gettin abused\nPeace? Niggas you out your motherfucking mind?\nFuck peace\nWe can't never have peace, till you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made\n'Till u fucking clean up the dirt u dropped\n'Till we get a piece\nFuck peace\nWestside\n",
