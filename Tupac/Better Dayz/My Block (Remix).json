Heh\nF'real on my motherfucking block\n\n\nThey got a nigga\nShedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears\nCause shit was hectic for me last year\nIt appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath\nThe underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed\nAnd no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary\nfor all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery\nShit is scary, how black on black crime legendary\nBut at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried\nTeardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic\nAnd certain death for us ghetto bastards\nWhat can we do when we're arrested, but open fire\nLife in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die\nBut don't cry through your despair\nI wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare\nAnd who cares if we survive\nThe only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutching on a four-five\nMy neighborhood ain't the same\nCause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game\nAnd I swear it's like a trap\nBut I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back\nHoes show me love, niggas give me props\nForever hop cause it don't stop... on my block\n\n\nLiving life is but a dream\nHard times is all we see (on my block)\nEvery block is kinda mean\nBut on our block we still prayyyyyy\nBut on our block we still prayyyyyy...\n\n\nNow shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots\nCan't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops\nBlack male slipping in hail when will we prevail\nFearing jail but crack sales got me living well\nAnd the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life\nStaying strapped forever trapped in this drug life\nGod help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job\nSo I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard\nCan't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt\nPut in work and shed tears for my dead peers\nMislead from childhood where I went astray\nTill this day I still pray for a better way\nCan't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke\nFrom the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark\nCouldn't quit the bullshit make me represent\nHit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went\nIn my heart, I felt alone out here on my own\nI close my eyes and picture home... on my block\n\n\n\n\nAnd I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die\nCaught strays from AK's and the driveby\nSwollen pride and homicide, don't coincide\nBrothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside\nCause our block is filled with danger\nUsed to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers\nTime changes us to stone them crack pipes\nAll up and down the block exterminating black life\nBut I can't blame the dealers\nMy mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels\nShit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy\nA single mother with a problem child, daddy free\nHanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor\nGamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her\nIt's a man's world, staying strapped\nFantasies of a nigga living phat, but held back\nPipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless\nWide eyed and losing focus... on my block\n\n\n\n\nAnd block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight\nA young nigga learned to break night\nUsed to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen\nI send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind\nI see the same motherfuckers balling\nAlcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call\nI know the young niggas understand this\nGrowing up in this world where everything is scandalous\nI reminisce on the fast times, past crimes\nTrying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime\nCan't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game\nGold chains, some extra change, and the street fame\nAnd what's strange is everybody knows my name, swear they all know me\nAnd lots of cash make a nigga change\nI hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain\nFor all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block\n\n\n\n\nRest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away\nFrom all the blocks that I'm from\nOne-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin?\n183rd and Walt, my block, that's right\n122nd and Morningside, my block, that's right\nDecatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that's right\nIn the jungle of Marin City, that's my block, that's right\nLos Angeles, haha, that's my block too\nOakland, can't forget Oaktown, that's my block for sure\nAnd all the other blocks around this motherfucker\nHouston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago\nAll y'all niggas stay kicking up dust\nRepresent the motherfucking block\n",
