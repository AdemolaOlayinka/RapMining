(Huhuhu)\nThe cases of a drug dealer\nReal thugs, where you at?\nYo a motherfucking army\nDo it to them\nDo it to them\nThey love the way we do it to them\nWe do it to them\nCalvary\n\n\n\nSuppress the revolution of premeditated scheme\nIntroduce a drug called crack\nTo us ghetto teens\nGot a law for raw niggas now\nPlaya what it be like?\nWhen will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes\nCan't seem to focus\nHopeless\nWith violent thoughts\nI wrote this\nGot these devils petrified\nHiding from my hocus pocus\nAnd so I learned to earn my currency\nAnd over time\nAffiliated\nClearly click a military mind\nMay god forgive us\nThough we dwell inside a paradox\nThugged out and drug dealing\n>From the womb to the block\nMy live mind got me surviving 5 shots\nMy 45 got me fortified with live rounds\nWhen shit stick\nWe plot hits\nWhen our block spits\nAll hail\nOut on bail\nWrath of 2pacalypse\nForever ghetto\nNecessary picture food stamps\nOutlaw thug niggas\nNever left the boot camp\n\n\n\nI'm a nigga for assignment\nOne of the suqads finest\nSkilled in gorilla warfare\nAnd blessed\nWork with firearm\nMy rap shit\nContains sections of bomb sessions\nSays I'm responsible for black smith and wessons\nPutting up on ?? in the military state of mind\nDangerous like chronic and yard when combined\nCocoa Brovas pan the borderline\nThat's the sound and your dead son\n\nMan to man\nI'm facing the devil with a plan\nJudo stance\nFirst glance\nI'm making my advance\nAnimal instincts\nIntelligence of an assassin\nMask my ninja style\nSurround me ready to attack\nI react swiftly\nWhat father taught me sticks with me\nNever forget the methods stick and move strictly\nShit be seeming like its closing in\nWith no regrets I hold position\nCause I circles\nI'm one of the chosen men\n\nPicture being put in position to move\nAnd you can't move\nCause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock\nThat's when the madness beings\nSo I start to focusing\nMy thoughts on the war\nCause the rule is the law\nAnd the law that we live by is to stay true to self\nIn this case beady eye\nWhy try\nEverybody lie\nAbout the block\nTrue soldier mentality\nThis is how we rock and move\n\nStick and move\nTime to show what kinda nigga\nMove or get moved on\nLets see whos strong\n\nIn the days of the strange\nWhere nothing stays the same\nWith new faces come through with similar game\nAnd who you thought them\nReally ain't they (echo)\nCatching deja vu\nOf the game people play\nIt's a call for re-adjustment\nFine tune your positions\nYou slipping and tripping\nInstead of bobbing and dipping\nWill never let this world of stress get me\nTaking breathing techniques\nSlay you with tai chi\n\nWhat did you change\nTo get a break\nIn the world of snakes\nAnd those who fake\nElimination I'm facing\nDestruction\nOutlaw till I duck down\nFrom po po's bustin'\nNo one to trust in\nRushing to the goal line\nCatch a nigga\nBeat him\nTreat him like he stole mine\nNo swine\nI'm a soldier\nTold cha I control mine\nTime to take you back into time\nFollow this here\n\nOne way out\nThis black hole\nFor this black soul\nShit is outta control\nI'm fighting for my position\nTo be a fetus in this world I am entering\nAnd my face is sentencing for repentance\nBefore my body was fully formed into a human\nI was already consuming weed\nCause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's\nMaybe that's why in the 90's\nI drop g's when I drop degrees\nWhen I ease across the block\nWith Pac\nAnd got all you niggas shot\nYou didn't think\nBoot Camp click would link\nWith the outlaw minded\nIf you do you press rewind\nAnd you can peep gorilla tactics in every line\n\n\n\nYeah\nAnd this is how we do it\nWhere my real thugs?\nWhere they at?\nLet me see my real thugs\nWhere you at\nWont you see my real thugs\nWhere you at\nLet me see my real thugs\nWhere u at\nNow\nWhere my real thugs\nLet me see where you at\nTell me where my real thugs\nGots to see where you at\nWhere's my soldiers\nWhere you at\nWhere's my real soldiers\nWhere you at\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere you at\nWhere you at\nGet your strap my nigga\nWhere you at?\nWhere you at?\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere you at?\nWhere you at?\nHit your thug niggas\nWhere you at?\nWith your strap\nWhere my soldiers at\nWith my true thug niggas\nNo longer drug dealers\nCause we now thug niggas\nWhere my soldiers at?\nNo longer drug dealers\nCause we now thug niggas\nLet me\nWhere my\nWhere my soldiers at\nPut your pistols in the air\nWhere my soldiers at\nPut your guns up\nTell me where my soldiers at\nPut your pistols in the air\nWhere my, soldiers\nMy true thug rollers\nYes\nIt just doesn't quit\nYes\nThis is that real hip hop shit\nYes\nFuck what you heard\nFrom the ghetto to the 'burbs\nKnow we meant every word\nWhere my soldiers\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere my soldiers\nWhere my soldiers at\nPut your hand on your pistol\nPoint your pistols in the air\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere my soldiers\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhere my soldiers\nWhere my soldiers at\nWhen Bob Dole and Deloris Tucker wanna know, where my soldiers at\nCode Fo'\n",
