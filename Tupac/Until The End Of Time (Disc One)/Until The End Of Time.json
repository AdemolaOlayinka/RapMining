    "lyrics": "Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side\nSomewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die\nAnd even though we both came from the same places\nThe money and the fame made us all change places\nHow could it be through the misery that came to pass\nThe hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency\nBut you could run to me when you need me, I'll never leave\nI just needed someone to believe in, as you can see\nIt's a small thing through and true\nWhat could I do? Real homies help ya get through,\nAnd coming new, he'd do the same thing if he could\nCause in the hood true homies make you feel good\nAnd half the time we be acting up call the cops\nBringing the cease to the peace that was on my block\nIt never stop, when my mama ask me will I change\nI tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same\nUntil the end of time\n\nSo take, these broken wings\nI need your hands to come and heal me once again\n(Until the end of time)\nSo I can fly away, until the end of time\nUntil the end of time\nUntil the end of time\n\nPlease Lord forgive me for my life of sin\nMy hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids\nSo you know I don't hang around the house much\nThis all night money making got me outta touch, shit\nAin't flashed a smile in a long while\nAn unexpected birth worst of the ghetto child\nMy attitude got me walking solo\nRide out alone in my low-low\nWatching the whole world move in slow-mo\nFor quiet times disappear listen to the ocean\nSmoking Ports think my thoughts\nThen it's back to coasting\nWho can I trust in this cold world\nMy phony homey had a baby by my own girl\nBut I ain't tripping I'm a player I ain't sweating him\nI sexed his sister, had her mumbling like a Mexican\nHis next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen\nBesides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping\nUntil the end of time\n\n\nNow who's to say if I was right or wrong?\nTo live my life as an outlaw all along\nRemain strong in this planet full of player haters\nThey conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators\nAnd in the end drinking Hennessy made all my enemies envy me\nSo cold when I flow eliminating easily\nFall to their knees, they plead for their right to breathe\nWhile begging me to keep the peace (ha ha)\nWell I can see close into achieve\nIn times of danger don't freeze time to be a g\nFollow my lead I supply everything you need\nAn ounce of game and the training to make a g\nRemember me, as an outcast outlaw\nAnother album out that's what I'm about, more\nGetting raw till the day I see my casket\nBuried as a g while the whole world remembers me\nUntil the end of time\n\nIf an angel comes down\nAnd takes me away\nThe memories of me\nAnd my songs\nWill always stay\nTill they can find\n(until the end of time)\nUntil the end of time\nTill the end of time\n",
