Cause bein black hurts\nAnd even worse if you speak first\nLivin my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?\nCause maybe if I tried to change\nWho I'm kiddin? I'ma thug 'til I die, I'ma rider mayne\nTouch bases, eat lunch at plush places\nRegular criminal oasis awaits us\nIf there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there\nAnd I'm sorry for not bein there\nJust know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world\nBless the boys, and all my little girls\nTo the Lord I'm eternal, restin in peace\nPlease take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child\n\n\n\n\nTo my unborn child.. please take of all my kids\nMy unborn child.. to my unborn child\nThis letter goes out to.. to the seeds that I might not get to see\ncause of this lifestyle\nJust know that your daddy loves you, got nuttin but love for you\nAll I wanted was for you have a better life than I did\nThat's why I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind\nWhen you get to be my age you'll understand\nJust know I got love for you\nAnd I'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven\nCause ghetto heaven gotta be there.. haha, take care\nRun wild, but be smart\nFollow the rules of the game\nI know that sometimes it's confusin\nThe rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday\nWatch out for these snakes and fakes, friends comin down the way..\n",
