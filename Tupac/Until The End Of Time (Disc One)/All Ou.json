To my real niggaz stuck in the street game\nCause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins\nIs it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor\nAnd watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door\nI ride or die, but these other fag niggaz be bitin this\nIt's all from my heart when I was writin this\nAll out\n\n\n\n\nNow, we all ride, and down to die who wit us\nSpeak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us\nAin't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough\nTattooed up, and now them niggaz swearin they Pac\nStop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha\nThese glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha\nIt's me, Kastro with the goattee\nWalkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me\nI pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy\nFrontline soulja, till the heavens call me\nI go all out, and if you real, you real\nFeel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill\nI live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it\nLivin' proof, Pac breed niggaz, they can't deal wit'\nHolla back, right back, and watch ya mouth\nOr get blood in it, WHAT, we goin' all out\nNigga\n\n\n\nfool, you better go all out\nkeep goin' all out\nall my niggaz goin' all out\nwithout a muthafuckin' doubt\n\n\nEy, you niggaz just gon think that you gon be uhh\ntalkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records\nand we ain't gon say shit, now it's 1999\nIt's a different grind, don't disrespect the Don\nIt's still war motherfuckers\nSo let's see you act like you know\n",
