Cook some yay-yo.\nHollar \"one-time\" when I say so.\nDon't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.\nNarcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.\nAnd they say how do you survive weighin' 165\nIn a city where the skinny niggas die?\nTell Mama don't cry.\nEven when they kill me,\nThey can never take the game from a young G.\nI'm st8 ballin'!\n\nSt8 ballin'!\n\nStill on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'\npour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.\nBut if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.\nIt's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'.\nDressin' down like a villian', but only on the block.\nIt's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.\nHa, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.\nI'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.\nI hit the strip let my music bump,\nDrinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.\nRather die makin' money than live poor and legal\nAs I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.\nA need money in a major way.\nTime to fuck my BEACH! Hey! And gettin' paid\nYou other motherfuckers callin',\nBut me and my motherfucking thug niggas,\nWe st8 ballin'!!\n\nSt8 ballin'!\n\nDamned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.\nSo watch a young motherfucker pull a trigger just to RAISE UP!\nBut don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes\nYoung nigga time to do or die.\nI keep a pistol in my pocket,\nReady on my block.\nAin't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.\nAnd now they see that motherfucker beat pain,\nAt point blank range 'cause he slept on the game.\nAin't a damned thing changed\nShakin' the dice, now roll 'em,\nIf you can't stand pain better hold 'em.\n'Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.\nYou might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.\nBetter live your life to the fullest,\nYou're 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol motherfucker better pull it.\n'Cause even when they kill me,\nthey can never take the game from a young G.\nWe st8 ballin'!\n\nWe st8 ballin'!\n\nTo my niggas in the penitentiary,\nLocked up like a motherfucker when they mention me.\n'Cause you're fuckin' with the realest motherfucker ever born,\nAnd once again it's on,\nI'm bustin' on these bitches till they're gone.\nWho the hell can you get to stop me?\nI'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.\nI keep my glock cocked\nI need it 'cause they're all shady.\nI finally made it\nnow these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!\nI ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.\nI'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.\nAnd I came up a long way from food stamps.\nAnd takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.\nCould you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire?\nWhat could I do? Pull my trigger or watch my nigga die.\nI'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.\nI'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.\nAnd motherfucker, we be ballin'!\nAll motherfucking day long, stay strong!\nWe st8 ballin'.\n",
