Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)\n(\"What you doing, man?\")\nThey tried to frame me\nThey tried to say I had some dope in the back seat\nBut I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend\nMy homie panicked (\"I'm out!\") he tried to run\n(Freeze, nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun\nMy homie dropped, so I hit the cop\nI kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop\nBefore I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless\nThe other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless\n(Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)\nNow I'm against this cop who was racist\nGivin' him a taste of trading places\nAnd all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this frame up,\nBut I came up\nNow they claimin' that I'm violent\n\"They claimin' that I'm violent.\"\n\"Fuck the damn cop!\"\n\"Just because we play what the people want.\"\n\nAs I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-oh)\nThen the gun shot, but I wasn't hit\nI turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand\nHe shot the cop (damn!). Now he's a dead man\nI said, come on, it's time for us to get away\n(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)\nThey called for backup, and they'll be on their way\nJumped in the car and tried to get away quick\nThe car wouldn't start (damn!). We in deep shit\nSo we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)\nWe drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far\nBut I looked up and all I saw was blue lights\n(that's a lotta of one time)\nIf I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight\nI grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge\n(yeah, it's on now)\nLoad 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray\nWe'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons\nAnd when we through sprayin' then we steppin'\nThis is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops\nYou fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped\nSo here we go, the police against us\nDark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust\n(What's next, man?) What's next? I don't know and I don't care\nOne thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here\nBut if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me\n(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me\nYou wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent\nGivin' them a reason to claim that I'm violent\n\"They claimin' that I'm violent.\"\n\"Fuck the damn cop!\"\n\"Just because we play what the people want.\"\n",
