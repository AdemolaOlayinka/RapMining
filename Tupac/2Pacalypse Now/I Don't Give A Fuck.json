How much shit can a nigga take?\nI ain't going nowhere no how\nBush wanna throw down?\nBetter bring the gun, pal\n'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay\nFuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK\nAnd even if they shoot me down\nThere'll be another nigga bigger from the mothafuckin' underground\nSo step but you better step quick\n'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit\nYou're watching the makings of a psychopath\nBut you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath\nWho's that behind the trigger?\nWho do you think? A mothafucking 90's nigga\nReady to buck and rip shit up, I had enough!\nYeah, and i just don't give a fuck\n\nNigga, it ain't just the blacks\nIt's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks\nThey say niggas hang in packs and they attitudes is shitty\nSo tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?\nThey say we niggas like to do niggas\nSo me an' a cop are just two niggas\nA street-walking nigga and a beat-walking nigga\nWith a badge, I end his future and his past\nWith a blast take his cash before I dash I bash his head in\nDump him at the dead end and that's just his luck\n'Cause a nigga like P, don't really give a fuck\n\nWalked in the store, what's everybody staring at?\nThey act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black\nFollowing a nigga and shit \u2013 ain't this a bitch?\nAll I wanted was some chips\nI wanna take my business elsewhere \u2013 but where?\n'Cause who in the hell cares\nAbout a black man with a black need?\nThey wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend\nI wonder if he knows that my income\nIs more than his pension, salary and then some\nYour daughter is my number one fan\nAnd your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man\nSo who's the mack, in fact who's the black Jack?\nSit back and get fat off the fat cat\nWhile he thinks that he's getting over\nI bust a move as smooth as Casanova\nAnd count another quick mill'\nI'm getting paid for my trade but I'm still real\nAnd if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme\nAs strong as a fucking nine\nMail stacked up, niggas wanna act up\nLet's put the gats up and throw your blacks up\nBut the cops getting dropped by the gun shot\nUsed to come but he's done, now we run the block\nTo my brothers \u2014 stay strong, keep your heads up\nThey know we fed up; but they just don't give a fuck\nThey just don't give a fuck\n\nI gotta give my fuck offs\nFuck you to the San Francisco police department\nFuck you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department\nFuck you to the FBI\nFuck you to the CIA\nFuck you to the B-u-s-h\nFuck you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka\nFuck you to all you redneck prejudice motherfuckers\nThat wanna fuck with me, fuck y'all!\nPunk gay sensitive little dick bastards\n2Pacalypse motherfuckerin' now\nY'all can all kiss my ass and suck my dick\nAnd my uncle Tommy's balls\nFuck y'all\nPunks\n",
