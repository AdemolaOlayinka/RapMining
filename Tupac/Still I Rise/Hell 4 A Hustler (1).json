Gettin blowed out\nHigh, watch me murder the bird, before he testify\nStrikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life\nAnd if you dream be a part of my team\nFrom Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends\nKeep yo' eyes on the prize, ni**a watch for bustaz\nEither heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler\n\n\n\n\nThis is how we ride\nNot knowin if we'll live or die\nCatch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side\nIn case of drama, I'm the first to break wild til they all die\nThis is how we ride\nNot knowin if we'll live or die\nCatch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side\nIn case of drama, I'm the first to break wild\nuntil they all die, Outlaw\nYes (change my ways) yes\nThe Black Jesuz guide us through this\nWeary weary weary weary\n\nOnly God can save us\nNuttin but boss players\nOutlawz and thugs\n",
