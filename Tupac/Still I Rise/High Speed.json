    "lyrics": "I speak\nFor all my ni**az livin' in the rush\nSlow it down just a notch baby\nIt's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright\n\n\nLife in High Speed\nf**k the punishment, tie weed\nI gonna buy me a gun\nf**k doin' time\n\n\nI live life High Speed\nSlightly disillusioned by weed\nI breed thug muthaf**kas even worse than me\nWhen I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me\nMy army, ni**az decieve swiftly\nLook at you now, why you wanna hang out?\nI pull the hammer back\nStrike wit' a cannon and blow your muthaf**kin' back out\nThey blast but I'm still standin'\nSlightly scarred deep\nQuestions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul\nThough my life was hard with no remorse\nI absorb bomb less provide protection for the boss\nRollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless\nKeep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless\nAnd my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews\nWe all about our past, blast if he break the rules\nFools done snitched for the D.A., be heavensent\nSwitched like a stone-bi**h, turned str8 severed then, why?\nThen they wonder why ni**az die\nPut your family in danger just to get high\nNow, what the hell can we get from jail?\nMore tricks for the crime rate, this is hell\nBail out, a thug ni**a fresh out the jailhouse\nOpen your safe count and take all your mail out\nWhatever happens happens\nWhoever falls dies\nWe fresh out of time, livin blind, so we all ride\nIn times like these, chronic and tie weed\nPuffin' through these High Speedz\nAnd people say\n\n\n\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\nI'm gonna buy me a gun\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\nI'm gonna buy me a gun\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\n\n\nVerbal a*sa*sin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'\nI plan to stretch your chest plate back like elastic\nNo need to push me to slippin'\nI love beef, like pussy and pistols\nFor all you pussies that's soft as tissue\nI ride plottin' like the fall guy out the roof\nBustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof\nGettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine\nGet that a*s attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind\nGrab your shots', callin'\nCatchin ni**az while they stormin'\nKickin' his door in\nAnd get your whole f**kin' family a' mournin'\nPlus all you itchy-bi**hy types can't touch me\nFrontin' like your hard\nI'll play your f**kin' yard like a trussel\n\n\n\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\nI'm gonna buy me a gun\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\nI'm gonna buy me a gun\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\n\n\nAt times, I look through times wit' so much anger\nWonderin' why it keeps on pa*sin' bringin' me the danger\nNo singal hard time is a good one\nAt times I'm amazed\nNow what the mutha f**k a hood done\nWhat we do to get paid\nAll day, for the almighty, dollar\nDon't even bother to holla\nWe all destined to be swallowed\nBy the same thing we lust for\nThrew away our morals in bags of dust, more\nni**az is dying tommorrow\nWe, bet on all time\nni**a the clocks tickin'\nApproachin' is the day you only know your glocks spittin\nCops sittin', politicians pa*sin' laws you ain't knowin'\nSoon that money goin' be illegal when you got it\nKeep your dough up\nBut I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper\nMan, I'm just like ya'll, I worry 'bout that s**t later\nPut the metal to the pedal, slash up ni**a, blaze\nLets get blowed out High Speed til the end of my dayz\nNow my people say\n\n\n\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\nI'm gonna buy me a gun\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\n\n\nHigh Speedz (we goin' all night)\nLife of an Outlaw, ghetto starz (we goin' all night)\n(Yes) I'm gonna buy me a gun\nWhatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nFor my ni**az on the WestSide and the EastSide\nAnd the NorthSide and the SouthSide\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\n(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)\nFrom Compton to Jersey\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nGettin' it real hard\nni**az in Michigan, (M.O.B ni**a, M.O.B)\nFrom Atlanta, Georgia to Utah\n(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)\nFrom St. Louis to Alabama\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nFrom Mississippi to Oakland, from San Francisco to San Diego\nSeattle to Florida\n(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)\nMaine to Ma*s, haha\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nFood and Sex\n(Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nThen what's next?\nFood and Sex, house parties in the projects\nWe goin' all night\nHigh Speedz\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(We goin' all night)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(We goin' all night)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(We goin' all night)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\n(I'm gonna buy me a gun)\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\nAnd it don't stop, and it won't quit\nOutlawz with that rough s**t, baby!\n\n\nLearn about it\nPac you goin' rap?\n",
