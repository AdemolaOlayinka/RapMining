    "lyrics": "Dear Lord\nAs we down here, struggle for as long as we know\nIn search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)\nDreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go\nThe only place for us\nI know, try to make the best of bad situations\nSeems to be my life's story\nAin't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain\nAnd can't nobody live this life for me\nIt's a ride you all, a long hard ride\n\n\nSomebody wake me I'm dreaming, I started as a seed the semen\nSwimming upstream, planted in the womb while screaming\non the top, was my pops, my momma screaming stop\nFrom a single drop, this is what they got\nNot to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser\nOnly plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her\nEven as a little seed, I could see his plan for me\nStranded on welfare, another broken family\nNow what was I to be, a product of this heated passion\nMomma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass\nLook how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me\nPistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me\nHow can I survive? Got me asking white Jesus\nwill a nigga live or die, 'cause the Lord can't see us\nin the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine\nNo sunny days and we only play sometimes\nWhen everybody's sleeping\nI open my window jump to the streets and get to creeping\nI can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone\nI'm only 19, I'm trying to hustle on my own\non the spot where everybody and they pops trying to slang rocks\nI'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops\nDon't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn\nYou can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone\nYou can ask my man he's a mind reader\nKeep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind\nMeet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga\nThat Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga\nEverywhere I go niggaz holla at me, \"Keep it real G\"\nAnd my reply till they kill me\nAct up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did\nThe tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise\n\n\nStill I (still I) I rise (I rise)\nPlease give me to the sky (the sky)\nAnd if (and if) I die (I die)\nI don't want you to cry\n\n\nI stay sharp as always\nRunning ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways\nDumping crews like two's, nigga all day\nSecrets of war prepare me for the worst\nA life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse\nBut now my dreams it seeems though, be placing triple beams and things bro\nDiamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans\n\n\nNow I plan to keep my glock cocked\nIf trouble was searchin for me then why not?\nShow em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block\nChancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatching bags\nWe out for power, making cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad\nI'm just like, pimping\nMy homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in\nYoungest they bucking somethin the life he leads\nthe life he don't need, don't we all know\nHe trying to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise\n\n\nDreams of lost hope\nI hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke\nand still I rise now I float cowards ghost\nWhenever we come around, I'm running down\nclutching a pound, live as sirens, ducking the sound\nI used to hustle with my moms till the sun came\nMy homey Harm doing time from this drug game\nStolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw\nBehind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars\nFreedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block\nCrackheads only ten learn to duck cops\n\n\nIn ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blasting bastards\nNo faces for open caskets, peeling ya cap backwards\nYa cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice\nI send my missiles through your mattress\nLeaving holes in your body like a cactus\nWhile me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic\nand loot to keep the seams in my motherfucking jeans poppin\nLeaving ya spleen to pick up\nHalf of you niggaz is softer than a Snicker\nLet's go to war and see who draw quicker\nand still I rise, and still I rise...\n\n\nStill I (still I) I rise (I rise)\nPlease give me to the sky (the sky)\nAnd if (and if) I die (I die)\nI don't want you to cry\n\nStill I (still I) I rise (I rise)\nPlease give me to the sky (the sky)\nAnd if (and if) I die (I die)\nI don't want you to cry\n\n\nYou all niggaz fake\nAll day everyday\nSo now I got roller blades, bitch\nThought you knew\nYour mouth is rich\nC'mon pops, let's go..\n",
