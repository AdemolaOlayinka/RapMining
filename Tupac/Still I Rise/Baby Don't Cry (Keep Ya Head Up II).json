(baby don't)\nbut you can't, you can't give up\n{Hey.. 2Pac what?}\n\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {Outlawz}\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {Keep ya head up}\n\nNow here's a story bout a woman with dreams\nSo picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen\nBeneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile\nNobody knew about her secret so it took a while\nI could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek\nSheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,\n\"What would you do if it was you?\"\nCouldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through\nI tried to trade places in the tragedy\nI couldn't picture three crazed ni**az grabbin me\nFor just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me\nFour ni**az violated, they chased and they raped me\nEven though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief\nThinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go\nNo! You got to find a way to survive\ncause they win when your soul dies\n\nBaby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {never give up}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry\n\nUhh\nForget him girl (forget him girl) he ain't gon' never change\nain't no hater but that ni**a lost in the game\nAfter the bright lights and big thangs\nhe probably could love you, but he in love with the struggle\nEveryday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin mo')\nand never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'\nUh oh (uh oh), now you bout to have his baby? (dayamn)\nAnother wild-a*s ni**a that's gon' drive you crazy\nYou got too much, mo', livin to do - I'm spittin this to you,\ncause you deserve more than what he givin to you (that's right)\nBeautiful, black, precious, and complicated\nA new millennium dime piece, so fine she\ngot em all stuck standin still when she come through\nBaby take a little mo' time, love'll find you\nAnd show us the sky's blue somebody other than me\ngon' give you everything you need, feel me?\n{Don't cry-ahhhhh..}\n\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {keep your head up}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {no no.. ohhhh}\nBaby don't cry\n\nI'm tryin to do all that I can, from jump\nNow you losin, you was choosin the wrong man\nDealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful\nLost and turned out, what you let that ni**a do to you? (Damn)\nI knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me\nWrote me a note in crayon, wantin to get with me\nWe was kids, now she got three kids\nThey see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is\nSeen him last night, homey roll a E-cla*s\nMad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad\nI bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through\nbut those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really I could do (nah)\nI feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife\nSeventeen with three kids, locked down for life\nShoulda chose me, she bout to O.D. from the pressure\nHell nah I won't let her {BABY DON'T CRY}\n\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {you'll be alright}\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {baby don't cry}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {baby baby baby}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {no..}\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {no-ohhhh}\nBaby don't cry, I gotta keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, you got to keep your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up {ooooh baby}\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {keep your head up}\n{keep your head up, never give up}\nEven when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry\n\nUhh, uhh, yeah, don't give up {you'll be alright}\nDon't cry, don't cry, don't cry\n\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up\nBaby don't cry, I hope you got your head up\nEven when the road is hard, never give up, baby don't cry\n\nFor all the ladies {Soulshock, Karlin}\nBaby don't cry\nGot to keep your head up {keep your head up}\nMakaveli the Don {head up} aight?\n",
