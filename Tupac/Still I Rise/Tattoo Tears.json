It could never happen\nAt least not while I'm walkin and rappin\nHeard of some ni**az on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me\n(Throw ya hands up, hands up)\nThey can't hide, listen to the rough s**t, my click\n(Throw ya motherf**kin hands up)\n\nI said many times busters still can't see\nY'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)\nI been, handlin stress in this s**t for years\nBlazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I\nsaid many times busters still can't see\nY'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)\nI been, handlin stress in this s**t for years\nBlazed out sheddin tattooed tears\n\nNow, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy\nDon't want to hurt a soul ni**a, so don't make me\nI got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes\nMy enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through\nBut that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll\nnever be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets\nEven on the other side brothers die, but ride\nni**az get high off a slow form of suicide\nHide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties\nI live my life to f**kin mo', exposin tragically\nHow can we find some peace and ni**az still ain't get a piece\nI know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat\nI'm seeing Satin infiltratin; my military mind\nmake me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin\nForgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through\nto become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears\n\n\n\nI said many times busters still can't see\nY'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)\nI been, handlin stress in this s**t for years\nBlazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I\nsaid many times busters still can't see\nY'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)\nI been, handlin stress in this s**t for years\nBlazed out sheddin tattooed tears\n\nThugged out baby!\n\n\nWe don't shed tears we shed blood\nDo you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?\nWe don't shed tears we shed blood\nDo you still wanna be a thug?\n\nYo, criminal ways of thinkin made me crave Abe Lincolns\nThe days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends\nSeeking a better path, expose a better half of me\nBlast for me, the task after me\nFor a few years sheddin tattooed tears\nlike Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family\nWe scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time\nOutlawz locked down for some past crimes\nFast dimes made my stash grow smaller\nYour block ain't no harder, fake baller\n\n\nni**a it's like this\nI been thuggin just for the cause of it\nOut to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and s**t\nAnd it's all for the pressure\nthat'll make me cock my s**t up off the dresser\nMade ni**a mafia of course my ni**as gonna test ya\nAnswers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson\nStill stucked up in a f**k session, Jersey where the ni**az flexin\nPo-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by\nWet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye\nNow mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die\nSo ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life\nfor the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin\nBlazed out sheddin tattoed tears\n\n\n\n\ns**t.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die\nSeein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin high\nas life replays like time; underhanded schemes\nto get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime\nMy enemies want me squeezed\nThey get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees\nPlease beware we thugs revolution size\nCriminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize\nLocked down, got many shell shocked, now\nHoldin down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style\n\n\nYo I been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late\nVisions of killers en ma*se at the blast mayne\nAs I lay here gatted down and tatted\nKnowin now it's hard to slow down for a addict\nIt's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers\nBeefin and never even, ain't no love in the air\nAnd I suffer my s**t in hell, talkin to the heavens\nWalkin thru the valley of death with my fellas\nI lost a lot, startin with hope I tried\nAnd for every tattoo I got a moment I cried\nI'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain\nStep in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain\nI'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear\nAin't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears\nCome on...\n",
