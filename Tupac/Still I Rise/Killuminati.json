Amin, until the law come for me\nKill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati\n\n\nThey got me thinkin strugglin and hustling's my only fate\nToppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin to keep that money straight\nTimes is rollin three up these streets sleep\nBut when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets\nMy life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts\nGot a package from the devil, payin my deeds\nPreocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead\nMore funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze\nMe and my thugs clock G's simpin naughty thangs\nReal as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati\n\n\n\n\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nHold it down, hold it down\nMakaveli up in this bi**h, worldwide mash, Westside\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nThe question we ask, do you know what time it is?\nHold it down, hold it down\nYou know what type of s**t we be\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nYou want that hip-hop real\nIt's that hip-hop that's real\nHold it down, hold it down\nHip-hop that's worldwide, feel?\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nf**k with me ni**a you get killed!\nHold it down, hold it down\nIt don't get no realer than this\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nWhat's my motherf**kin name ni**a?\nHold it down, hold it down\nMy ni**az we all bad\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nWhat's my muh'f**kin name ni**a?\nHold it down, hold it down\nWhat's my muh'f**kin name?\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nOutlawz in this bi**h\nRap pro at his finest\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain\nRepeat! Death Row at it's finest\nni**a, you know what time it is\nMakaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain..\nOutlawz..\n",
