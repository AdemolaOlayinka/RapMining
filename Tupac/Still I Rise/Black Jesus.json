Black Jesus\n\n\nAll hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail\nSome missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail\nIn times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops\nlike a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through\nBlack Jesus, hahahahaha\nHe's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through\nBlack Jesus\n\n\nOutlawz we got our own race, culture, religion\nRebellin against the system, commence to lynchin\nThe President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth\nWe make music for eternity, forever the truth\nPolitical prisoner, the two choices that they givin us\nRide or die, for life they sentence us\nOh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn\nSoon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm\nBrothers gone, now labeled a statistic\nAin't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets\nHistory repeats itself, nuttin new\nIn school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true\nBlack Jesus\n\n\nTo this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated\nAn Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded\nMade for terror, major league ni**az pray together\nbi**hes in they grave while my real ni**az play together\nWe die clutchin gla*ses, filled with liquor bomblastic\nCreamated, last wishes ni**a smoke my ashes\nHigh sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities\nI'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily\nCops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them\nI was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison\nWent to church but don't understand it, they underhanded\nGod gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous\nBlast til they holy high; baptize they evil minds\nWise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick\nWhich one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?\nbi**hes freeze facin Black Jesus\n\n\nAll hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail\nSome missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail\nIn times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops\nlike a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through\nBlack Jesus\n\n\nSome say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail\nAnd it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell\nTrapped, black, scarred and barred\nSearching for truth, where it's hard to find God\nI play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer\nProceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes\nMy Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me\nWhere we, so used to hard times and casualties\nIndeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets\nAnd haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me\nAnd all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns\nBlazed out and numb, slaves to this slums\nThis ain't livin... Jesus\n\n\nWe believed in you\nEverything you do\nJust wanna let you know, how we feel\nBlack Jesus!\n\nSearchin for Black Jesus\nIt's hard, it's hard\nWe need help out here\nSo we searchins for Black Jesus\nIt's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through\nSomebody that understand our pain\nYou know maybe not too perfect, you know\nSomebody that hurt like we hurt\nSomebody that smoke like we smoke\nDrink like we drink\nThat understand where we coming from\nThat's who we pray to\nWe need help y'all\n",
