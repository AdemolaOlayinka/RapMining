    "lyrics": "I shall not fear no man but God\nThough I walk through the valley of death\nI shed so many tears\nIf I should die before I wake\nPlease God walk with me\nGrab a nigga and take me to Heaven\nBack in elementary, I thrived on misery\nLeft me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed\nInside my mind couldn't find a place to rest\nUntil I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest\nTell me can you feel me\nI'm not living in the past, you wanna last?\nBe the first to blast Remember Kato\nNo longer with us; he's deceased\nCall on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace\nIs there heaven for a G? Remember me\nSo many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears\nI! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...\nLord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears\nNow that I'm struggling in this business, by any means\nLabel me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen\nAnd fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions\nOf leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?\nTake me away from all the pressure and all the pain\nShow me some happiness again, I'm going blind\nI spend my time in this cell, ain't living well\nI know my destiny is Hell. Where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears\nLord! I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...\nLord! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears\nNow I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears\nI'm suicidal so don't stand near me\nMy every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer\nTo embrace an early death, now there's nothing left\nThere was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest\nI'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace\nAnd though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it\nI had my mind full of demons trying to break free\nThey planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame\nInside my brain like a match, such a dirty game\nNo memories, just a misery\nPainting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep\nWill I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun\nPlease Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come\nLord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...\nGod! I lost so many peers\nAnd Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide\nSeen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die\nWonder why as I walk by\nBroken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high\nThis ain't the life for me, I wanna change\nBut ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game\nI'm trapped inside a maze\nSee this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy\nDisillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies\nSo I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady\nDon't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison\nI'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more\nI'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in\nTo Heaven's door -- shed so many tears\nLord! lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...\nI lost so many peers, and shed so many tears...\nLord! I suffered many years, and shed so many tears...\nGod! I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears\n",
