Step up (Game's been good to me)\nCan yi know I'm serving up blood claat\nPlaying yi fucking games\nOoh, we take game, we won!\n(I don't care what it did to them)\nAny by now\n(the game's been good to me)\nAll, yi haffa forget fi we won!\nEverytime\n\nI'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth\nHad to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse\nHeaded for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse\nMy only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt\nMy decisions do or die, been hustlin' since junior high\nNo time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine\nPut away my nine, cause these times call for four-five shells\nCause life is hell, and everybody dies\nWhat about these niggas I despise\nThem loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives\nShoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize\nFollow the rules or follow them fools that die\nEverybody's tryin' to make the news\nNiggas confused, quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues\nIf you choose to apply yourself\nGo with the grain then, come into riches and the bitches and the fame\nHeavy in the game\n\n(Game's been good to me)\nBoy, ya nah bitch!\nMajor that's true we look good everytime\nWhen we at Beers Diamond\nAnd 2Pac drives vintage car (Game's been good to me)\nAnd fi them frame them look good, oh no?\nThis whole world ya call on\nGonna mass on a face\nFor any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!\n(I don't care what it did to them)\n( the game's been good to me)\nFlush it! Oh!\nNobody wan come test me ya know\nTrue them we a drive pretty car\nWanna no part of any ting\nAnd now you wan come drown a gun\nBut ya see we know, you haffa show I'm maximum respect\nFor when a blood clat run or when a pussy walk up\nWe look good everytime\n'Nough dollars, dollars!\nYa know about dollars, them right?\nBut we nah talk no shit\nWe haffa walk de walk for we a talk, see it?\n'Cause action, action speak louder dan words\nYou n who the record partner\nDon't blood claat ting at, ALL\n",
