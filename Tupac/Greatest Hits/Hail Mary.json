Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!\n\nCome with me!\nHail Mary, nigga, run quick, see\nWhat do we have here now?\nDo you wanna ride or die?\nLa la-la-la la la la la\n\nI ain't a killer, but don't push me\nRevenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy\nPicture paragraphs unloaded, wise words being quoted\nPeeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it\nBow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'\nSeein' niggas comin' for me\nThrough my diamonds, when they glistenin'\nNow pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost\nIn these killing fields, hail Mary, catch me if I go\nLet's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman\nScreams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee\nActivate my hate, let it break to the flame\nSet trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim\nSome say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit\nStuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit\nPlus, mama told me never stop until I bust a nut\nFuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, hail Mary\n\nCome with me!\nHail Mary, nigga, run quick, see\nWhat do we have here now?\nDo you wanna ride or die?\nLa la-la-la la la la la\n\nPenitentiaries is packed with promise-makers\nNever realize the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'\nInstitutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble\nBut too hardened for a smile\nWe're too crazy to be humble; we ballin'\nCatch me, father, please, \u2018cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store\nPass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?\nHell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared\nMama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there\nI got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?\nOne life to live, but I got nothin' to lose\nJust me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs\nWe all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs\nTo my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid\nRaise hell to this real shit and feel this\nWhen they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark\nThuggin' eternal through my heart; now hail Mary, nigga!\n\nCome with me!\nHail Mary, nigga, run quick, see\nWhat do we have here now?\nDo you wanna ride or die?\nLa la-la-la la la la la\n\nThey got a APB out on my thug family\nSince Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks\nOur enemies die now, walk around half dead\nHead down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai chronic\nMixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high\nVisions of me, thug-livin', gettin' me by\nForever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs\nWhen I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs\n\nPeep the whole scene and whatever's going on around me\nBrain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy\nReady to wet the party up\nAnd whoever in that mothafucka, nasty new street slugger\nMy heat seeks suckers on the regular\nMashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra\nCocked back, 60 seconds 'til the draw\nThat's when I'm deadin' ya, feet first\nYou've got a nice gat, but my heat's worse\nFrom a thug to preachin' church\nI gave you love, now you eatin' dirt\nNeedin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on\n\u2018Cause word is bond\nWhen I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn\nThat's when the sun came up, there's only one way up\nHold your head and stay up\nTo all my niggas, get your pay and weight up\n\nIf it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks\nOutlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?\nTo this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take\nDealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate\nIf it's on, then it's on, we rape break beat-breaks\nOutlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?\nTo this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take\nDealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate\n\nCome with me!\nHail Mary, nigga, run quick, see\nWhat do we have here now?\nDo you wanna ride or die?\nLa la-la-la la la la la\n\nWe've been travelin' on this weary road\nSometimes life can be a heavy load\nBut we ride, ride it like a bullet\nHail Mary, hail Mary\nWe won't worry, everything will curry\nFree like the bird in the tree\nWe won't worry, everything will curry\nYes, we free like the bird in the tree\nWe runnin' from the penitentiary\nThis is the time for we liberty; hail Mary, hail Mary!\n\nWestside, Outlawz\nMakaveli the Don, solo\nKilluminati, The 7 Days\n",
