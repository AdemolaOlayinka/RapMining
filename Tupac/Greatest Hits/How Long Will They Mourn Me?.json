This for my nigga Kato\nIt's still on nigga\nThug Life, Thugs for life\nHa Ha yeah, how long will they mourn me\nYeah nigga\n2Pac in this muthafucka\n\n\n\nAll my homies drinking liquor\nTears in everybody's eyes\nNiggas cried to mourn a homies homicide\nBut I can't cry\ninstead I'm just a shoulder\nDamn, why they take another soldier\nI load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry\nI'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)\nRetaliate and pull a 187\ndo real niggas get to go to heaven ?\nHow long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'\nBitch don't wanna die\nthen don't fuck with me\nIt's kinda hard to be optimistic\nWhen your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted\nY'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends\nBut I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn)\nThey should've shot me when I was born\nNow I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm\nHow long will they mourn me ?\n\n\n\nI wish it would have been another\nHow long will they mourn me\nHow long will they mourn my brother\n(Got them niggas all dead and shit)\nHow long will they mourn me\nI wish it would have been another\n(Nate Dogg)\nHow long will they mourn me\nHow long will they mourn my brother\n(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)\n\n\n\nHow long will they mourn me\nEvery muthafuckin' day homie\nYou stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me\nFrom my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga\nAnd things won't be the same without ya nigga\nI remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack\nAnd goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack\nSmokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'\nHung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'\nTell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?\nSo confused not knowing which way to go\nI'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time\nI can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind\nSo day after day\nride after ride\nWe'll hook up on the other side\nWatch over your family and your newborn\nTill we meet again homie\nHow long will they mourn me ?\n\n\n\nI wish it would have been another\n(Yo Kato)\nHow long will they mourn me\n(It's still on nigga)\nHow long will they mourn my brother\nHow long will they mourn me\nI wish it would have been another\n(Yeah)\nHow long will they mourn me\nHow long will they mourn my brother\n(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)\n\n\n\nDamn a nigga tired of feeling sad\nI'm tired of putting in work\nI'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth\nI know soon one day I'll be in the dirt\nAnd my peoples'll be mournin'\nWhen they get a call from the coroner\nAll niggas can say is that's fucked up\nAnd get tossed up\nReminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)\nRest and love to my nigga Kato\nSee you in the crossroads real soon\nFor now let me pour out some brew\nI'll be always thinkin' of ya homie\nRest in peace\nHow long will they mourn me ?\n\nYa know life's a fuckin' trip\nAnd everybody gotta go\nBut why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato\nAnother nigga fell victim to the chrome\nIt's enough to make you crazy\nIt's fuckin' with my dome\nYa only live once on this earth\nA nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth\nBut niggas say they down and they always be my homie\nBut when a nigga gone\nHow long will ya mourn me ?\n\n\n\nYeah!\nI wish it would have been another\n(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)\nYeah, how long will ya mourn me\nHow long will ya mourn my bother\n(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit,\nNate Dogg do that shit nigga)\nI wish it would have been another\nYeah! How long will ya mourn me\nHow long will ya mourn my brother\n(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)\nHow long will ya mourn me\nI wish it would have been another\nHow long will ya mourn my brother\n",
