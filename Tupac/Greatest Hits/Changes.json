    "lyrics": "Come on come on\nI see no changes. Wake up in the morning and I ask myself,\n\"Is life worth living? Should I blast myself?\"\nI'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black.\nMy stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch.\nCops give a damn about a negro? Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero.\nGive the crack to the kids who the hell cares? One less hungry mouth on the welfare.\nFirst ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers.\nGive 'em guns, step back, and watch 'em kill each other.\n\"It's time to fight back\", that's what Huey said.\n2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead.\nI got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere\nunless we share with each other. We gotta start makin' changes.\nLearn to see me as a brother 'stead of 2 distant strangers.\nAnd that's how it's supposed to be.\nHow can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?\nI'd love to go back to when we played as kids\nbut things changed, and that's the way it is\n\nCome on come on\nThat's just the way it is\nThings'll never be the same\nThat's just the way it is\naww yeah\n\nI see no changes. All I see is racist faces.\nMisplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under.\nI wonder what it takes to make this one better place...\nlet's erase the wasted.\nTake the evil out the people, they'll be acting right.\n'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight.\nAnd only time we chill is when we kill each other.\nIt takes skill to be real, time to heal each other.\nAnd although it seems heaven sent,\nwe ain't ready to see a black President, uhh.\nIt ain't a secret don't conceal the fact...\nthe penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks.\nBut some things will never change.\nTry to show another way, but they stayin' in the dope game.\nNow tell me what's a mother to do?\nBein' real don't appeal to the brother in you.\nYou gotta operate the easy way.\n\"I made a G today\" But you made it in a sleazy way.\nSellin' crack to the kids. \"I gotta get paid,\"\nWell hey, well that's the way it is.\n\n\nWe gotta make a change...\nIt's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.\nLet's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live\nand let's change the way we treat each other.\nYou see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do\nwhat we gotta do, to survive.\nAnd still I see no changes. Can't a brother get a little peace?\nThere's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.\nInstead of war on poverty,\nthey got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.\nAnd I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do.\nBut now I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you.\nDon't let 'em jack you up, back you up, crack you up and pimp smack you up.\nYou gotta learn to hold ya own.\nThey get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone.\nBut tell the cops they can't touch this.\nI don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this.\nThat's the sound of my tool. You say it ain't cool, but mama didn't raise no fool.\nAnd as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped and I never get to lay back.\n'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback.\nSome buck that I roughed up way back... comin' back after all these years.\nRat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat. That's the way it is. uhh\n\nSome things will never change\n",
