Rest, nigga, cause I ain't worried\nEyes blurry saying goodbye at the cemetery\nThough memories fade\nI got your name tatted on my arm\nSo we both ball till my dying days\nBefore I say goodbye\nKato and Mental rest in peace. Thug till I die!\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G\nBe a lie if I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nRest in peace, young nigga, there's a Heaven for a G\nBe a lie if I told you that I never thought of death\nMy niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on\nBury me smiling with G's in my pocket\nHave a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it\nLet the hoes that I used to know\nFrom way before kiss me from my head to my toe\nGive me a paper and a pen so I can write about my life of sin\nA couple bottles of gin in case I don't get in\nTell all my people I'm a Ridah\nNobody cries when we die, we outlaws, let me ride\nUntil I get free, I live my life in the fast lane\nGot police chasing me\nTo my niggas from old blocks, from old crews\nNiggas that guided me through back in the old school\nPour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies\nSee, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me\nAnd brothers, miss ya while your gone\nYou left your nigga on his own. How long we mourn?\nLife goes on\nHow many brothers fell victim to the streets?\nLife goes on homie\nGone on, cause they passed away\nNiggas doing life, niggas doing 50 and 60 years and shit\nI feel ya, nigga. Trust me, I feel ya\nYou know what I mean\nLast year we poured out liquor for ya\nThis year nigga, life goes on\nWe're gonna clock now\nGet money, evade bitches, evade tricks, give playa haters plenty of space, and basically just represent for you baby\nNext time you see your niggas, you're gonna be on top, nigga\nThey're gonna be like, \"Goddamn, them niggas came up\"\nThat's right, baby, life goes on and we up out this bitch\nHey Kato, Mental\nY'all niggas make sure it's poppin' when we get up there man\nDon't front\nLife goes on\nHold me no more hold me no more\nYes it do yes it do yes it do\n",
