    "lyrics": "When thugs cry..\nNow I lay me down to sleep\nI pray the Lord my guns to keep\nIf I die before I wake\nI pray the Lord my soul to take\nGod as my witness, when thugs cry, too much is hard\n\n\nBorn thuggin and lovin the way I came up\nBig money clutchin, bustin while evadin cocaine busts\nMy pulse rushin, send my pulse into insanity\nShout at my cousin now we bustin if they yo' family\nThe coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried\nI got a line on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin his secretary\nI black out and start cussin, bust 'em and touch 'em all\nThey panic and bitches duckin, I rush 'em and fuck 'em all\nI'll probably be an old man before I understand\nwhy I had to live my life with pistols close at hand\nKidnapped my homey's sister, cut her face up bad\nThey even raped so we blazed they pad\nAutomatic shots rang out, on every block\nThey puttin hits out on politicians, even cops, I ain't lyin\nThey got me sleepin with my infrared beams\nAnd in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin\nWhat is the meaning, when thugs cry?\n\n\nOh why, children send your child off to die\nIn the streets of chalk where they lie\nLet no wrongs cry out when thugs cry\nDear God..\nOh why, does it have to be this way, our\nchildren of today won't stay wise\nLet the children hear when thugs cry\nDear God.. oh why..\n\n\n\n\n\nHeh.. maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin\nWhere is the love? Never quit my ambition to thug\nAin't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary\nNiggaz I used to love, enclosed in penitentiaries\nBut still homey keep it real, how does it feel\nto lose your life, over somethin that you did as a kid?\nYou all alone, no communication, block on the phone\nDon't get along with yo' pop, and plus your moms is gone\nWhere did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song\nto help us grow at times, but now our minds are gone\nWe went from brothers and sisters, to niggaz and bitches\nWe went from welfare livin, to worldwide riches\nBut somethin changed in this dirty game, everything's strange\nLost all my homies over cocaine.. mayne\nSee they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie\nSee you gotta get high or die, cause even thugs cry\n\n\n\n\nAnd all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures\nBustin motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures\nCause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don\nI write your name on a piece of paper, now your family's gone\nWhy perpetrate like you can handle my team?\nSo merciless that my attack'll take command of your dreams\nLeavin motherfuckers drownin in they own blood\nClownin takin pictures later\nLaugh bout the punk bitches, that turned snitches\nRegulate my area, the terror I represent\nMakin yo' people disappear, you wonderin where they went?\nAm I cold or is it just I sold my soul?\nAddicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told\nCome take my body God, don't let me suffer any longer\nSmoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long\nWhere is the end to all my misery, is there a close?\nI suppose that's why I murder my foes, when thugs cry\n\n\n\n\nI shed tattooed tears for years\nfor my dead homeboys and my prison peers\nY'all ain't never heard my cries\nNow you wonder why would you die?\n",
