Westside in this motherfucker


Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swerving
Packed in a suburban, screaming outlaw running on the curb
They never try me 'cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin in the back of the club, trading convo
Living like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinking champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas player hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doing eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Getting high, wonder why we gotta die smoking
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spending my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw


Am I wrong, wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor or
Puffin on a sweet swisher I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it going on
Last to leave until I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor or
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left


I got my back against the wall
Gat chilling by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear
better strap down to the feelins 'cause we out yeah
Thug passion all up in me
Feeling like I took some Henne
It ain't easy I'm trying to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got with these rap niggas
Wanna pull they're gat niggas
Only got my side 'cause they think pac die nigga
Last niggas with our tape
Take a shot within our vest
Pac come and catch weight
Nigga we the last ones left


If we would've known the zone inside my own dome
Fresh outs jail it was hell but I'm probably home
Looking for niggas that was roofing that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when its cocked back
Fuck 'em all they're bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak
We're the last ones left



Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybody's gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor or
Puffin on a sweet swisher like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong, wanna get it going on
Last to leave till I see everybody's gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor or
Puffin on a sweet swisher, last one left
Am I wrong, wanna get it going on
Last to leave till I see everybody's gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor of (Yeah)
Puffin on a sweet swisher, I'm the last one left


I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth
Me and my team super supreme putting in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, till it hurt
And I call earl screaming fuck the world
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wify even wanna know if she's gonna see me tonight
And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got
And that's until I see Yak
And that's until I see Pac
Young know I lost a troll somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl I'd stick my dick in the ground
Fuck the world
