    "lyrics": "Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya\nGive a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners\nI remember drinkin Hennesey, smokin weed\nFantasize about the things we'd grow to be\nHad a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank\nSmoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank\nShooting craps in the alley til they chased us off\nPour a little for my homies but don't waste it all\nOooohweee, who popped that coochie best?\nOn my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest\nHaving house parties in a crowded spot\nAnd you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot\nEverybody wanna dance when the slow jam come\nLookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump\nStraight grindin, everybody havin fun\nAnd it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun\nCause another dude kicked his Bacardi over\nHe had to act a fool now the party's over\nGun shots rang like it's thunder\nAnd everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number\nSays she got a man but she's lying\nWhy? I seen her talking to this other guy and..\nhe's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him\nI ain't trippin I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love\n\nAin't got nuttin but love for ya\nI'm down for yours, nuttin but love\n\nI love to go back, to the block I got my game from\nAnd pay respect to the place that I came from.\nCause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin\nHe'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin\nBut I can't diss him he's my elder\nHe been livin here longer what that tell ya?\nAnd little girls playin double dutch\nStill blush, cause she don't get in trouble much\nIt's uhh, ponytails and barrettes\nI gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set\nAnd little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all\nGet out the street before they hit y'all\nAnd as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss\nAnd wonder how we came to this\nI help an old lady across the street, the cost is free\nI can't take what she offers me\nAnd this is how the world could be\nThis is how the world should be\nFeels good to be back on the streets\nCause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love\n\nWhen I was young I used to want to be a dealer see\nCause the gold and cars they appealed to me\nI saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks\nAnd the square's getting big for these sack of dope\nStarted thinking bout a plan to get paid myself\nSo I made myself, raised myself\nTil the dealer on the block told me, \"That ain't cool\nYou ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool\"\nI got my game about women from a prostitute\nAnd way back used to rap on the block for loot\nI tryed to make my way legit, haha\nBut it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent\nAnd uhh, it was funny how I copped out\nI couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out\nMy family on welfare\nI'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care\nI'm out here on my own\nAt least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone\nI'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face\nCause my life is filled with hate\nUntil I looked around me\nI saw nothing but family, straight up down for me\nPanthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs\nHey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love\n\nOaktown -- ain't got nuttin but love for ya\nain't got nuttin but love for ya\n",
