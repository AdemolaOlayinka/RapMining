Hahaha, here we go\nIt's ninety-fo', what's next?\nPower enter my world\nI guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggas\nI swear these playa haters done got a taste of power\nIt ain't all good in the hood\nLeast not on my side, from where I stand\nAnd the law? Man, fuck the law!\nNiggas must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart\nThe motherfuckin' law, in every way\nKey word in ninety-four is 'down low'\nGots to be struggling\nI see how the rich got theirs\nNigga I'm legit, shit\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nWho's afraid, of the punk police?\nTo my niggas run the streets, fuck peace\nHey niggas, where your heart at?\nSee motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas\nKillin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin' mark\nNow what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race\nbefore he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?\nThese crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns\nJails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs\nAnd they wonder why we loc'n up\nWhere do we go from here?\nWhere do we go?\n\nAll you niggas out there\nThe clouds shook, the world listened\nWe stood together in April of ninety-two\nWith duty, and a sense of honor\nThere is no limit to what WE can achieve\nThat's all on us... us...\nNot my niggas, not the whites, not the enemies\nor none of them motherfuckers, US\nWhat can WE do? Shit\nI declare a death sentence to all child molesters\nFake-ass bitches, male and female\nAnd all you punk-ass snitches\nWe can do without your asshole\nLet no man break, what we set\nWhere do we go from here?\nRest in peace, to Kato, I miss you\nAll the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three\nIn ninety-four, and more\nWhat do we do? For us?\n",
