I just saw him runnin around the other day.\nAhh, fuck that fool. But anyway, what's happenin with my moms?\nShe gave me a message for you:\nShe said she's sorry she couldn't be here today, but she'll be here next week.\nAwright well check this out, I got somethin real important\nI want you to tell her\nC'mon c'mon this shit's over with.\n\nI'm not done talking to him!\n\nC'mon boy, back to your cell.\nShut that shit up bitch! He's outta here, c'mon.\n\nDon't be callin my woman no bitch! I'll fuck you up!\n\nYeah yeah fool, what? Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool.\nYou institutionalized, and this is your home...\n\nGuess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two\nCause me and the crew could still get our rocks off\nThe penetentiary don't stop a nigga cause he's in jail\nHell I'm makin more money on the street from here in a cell\nI'm livin proper, the coppers is havin fits\nI just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin shit\nI still remember my momma told me\nFind the cop who killed your brother\nsend him to Hell lookin homely\nCause a real nigga love the law\nWhat's raw is a nigga that's above the law\nKeep pressin your luck and get fucked, huh\nThink a nigga don't know whassup cause he's locked up\nBut in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time\nConcentrate on gettin green time\nAnd as the years go by, they forgot\nabout the small time soldier from the block, huh\nTo kill the crook they threw the book at me\nDon't worry be nappy, don't even look happy\nPut me in the hole, gave me cold cuts\nDid push-ups until I swoll up\nAnd then they offer me a furlough\nBut what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin five mo'\nThey asked me if I changed much\nI told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut\nThey started askin my questions about my brother\nAnd makin remarks about my mother, hmm\nWait a minute, hold up\nMakin jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up\nThey sent me back to the hole for what I told em\nI guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him\nHe went home to find a tragedy\nNigga, that's what you get for tryin to badger me\nAnd anybody else that wanna sweat me\nI'm already in jail so you punks can't get me\nYou better pray they never see me\nCause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets.\nWhen I get free\n",
