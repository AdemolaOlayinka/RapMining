Yo K, anyway\nThese motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day\nSo I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine\nAnd I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime) <yeah nigga>\nAnd I squeeze when I say I'm coming\nStraight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting\n(Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggas is fronting\nDo you really want it? niggas dying...)\n\n\n\nDon't make enemies with me\nI try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see\nDon't make enemies with me\nYou'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs\nDon't make enemies with me\nI try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see\nDon't make enemies with me\nYou'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs\nDon't make enemies with me\n\n\n\nNow, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'\nCup? in a flash sittin on that ass (And rarely fold)\nGalitter tell 'em bout that trife shit (You wanna fight?\nI wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch) bee-yatch!\nA nigga struggle too hard for what I got\nhustle (And doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop\nHell nah! I coulnd't see it\nFacing a century in the penatentury but so be it)\nAnd Jesus couldn't help me out the state\n(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate\nBut wait) No time for stalling (But death is calling)\nYou wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling\n(True, what I do from sun up) is for a come up\n(Wake up with my gun up) Cause when I sneak that's when they run up\n(So It's time to spray like Ray\nAnd put the freeze on these fake Gs) You know how we do\n\n\n\nDon't make enemies with me <haha>\nI try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see\nDon't make enemies with me\nYou'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs\nDon't make enemies with me, nigga\nI try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see\nDon't make enemies with me\nYou'd Rather fuck with these other other little Gs\nDon't make enemies with me\n\nWhat nigga? Young motherfucking thugs, let's out do it\nDon't make enemies with me nigga\nY'all better fuck with these other niggas\nAnd I don't see it\nDon't make enemies with me\nMotherfuckers is fatal nigga\nI swear by the Gods\nDon't make enemies with me nigga\nNiggas gonna see they caskets fucking with these bastards\nDon't make enemies with me\nIt's for all these motherfuckers that's swearing to God\nThat they be doing something\nDon't make enemies with me\nThat they touching something\nThat they being something\nY'all niggas ain't shit\nThat's on my mama bring the drama, nigga\nYoung Thugs, fuck the drugs\nThese niggas making records, y'all niggas best to check it\nCause y'all gonna get yo asshole tore\nThey tearing patches out you niggas ass\nAll y'all niggas, I don't give a fuck who you running with\nThis is thug life nigga, the new generation motherfucker\nYoung Thugs we chin checking all you junior high school motherfuckers\nY'all better feel this shit, don't make enemies with these niggas\nYou better be friendly motherfucker, I swear to God\nWe running through, smile from handshake\n",
