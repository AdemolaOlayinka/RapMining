So now I'm back\nto makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true\nWhat if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on\nTryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin\nI'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close\nTo packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost\nTell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go\nTo clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control\nMy heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave\nwhen we conspire to conceive, and now\nYou gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin\nThat's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'\nNever no more will you see me, this is the end\nCause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love\ndamn, sucka for love... sucka for love\nsucka for love\n\nNow he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay\nAs you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away\nIt wasn't always a hit and run relationship\nIt use to be love, happieness and companionship\nRemember when I treated you good\nI moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood\nMe and you a happy home, when it was on\nI had a love to call my own\nI shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes\nPreoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie\nYou had a man and I knew it, you told me\nDon't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure\nMake a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone\nI'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh\nI wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness\nbut I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love\nsucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love\n\nI'ma sucka for love, sucka for love\nSucka for love\n",
