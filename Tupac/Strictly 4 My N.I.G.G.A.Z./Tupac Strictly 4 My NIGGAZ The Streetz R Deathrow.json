    "lyrics": "Growing up as an inner city brotha\nWhere every other had a pops and a motha\nI was the product of a heated lover.\nNobody knew how deep it screwed me\nAnd since my pops never knew me\nMy family didn't know what to do with me.\nWas I somebody they despised?\nCurious look in they eyes\nAs if they wonder if I'm dead or alive\nAnd poor momma can't control me\n\"Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!\"\nA ticken timebomb, can't nobody fade me\nPackin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes\nSuckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot\nPunks drop from all the buckshots the fools got\nI'm tired of being a nice guy\nI've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why\nSo they label me a lunatic\nCould care less death or success\nIs what I quest 'cause I'm fearless\nNow the streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow.\n\nI just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed wearin' a vest\nHopin' that they're aimin' at my chest\nMuch too young to bite the bullet\nHand on the trigga\nI see my life before my eyes each time I pull it\nI hope I live to be a man\nMust be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen\nCounting pennys over the years I'd done stacked many\nProving wrong those\nWho swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty\nNow they gotta cope\nSince it's the only thing I know\nIt's difficult to let it go\nI'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry\nHustlin' to keep from gettin' buried\nBut now I gotta move away now\n'Cause these suckers love ta' spray where I lay down\nMy homie lost his family, he snapped;\nShot up half the block to bring them back\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow.\n\nI'm dangerous when drunk I only drink beer\nGin makes me sin\nUnable to think clear\nHenessey makes me think my enemy is getting close\nBOOM BOOM BOOM\nGot me shooting at a ghost\nSome call me crazy but this is what you gave me\nAmongst the babies who raised up from the slavery\nI sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress\nMoved out west and I invest in all the best\nThose who test will find a bullet in they chest\nPut to rest by a brotha who was hopeless\nGrow up broke on the rope of insanity\nHow many pistols smoking coming from a broken family\nI'm sick of being tired\nSick of the sirens, body bags, and the gun firing\nTell Bush, \"Push the button!\" 'cause I'm fed\nTired of hearin' these voices in my head\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow.\n\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow\n('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')\nThis goes out to my partners in the Live Squad\n(like it ain't nothin')\nAnd all my partners involved in that 187\nWatch your back\n('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')\nThere got to be a better way\n('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')\nThere's too many of us in the cemetery\n('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')\nCome on, what we gonna do now\n('cause I'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')\nThe streets are deathrow\n",
