What do you know?)\n(Only real niggas stay on top)\nEverybody talking 'bout Pac's life\n(Outlawz)\n\nStarted with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him\nNever figured that, that same nigga sell five million\nHit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits\nCourt cases got a nigga facing multiple digits\nDodging cop cars look how we come so far\nPicture a high school drop out\nRolling a double R\nHouse full of happiness, weed and drank\nWay out\nSo when trouble tried to find me can't\nNever visioned living longer than my twenty first\nThought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt\nAnd though it hurts to see the change\nIt comes with the fame\nWatch them gossip in this silly game\nTo all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night\nWhy's everybody caught up In Pac's life?\nTo all y'all niggas\nConversating on my life\nMind your motherfucking business\n\n\nI remember that\nAy\nWhat's happening Pac\nYeah I know we never got to meet\nBut we know all the same people so we got to speak\nYou taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G\nAnd all the shit you went through\nMeant a lot to me\nBut when they locked you up for for nothing it was shame to see\nYou we know the crack came and did the same thing to me\nI get along with real niggas it's the lane to be\nTalking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me\nAnd so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see\nNow they all in the court room blaming me\nSee we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle\nPower to the real niggas death to the sucker's\nMoney over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em\nDeath before dishonour never talk to undercover's\nLive by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's\nWith the same sort of dude with he same short fuse\n\n\nI want money in large amounts\nMy garage full of cars that bounce\nMoving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts\nBusters is jealous and half these niggas is punks\nThey running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump\nThey jump my automatic keep 'em weary\nWhile you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass\nNigga you scary\nI been knowing you for years\nWe was high school peers\nIn Junior High\nI was itching' to kill\nAnd you was, 'Ready To Die'\nWhile you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases\nBusting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places\nLeaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried\nBitches die in a hurry\nStill I ride, I'm never worried\nMr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride\nPick my enemies out the crowd\nAnd motherfucker's die\nIt's not the way I wanna live\nMy nigga it's how it is\nOnly real niggas stay on top\n\nWhy are all you niggas all up in my shit?\nTell them motherfucker's\nOutlawz\nFuck all y'all\n",
