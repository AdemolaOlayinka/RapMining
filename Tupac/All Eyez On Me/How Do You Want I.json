Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker\nInstead of tryin' to help a nigga you destroy a brother\nWorse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mr. Bob Dole\nYou're too old to understand the way the game's told\nYou're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts\nOnce I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that\nThey wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell\nLivin' in hell - only a few of us'll live to tell\nNow everybody talkin' about us I could give a fuck\nI'd be the first one to bomb and cuss\nNigga, tell me how you want it\n\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\n\nRaised as a youth\nTell the truth, I got the scoop\nOn how to get a bulletproof\nCause I jumped from the roof\n'fore I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager\nGame rules, I'm livin' major - my adversaries\nIs lookin' worried, they paranoid of gettin' buried\nOne of us gonna see the cemetery\nMy only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive\nGettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die\nI wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million\nAnd then I'm chillin' fade 'em all\nThese taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me\nMedia is in my business and they actin' like they know me\nBut I'ma mash out and peel out\nI\u2019m with a clique that\u2019s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out\nYeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it\nWhen you see me, tell a nigga how you want it\nHow do you want it?\n\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\n\nMe and my Nigga Johnny J... yeah we out\n\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\n\nHow do you want it?\nHow do you feel?\nComin' up as a nigga in the cash game\nLivin' in the fast lane\nI'm for real\n",
