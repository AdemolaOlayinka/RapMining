    "lyrics": "You find an MC like me who's strong\nLeavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support\nAnd when I command the microphone I get deadly as Khan though\nWith a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those\nWho can withstand the more power I gain\nAnd make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain\nImagine and keep on wishin' upon a star\nFinally realizin' who the fuck we are\nWhen I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded\nWould it be the greatest MC of all time when I created rhyme\nFor the simple fact, when I attack, I crush your pride\nMy intention to ride, every time on lye\nI'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar\nFor me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride\nBreakin' in gas with the '68 all day\nIn-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies\n\nSo mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation\nSo you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'\nWe must be patient, nothin' better than communication\nKnown to damage and highly flammable like gas stations\nSorry I left that ass waitin'\nNo more procrastination, give up to fate and get that ass shakin'\nI'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic\nDon't take your life for granted\nPut that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted\nMy lyrics motivate the planet\nIt's similar to Rhythm Nation, but thugged out, forgive me, Janet\nWho's in control, I'm activatin' your souls\nYou know the way the games get controlled\nYo, two years ago, a friend of mine\nTold me Alize and Cristal blows your mind\nBear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote\nTakin' off my coat, clearin' my throat\n\nI got my mind made up, come on\nGet in, get into\nLet it ride, tonight's the night\nI got my mind made up, come on\nGet in, get into\nLet it ride, tonight's the night\n\nWell I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylactics\nFor protection so my fuckin' sac won't collapse\nCause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays\nSendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave\nI wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MC's\nShows my heart's as cold as the tundra\nElectrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much\nRough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch\nI'm an, MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay\nYou got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei\nMy rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind\nAs the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm\nThere's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'\nI use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin''\nOpposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain\nLaughter enhances the chances of the killin'\nWhy is that? Cause smilin' faces deceive\nYou best believe: to MC's, I'm the deadliest disease\nMy thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe\nYour whole camp's under siege and I'm Jason Voorhees\nIn the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics\nMy verbal snipe your vocabs on site\nI'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all\nSo all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall\nYou already have an idea about the superior sphere\nThe greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator\nI rock from here to there, to Philly and back\nTo LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps\nAs your views get overshadowed when you come in contact\nBeware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat\n\nFuck you losers, while you fake jacks, I makes manoeuvres\nLike Hitler, stickin' up Jews with German Lugers\nThe Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle\nWill be back after this message, don't touch the dial\nRarely do you see an MC out for justice\nGot my gun powder and my musket, blaow\nMelons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan\nHalf of my Clan's repeat felons\nNiggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel\nMan, I stay on point like icicles\nNow who wanna test Tical, then touch Tical\nAll up in your motherfuckin' mouth\nHeadbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie\nMethod Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me\nBetter take one and pass or that's that ass\nYour vital statistics are low and fallin' fast\nJohnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash\nPlay a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast\n\nLyrical gats spittin' the criminal tactics\nNon-believers get my dick and genitals backwards\nLet's face it, there's no replacement\nTaste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with\nAvalanche on your whole camp when I'm spliffted\nFunk Doctor who, Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted\nI got connects like Federal Express\nTo get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch\nGot the clear spot from the rear block\nTo bust 'til every nigga here drop, men I fear not\nHold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop\nSince your crew suit you to shift, now you claim that your gears locked\nWhiff this underground cannabis\nI'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst\nFlip MC's like ki's\nMy degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's\nLick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake\nSo I erase the whole front row at the wake\nI planned my escape in case Jake wann' snake bust it\nI'm the one pushin' the hearse in the first place\nConfidence for you shaky-ass folks\nPump for Rockafeller for the day he got smoked\nChoke off this antidote, got you ope\nGet roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt\nAnd I'm out for 9-nickel\n",
