She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\n\nHow's it hangin? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin\nI've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang\nWon't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin\nThis bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin\nI'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze\nYou're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies\nShe got a body make a motherfucker fantasize\nHer face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes\nMy sister precious in poverty\nPlus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?\nI'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue\nAnd though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come\nI've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?\nLet me show you, got some hookers we can toss later\nBefore I let her get me, I got her\nWent in her purse took a hundred dollars\nNigga I'm so scandalous\n\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\n\nDangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches\nI'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches\nCurrency motivated, not easily terminated\nNow that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded\nThis is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid\nAll you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves\nI thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true\nWhen I don't fuck with your punk crew\nThese are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell\nI went from hell, to livin well\nBustin at niggaz who said my name in vain\nI got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game\nI wanna be a baller, please\nBut the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me\nI'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans\nCan't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous\n\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\n\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nScandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\nShe's so scandalous. She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous\n(Aiyyo. How the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be\nYou ever peep that shit? (Nah)\nA bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35\nGettin him for ends\nHoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent\nWhen these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then\nThat's aight though\nKeep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long\nWatch them hoes\nAll you niggaz out there\nBeware these lyin ass scandalous bitches)\n",
