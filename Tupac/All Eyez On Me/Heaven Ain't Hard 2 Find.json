Strip naked get to love makin'\nSee it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine\nI fantasize 'til that ass is mine\nNever gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'\nA straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'\nStop with the beeper, baby, listen\nI know you're grown but pay attention\nLet me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'\nThis is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes\nTurn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find\n\nHea-ven!\n(Heaven ain't hard to find)\nHeaven ain't hard to find\nHeaven ain't hard to find\nIn fact you can have it just have faith\nJust like a little kid, still believin' in magic\nIt takes a lot of sacrifice\nWith all the lonely nights on tour\nI need somebody I can trust in my life\nLet me apply the brakes\nBaby, you're movin' to fast\nMy conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask\nAre you afraid of a thug?\nAnd have you ever made love\nWith candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?\nTouch me and let me activate your blood pressure\nThis thug passion help the average man love better\nPicture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist\nTake a shot of that Aliz\u00e9, come give me a kiss\nAnd maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer\nI'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier\nAnd I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind\nBut relax, in due time\nHeaven Ain't Hard to Find\n\nHea-ven!\n(Heaven ain't hard to find)\nHea-ven! It ain't hard to find\nYou think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you\nBeen talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken\nThrough my eye contact I wink and you respond back\nLookin' mean, what's all that?\nIt's like the closer you get\nBaby, the quicker I'm speakin'\nI got a flight out to Cabo\nLet's kick it this weekend\nI'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke\nThough addicted to weed smoke\nI'm fiendin' for your body even mo'\nOh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts\nYour hidden motives full of passion\nWho would have thought?\nCome holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature\nFar from a playa hater, label me a money maker,\nStraight heart breaker\nBaby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz\nWe'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends\nOnce we begin\nUntil the end, it gets better with time\nI'm makin' love to your mind, baby\nHeaven ain't hard to find\n\nHea-ven! Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find)\n(Heaven ain't hard to find)\n(Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize)\nHea-ven! Hea-ven! Hea-ven. Heaven\nHea-ven! It ain't hard to find\nHea-ven! Heaven\nIt ain't hard to find\nIt ain't hard to find\nIt ain't hard to find\n",
