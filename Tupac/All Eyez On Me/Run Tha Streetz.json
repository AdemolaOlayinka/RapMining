through\nI'll be waiting\n\nHey yo storm\nHonestly I think I can fuck wit' a motherfucker like you\nSee I don't like a motherfucker that be all lonely and shit\nAll up under me, telling me we having gold, in case she gold ringing\nWhen I'm coming home and all of that ol' crazy shit\nWhat type of life I live\n\nNow peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa\nSome love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later\nIt don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart\nMust be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark\nPlus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol\nAnd wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you\nCan you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy\nDon't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me\nDo you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest\nA thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest\nI bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out\nAnd felt the pleasure and the pain\nAbout to fuck the very taste out your mouth\nIf you call me when you need me\n1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me\nCause I can be your man\nAnd, baby, you can be my lady\nBut you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy\nRun the streets\n\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\n\nYo 'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo\nBut I gotta do what I gotta do\nI gotta run the streets you know\nI ain't no clean up one minute, type ho'\nYou know\n\nNow me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool\nCan't make no money in bed\nSo ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya\nCan't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money\n9 times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world\nBut real women make the shit go around\nDisrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down\nThrow up the block cause nothin' stops my chips\nI boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks\nHoller if you understand my plan, ladies\nFuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas, swearin' he can save me\nMy strategy's official\nCheckin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya\nSoft as tissue\nSo my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'\nThey call me Storm from the day I was born\nI been known to break the coldest motherfucker, 'til his hearts warm\nI ain't never been the type to wait at home alone\nJust cause we bone\nDon't mean you own me\nNigga, I'm grown\n\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\n\nHahhahaha yeah nigga\nLet nigga hang out with the homies, you know baby\nAye a nigga that hang out more\nWill come home, and love you better\nYou feel me sweetheart?\nLet a nigga be free\nDon't had a nigga all up on thee\nLet him run with his niggas\nLet the nigga run the street boo, let him run the streets\n\nI'd rather run the streets to make some mail\nAnd put the game down tight\nFor these gamin' bitches could get it right\nIt might be a plan that I'm chosen\nDon't get in confusion\nBecause I'm known for showin' examples how I do it\nThinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger\nWhere I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder\nAnd at the end I make a come up\nNigga, was raised up off of M.O.B.\nFetti over something\nThat's tellin' me don't run the streets\n\nSo tell me am I wrong ?\nFor tryin' to communicate through a song\nI'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone\nAll my homies is waitin' for me\nPlottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be\nSo meet me at 3'\nAnd don't be late nigga\nWe hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor\nI heard it's poppin' at a club\nBut they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug\nUntil I die\nI'll be game related\nGot me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated\nNow that we made it\nIt's a battle just for the big money\nI'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny\nI came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it\nI only got one chance, so I gotta take it\nYa never know when it's all gonna happen\nThe rappin' or the drugs\nBut until then give me love\nAnd let me run the streets\n\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\n\nLet the nigga run the streets boo - I hate you hahah\nI'll call you back\nJust let me hang with my niggas\nWhy you actin' like that Michel'le, Ha?\nYou know nigga wanna kick it with his homboys and shit\nI told ya I was coming back later on - right?\nSo you don't believe a nigga\nJust cook for a nigga - pleaaaaase!\nMake some of that shit you made last meal\nSome of them breads and shit\nI'll be back through later tonight\nI'm hashing weed\nWe finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize\nWe finna eat that foods\nSmoking ol' blunt\nLay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno and something\nThen after that, shit do what after comes to mind baby\nJust let a nigga run with the homies\nLet me go kick it with my niggas\nWhen I come back, I be all yours\nFor real\n\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\nYou can run the streets with your thugs\nI been waiting for you\nUntil you get through\nI'll be waiting\n",
