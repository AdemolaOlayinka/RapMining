You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs

Hey yo storm
Honestly I think I can fuck wit' a motherfucker like you
See I don't like a motherfucker that be all lonely and shit
All up under me, telling me we having gold, in case she gold ringing
When I'm coming home and all of that ol' crazy shit
What type of life I live

Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me
Cause I can be your man
And, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

Yo 'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo
But I gotta do what I gotta do
I gotta run the streets you know
I ain't no clean up one minute, type ho'
You know

Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you, I ain't the bitch to love ya
Can't do a damn thang for you, if ya ain't about money
9 times outta 10, I'll ignore you, it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holler if you understand my plan, ladies
Fuck havin' babies by them shady ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, 'til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just cause we bone
Don't mean you own me
Nigga, I'm grown

You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting

Hahhahaha yeah nigga
Let nigga hang out with the homies, you know baby
Aye a nigga that hang out more
Will come home, and love you better
You feel me sweetheart?
Let a nigga be free
Don't had a nigga all up on thee
Let him run with his niggas
Let the nigga run the street boo, let him run the streets

I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm chosen
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B.
Fetti over something
That's tellin' me don't run the streets

So tell me am I wrong ?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3'
And don't be late nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
Ya never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love
And let me run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs

Why you actin' like that Michel'le, Ha?
You know nigga wanna kick it with his homboys and shit
I told ya I was coming back later on - right?
So you don't believe a nigga
Just cook for a nigga - pleaaaaase!
Make some of that shit you made last meal
Some of them breads and shit
I'll be back through later tonight
I'm hashing weed
We finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize
We finna eat that foods
Smoking ol' blunt
Lay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno and something
Then after that, shit do what after comes to mind baby
Just let a nigga run with the homies
Let me go kick it with my niggas
When I come back, I be all yours
For real
