Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin'\nWon't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson\nThuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it\nLet them other brothers try, at least you tried for it\nWhen it's time to die, to be a man\nAnd pick the way you leave\nFuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\nLet's get ready to rumble\nMy murderous lyrics\nEquipped with spirits of the thugs before me\nPay off the block, evade the cops\n'Cause I know they coming for me\nI been hesitant to reappear, been away for years\nNow I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears\nQuestion my methods to switch up speeds\nSure as some bitches bleed\nNiggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed\nBlast me, but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)\ndidn't diminish my powers\nSo now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards\nThat's why they tried to set me up\nHad bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed they wet me up\nBut I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated\nAt the time I contemplate the way that God made it\nLace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary\nFor money I'll have these motherfuckers buried\nI been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it\nKnowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it\nWitness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside\nthe cry from all your people when they find her\nJust remind ya, my history'll prove authentic\nRevenge on them niggas that played me\nAnd all the cowards that was down with it\nNow it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'\nCatch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah\nI won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah\nYou don't wanna fuck with me\nGot the police bustin' at me\nBut they can't do nothin' to a G\nLet's get ready to rumble\n",
