Like they can't see us and like we don't be at the same spots they be at?\nIt's the same congregation. Young Pac is back, youknowhatImean?\nNigga be lookin' all the way when he see you and shit\nIt's a celebration\nMotherfuckers better understand this shit\nYoung 'Pac is back\nAy D-Shot, nigga, can we get paid man?\nCan we just go there and sock this shit up, please?\nHey, we smokin', and we ain't hard to find\nDrinkin' and shit, fuckin' with some Hurricane\nA motherfucker's gonna get his marbles regardless, playboy\nYou supposed to\nSideways to the next light, and to the next coast, poppin' the muthafuckin' most, you understand what I'm sayin'\nMoney over bitches, nigga, M.O.B., M.O.B.\n",
