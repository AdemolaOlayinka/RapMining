(You can't touch this)\nYo, sound the bell, school is in, sucker (You can't touch this)\nGive me a song, or rhythm\nMake 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em now,\nThey know\nYou talking about the Hammer you talking about a show\nThat's hyped, and tight\nSingers are sweating so pass them a wipe\nOr a tape, to learn\nWhat's it gonna take in the 90's to burn\nThe charts? Legit\nEither work hard or you might as well quit\nThat's word because you know...\nYou can't touch this\nBreak it down!\nStop, Hammer time!\nGo with the flow, it is said\nIf you can't groove to this then you probably are dead\nSo wave your hands in the air\nBust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair\nThis is it, for a winner\nDance to this and you're gonna get thinner\nMove, slide your rump\nJust for a minute let's all do the bump, bump, bump, bump\nYeah... (You can't touch this)\nLook, man (You can't touch this)\nYou better get hype, boy, because you know you can't (You can't touch this)\nRing the bell, school's back in\nBreak it down!\nStop, Hammer time!\nYou can't touch this\nBreak it down!\nStop, Hammer time!\nEvery time you see me\nThe Hammer's just so hype\nI'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic\nNow why would I ever stop doing this?\nWith others making records that just don't hit\nI've toured around the world, from London to the Bay\nIt's \"Hammer, go Hammer, MC Hammer, yo Hammer\"\nAnd the rest can go and play\nYou can't touch this\n",
