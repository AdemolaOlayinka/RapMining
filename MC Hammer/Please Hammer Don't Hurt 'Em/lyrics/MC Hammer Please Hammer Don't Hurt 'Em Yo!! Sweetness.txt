That's word, we pray, pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
All my life I wanted to make it to the top
Some said I wouldn't, they told me no but I didn't stop
Working hard, making those movies everyday
And on my knees, every night, you know I pray
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
Now I just think that you can do whatever you want
I'm bustin' these rhymes, making this money and I won't
Forget my people or my town or my ways
And on my knees, every night, I'm still gonna pray
That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
Time and time and time and time and time again
I kept on knocking but these people wouldn't let me in
I tried and tried and tried and tried to make a way
But nothing happened till that day that I prayed
That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We got to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
Children dying, oh so fast from this or that
Need that money, bookin' that dope, smokin' that crack
Ten years old, stand outside, better looked out
Dead and gone, never had a chance, what's it all about?
That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today that's word, we pray
Pray, pray, that's word we pray, that's word we pray
That's word, we pray, that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
All our missions start to doubt, here we go
Kicking back, read these words, we need to know
Living high, living good, living long
Take a minute, bust a prayer and you're good to go
That's word, we pray, pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today
I said, "We pray", pray, ah yeah, we pray, pray
We need to pray just to make it today, that's word, we pray
We're sending this one out to the Lord and we thank you
And we know, we need to pray, 'cause all the blessings
That are good they come from above and once again we want
To say, "Thank you" to the Lord with all our love, we are here
That's word, we pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
That's word, we pray, that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray, that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
That's word, we pray, pray, pray that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray, that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray, pray, pray
That's word, we pray, pray, pray
That's word, we pray, pray, pray, that's word, we pray
That's word, we pray
