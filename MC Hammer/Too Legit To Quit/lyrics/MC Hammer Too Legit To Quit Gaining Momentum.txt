Gaining Momentum
Gaining, 
Gaining Momentum There it is 
Start slow like our bodies won't flow
And set em up good then let go
Parton (sic) me, I'm begging your parton, but I feel like startin something.
Now that the music has got me moving, come on baby and let's get into the party b4 we get left out. A little bit of time & we'll turn it out.

To my place & pump her up loud
