A little bit of time & we'll turn it out.\nGaining Momentum There it is\nI think that you like it this way. Can I get a no, a yes or a yay? Good cause I do refuse to ever give you something that you cannot use. Dance & express yourself, mix, mingle, & jump up to the Left or Right, it's goin' on tonite. I'm gaining momentum I'm getting' hype\nGaining Momentum There it is\nGaining\n\nDon't you know we're gaining momentum We can't stop, no don't you know we're gaining momentum, we're headed to the top.\nGaining Momentum There it is\nGaining\nGet in drums, cymbals,\nSounds of (shakers?)\nIf music was a lady I'd take her\nTo my place & pump her up loud\nAnd play her for the homies and\nFront her to the crowd\nMary, Nary Nothing ordinary\nMusic moves and it buries style but it still gets in them you can't stop it cause it's gaining momentum\nGaining Momentum There it is\n\nGaining Momentum There it is\nWe can't stop There it is\nNow see we got the place jumping\nTold ya that I felt like starting something\nPump 'em, stump 'em Make your body jump up. when your life is gonna blow up moving, improving, that's what we're doing, nothing negative get in cause your mind will be ruined. Aim for the top and go straight up in nothing will stop you when you gaining momentum.\nGaining Momentum There it is\n\nGaining Momentum There it is\n",
