I like it! I like it! You punk tricks!\nMan you know you wanna cus them fools out!\nRedman, Gonna put em on the hoe stroll!\nDres, gonna put em on the hoe stroll!\nQ-tip, gonna put em on the hoe stroll!\nRodney O, already on the hoe stroll!\nSearch couldn't sell on the hoe stroll!\nMan what about Run D.
