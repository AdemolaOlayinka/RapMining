A young fool on a flex\nTryin to get a name, Some props, Or rep\nI stepped right to him let em know it's all good\nLights out! Now his crib is wood\nBroke for the dough, But now I can't see\nIt's blood on my hands my dog yo, g?\nI hit the flo, But my heart didn't stop\nAnd now I see a vision of my son wit no pop\nMy mama's on her knees\nLord, Lord no please\nAnd I feel cold and my health is cheatin\nIt's gettin dark, But yet and still\nI'm half dead, Half life, What's real?\nI can't breathe, But now I'm startin to choke\nOff my own blood and not that indo smoke\nNo joke, Straight up, On a serious tip\nI'm losin my life, I'm losin my grip\nI slip, ssssslip deeper still\nHelp lord, Help lord, I'm losin my will\nTo live, Low, Stuck at the bottom\nFrom winter to spring to summer to autumn\nHelp lord, The homies in the hood\nThe squares, The g's, It's all good\nHelp lord, Cause in the hood we sprung\nAnd we stuck right here until you come\nAnd bless the children of the ghetto life\nNo love, No hope, No hope, No life\nHelp lord, Help Lord, Help lord, Help lord\nYou hear me callin lord?\n",
